<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes
which showed that he had not forgotten nor for-
given. &#8220;Well, he can come if he wants,&#8221; he said in
a surly voice. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough. The sooner we get
to work the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The company broke up with shouts and yells
and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still
crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren
remained there. The little band who had been told
off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding
in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not
to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night,
with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty,
star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered
in a yard which faced a high building. The words
&#8220;Vermissa Herald&#8221; were printed in gold lettering
between the brightly lit windows. From within
came the clanking of the printing press.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you,&#8221; said Baldwin to McMurdo, &#8220;you
can stand below at the door and see that the road
is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with
you. You others come with me. Have no fears,
boys; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in
the Union Bar at this very moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight, and the street was de-
serted save for one or two revellers upon their way
home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing
open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin
and his men rushed in and up the stair which
faced them. McMurdo and another remained be-
low. From the room above came a shout, a cry for
help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of
falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man
rushed out on the landing.
</p>
<p>He was seized before he could get farther, and
his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo&#8217;s
feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was on
his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering to-
gether as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his
</p>
<p>long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. The
others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face
set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man&#8217;s
head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with
his arms. His white hair was dabbled with patches
of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his vic-
tim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he
could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed
up the stair and pushed him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kill the man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Drop it!&#8221;
Baldwin looked at him in amazement. &#8220;Curse
</p>
<p>you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Who are you to interfere&#8212;you
that are new to the lodge? Stand back!&#8221; He raised
his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out
of his hip pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back yourself!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll blow your
face in if you lay a hand on me. As to the lodge,
wasn&#8217;t it the order of the Bodymaster that the man
was not to be killed&#8212;and what are you doing but
killing him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s truth he says,&#8221; remarked one of the men.
&#8220;By Gar! you&#8217;d best hurry yourselves!&#8221; cried
</p>
<p>the man below. &#8220;The windows are all lighting up,
and you&#8217;ll have the whole town here inside of five
minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was indeed the sound of shouting in the
street, and a little group of compositors and press-
men was forming in the hall below and nerving
itself to action. Leaving the limp and motion-
less body of the editor at the head of the stair,
the criminals rushed down and made their way
swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union
House, some of them mixed with the crowd in
McGinty&#8217;s saloon, whispering across the bar to the
Boss that the job had been well carried through.
Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away
into side streets, and so by devious paths to their
own homes.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
The Valley of Fear
</p>
<p>When McMurdo awoke next morning he had
good reason to remember his initiation into the
lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink,
and his arm, where he had been branded, was hot
</p>
<p>and swollen. Having his own peculiar source of
income, he was irregular in his attendance at his
work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at
home for the morning writing a long letter to a
</p>
<p>720</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley of Fear
</p>
<p>friend. Afterwards he read the Daily Herald. In a
special column put in at the last moment he read:
</p>
<p>Outrage at the herald office &#8212;
Editor seriously injured
</p>
<p>It was a short account of the facts with which he
was himself more familiar than the writer could
have been. It ended with the statement:
</p>
<p>The matter is now in the hands of the po-
lice; but it can hardly be hoped that their
exertions will be attended by any better re-
sults than in the past. Some of the men
were recognized, and there is hope that a
conviction may be obtained. The source
of the outrage was, it need hardly be said,
that infamous society which has held this
community in bondage for so long a pe-
riod, and against which the Herald has
taken so uncompromising a stand. Mr.
Stanger&#8217;s many friends will rejoice to hear
that, though he has been cruelly and bru-
tally beaten, and though he has sustained
severe injuries about the head, there is no
immediate danger to his life.
</p>
<p>Below it stated that a guard of police, armed with
Winchester rifles, had been requisitioned for the
defense of the office.
</p>
<p>McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was
lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky
from the excesses of the previous evening, when
there was a knock outside, and his landlady
brought to him a note which had just been handed
in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:
</p>
<p>I should wish to speak to you, but
would rather not do so in your house.
You will find me beside the flagstaff
upon Miller Hill. If you will come there
now, I have something which it is im-
portant for you to hear and for me to
say.
</p>
<p>McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost
surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant
or who was the author of it. Had it been in a femi-
nine hand, he might have imagined that it was the
beginning of one of those adventures which had
been familiar enough in his past life. But it was
the writing of a man, and of a well educated one,
too. Finally, after some hesitation, he determined
to see the matter through.
</p>
<p>Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very
centre of the town. In summer it is a favourite
resort of the people; but in winter it is desolate
enough. From the top of it one has a view not only
of the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the
</p>
<p>winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines
and factories blackening the snow on each side of
it, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges
flanking it.
</p>
<p>McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged
in with evergreens until he reached the deserted
restaurant which forms the centre of summer gai-
ety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath
it a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his
overcoat turned up. When he turned his face Mc-
Murdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had
incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night be-
fore. The lodge sign was given and exchanged as
they met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to have a word with you, Mr. Mc-
Murdo,&#8221; said the older man, speaking with a
hesitation which showed that he was on delicate
ground. &#8220;It was kind of you to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not put your name to the note?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One has to be cautious, mister. One never
knows in times like these how a thing may come
back to one. One never knows either who to trust
or who not to trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely one may trust brothers of the lodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, not always,&#8221; cried Morris with vehe-
mence. &#8220;Whatever we say, even what we think,
seems to go back to that man McGinty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; said McMurdo sternly. &#8220;It was
only last night, as you know well, that I swore
good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be ask-
ing me to break my oath?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is the view you take,&#8221; said Morris sadly,
&#8220;I can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trou-
ble to come and meet me. Things have come to a
bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their
thoughts to each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo, who had been watching his com-
panion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his
bearing. &#8220;Sure I spoke for myself only,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I am a newcomer, as you know, and I am strange
to it all. It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr.
Morris, and if you think well to say anything to
me I am here to hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to take it back to Boss McGinty!&#8221; said
Morris bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, then, you do me injustice there,&#8221; cried
McMurdo. &#8220;For myself I am loyal to the lodge, and
so I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature
if I were to repeat to any other what you might say
to me in confidence. It will go no further than me;
though I warn you that you may get neither help
nor sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>721</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given up looking for either the one or
the other,&#8221; said Morris. &#8220;I may be putting my very
life in your hands by what I say; but, bad as you
are&#8212;and it seemed to me last night that you were
shaping to be as bad as the worst&#8212;still you are
new to it, and your conscience cannot yet be as
hardened as theirs. That was why I thought to
speak with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what have you to say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give me away, may a curse be on you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I said I would not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would ask you, then, when you joined the
Freeman&#8217;s society in Chicago and swore vows of
charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your mind
that you might find it would lead you to crime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you call it crime,&#8221; McMurdo answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it crime!&#8221; cried Morris, his voice vibrating
with passion. &#8220;You have seen little of it if you can
call it anything else. Was it crime last night when
a man old enough to be your father was beaten till
the blood dripped from his white hairs? Was that
crime&#8212;or what else would you call it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some would say it was war,&#8221; said
McMurdo, &#8220;a war of two classes with all in, so
that each struck as best it could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you think of such a thing when you
joined the Freeman&#8217;s society at Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m bound to say I did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It
was just a benefit club and a meeting place for
one&#8217;s fellows. Then I heard of this place&#8212;curse the
hour that the name first fell upon my ears!&#8212;and I
came to better myself! My God! to better my-
self! My wife and three children came with me. I
started a dry goods store on Market Square, and I
prospered well. The word had gone round that I
was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local
lodge, same as you did last night. I&#8217;ve the badge
of shame on my forearm and something worse
branded on my heart. I found that I was under
the orders of a black villain and caught in a mesh-
work of crime. What could I do? Every word I said
to make things better was taken as treason, same
as it was last night. I can&#8217;t get away; for all I have
in the world is in my store. If I leave the society,
I know well that it means murder to me, and God
knows what to my wife and children. Oh, man,
it is awful&#8212;awful!&#8221; He put his hands to his face,
and his body shook with convulsive sobs.
</p>
<p>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;You were
too soft for the job,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You are the wrong
sort for such work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a conscience and a religion; but they
made me a criminal among them. I was chosen for
a job. If I backed down I knew well what would
come to me. Maybe I&#8217;m a coward. Maybe it&#8217;s the
thought of my poor little woman and the children
that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will
haunt me forever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here,
over the range yonder. I was told off for the door,
same as you were last night. They could not trust
me with the job. The others went in. When they
came out their hands were crimson to the wrists.
As we turned away a child was screaming out of
the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had
seen his father murdered. I nearly fainted with
the horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and
smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it
would be out of my house that they would come
next with their bloody hands and it would be my
little Fred that would be screaming for his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was a criminal then, part sharer in a mur-
der, lost forever in this world, and lost also in the
next. I am a good Catholic; but the priest would
have no word with me when he heard I was a
Scowrer, and I am excommunicated from my faith.
That&#8217;s how it stands with me. And I see you go-
ing down the same road, and I ask you what the
end is to be. Are you ready to be a cold-blooded
murderer also, or can we do anything to stop it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked McMurdo
abruptly. &#8220;You would not inform?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God forbid!&#8221; cried Morris. &#8220;Sure, the very
thought would cost me my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well,&#8221; said McMurdo. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking
that you are a weak man and that you make too
much of the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much! Wait till you have lived here longer.
Look down the valley! See the cloud of a hun-
dred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you that
the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than
that over the heads of the people. It is the Valley
of Fear, the Valley of Death. The terror is in the
hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn.
Wait, young man, and you will learn for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll let you know what I think when I
have seen more,&#8221; said McMurdo carelessly. &#8220;What
is very clear is that you are not the man for the
place, and that the sooner you sell out&#8212;if you
only get a dime a dollar for what the business is
worth&#8212;the better it will be for you. What you have
said is safe with me; but, by Gar! if I thought you
were an informer&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried Morris piteously.
</p>
<p>722</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it rest at that. I&#8217;ll bear what you have
said in mind, and maybe some day I&#8217;ll come back
to it. I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me
like this. Now I&#8217;ll be getting home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One word before you go,&#8221; said Morris. &#8220;We
may have been seen together. They may want to
know what we have spoken about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! that&#8217;s well thought of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I offer you a clerkship in my store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I refuse it. That&#8217;s our business. Well, so
long, Brother Morris, and may you find things go
better with you in the future.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smok-
ing, lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting-
room, the door swung open and its framework
was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty.
He passed the sign, and then seating himself op-
posite to the young man he looked at him steadily
for some time, a look which was as steadily re-
turned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,&#8221;
he said at last. &#8220;I guess I am too busy over the folk
that visit me. But I thought I&#8217;d stretch a point and
drop down to see you in your own house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud to see you here, Councillor,&#8221; Mc-
Murdo answered heartily, bringing his whisky bot-
tle out of the cupboard. &#8220;It&#8217;s an honour that I had
not expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the arm?&#8221; asked the Boss.
</p>
<p>McMurdo made a wry face. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not for-
getting it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but it&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; the other answered, &#8220;to
those that are loyal and go through with it and
are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking
to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morn-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question came so suddenly that it was well
that he had his answer prepared. He burst into a
hearty laugh. &#8220;Morris didn&#8217;t know I could earn a
living here at home. He shan&#8217;t know either; for he
has got too much conscience for the likes of me.
But he&#8217;s a good-hearted old chap. It was his idea
that I was at a loose end, and that he would do
me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry
goods store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you refused it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Couldn&#8217;t I earn ten times as much in my
own bedroom with four hours&#8217; work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. But I wouldn&#8217;t get about too much
with Morris.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I guess because I tell you not. That&#8217;s
</p>
<p>enough for most folk in these parts.&#8221;
&#8220;It may be enough for most folk; but it ain&#8217;t
</p>
<p>enough for me, Councillor,&#8221; said McMurdo boldly.
&#8220;If you are a judge of men, you&#8217;ll know that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The swarthy giant glared at him, and his hairy
paw closed for an instant round the glass as
though he would hurl it at the head of his com-
panion. Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous,
insincere fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer card, for sure,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well,
if you want reasons, I&#8217;ll give them. Did Morris say
nothing to you against the lodge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Nor against me?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s because he daren&#8217;t trust you. But
</p>
<p>in his heart he is not a loyal brother. We know that
well. So we watch him and we wait for the time to
admonish him. I&#8217;m thinking that the time is draw-
ing near. There&#8217;s no room for scabby sheep in our
pen. But if you keep company with a disloyal man,
we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no chance of my keeping company
with him; for I dislike the man,&#8221; McMurdo an-
swered. &#8220;As to being disloyal, if it was any man
but you he would not use the word to me twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said McGinty, draining
off his glass. &#8220;I came down to give you a word in
season, and you&#8217;ve had it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; said McMurdo, &#8220;how you
ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris
at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McGinty laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s my business to know
what goes on in this township,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I guess
you&#8217;d best reckon on my hearing all that passes.
Well, time&#8217;s up, and I&#8217;ll just say&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But his leavetaking was cut short in a very un-
expected fashion. With a sudden crash the door
flew open, and three frowning, intent faces glared
in at them from under the peaks of police caps.
McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his re-
volver; but his arm stopped midway as he became
conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled
at his head. A man in uniform advanced into the
room, a six-shooter in his hand. It was Captain
Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine
Constabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile
at McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be getting into trouble, Mr.
Crooked McMurdo of Chicago,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
</p>
<p>723</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and come
along with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll pay for this, Captain Marvin,&#8221;
said McGinty. &#8220;Who are you, I&#8217;d like to know, to
break into a house in this fashion and molest hon-
est, law-abiding men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re standing out in this deal, Councillor
McGinty,&#8221; said the police captain. &#8220;We are not out
after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is for
you to help, not to hinder us in our duty,&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a friend of mine, and I&#8217;ll answer for his
conduct,&#8221; said the Boss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to
answer for your own conduct some of these days,&#8221;
the captain answered. &#8220;This man McMurdo was a
crook before ever he came here, and he&#8217;s a crook
still. Cover him, Patrolman, while I disarm him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s my pistol,&#8221; said McMurdo coolly.
&#8220;Maybe, Captain Marvin, if you and I were alone
and face to face you would not take me so easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your warrant?&#8221; asked McGinty. &#8220;By
Gar! a man might as well live in Russia as in Ver-
missa while folk like you are running the police.
It&#8217;s a capitalist outrage, and you&#8217;ll hear more of it,
I reckon.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;You do what you think is your duty the best
way you can, Councillor. We&#8217;ll look after ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I accused of?&#8221; asked McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of being concerned in the beating of old Ed-
itor Stanger at the Herald office. It wasn&#8217;t your
fault that it isn&#8217;t a murder charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s all you have against him,&#8221; cried
McGinty with a laugh, &#8220;you can save yourself a
deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This man
was with me in my saloon playing poker up to
midnight, and I can bring a dozen to prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your affair, and I guess you can settle
it in court to-morrow. Meanwhile, come on, Mc-
Murdo, and come quietly if you don&#8217;t want a gun
across your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty;
for I warn you I will stand no resistance when I
am on duty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So determined was the appearance of the cap-

to accept the situation. The latter managed to have
a few whispered words with the prisoner before
they parted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about&#8212;&#8221; he jerked his thumb upward
to signify the coining plant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; whispered McMurdo, who had de-
vised a safe hiding place under the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bid you good-bye,&#8221; said the Boss, shaking
hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see Reilly the lawyer and take the de-
fense upon myself. Take my word for it that they
won&#8217;t be able to hold you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t bet on that. Guard the prisoner,
you two, and shoot him if he tries any games. I&#8217;ll
search the house before I leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did so; but apparently found no trace of the
concealed plant. When he had descended he and
his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters. Dark-
ness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing
so that the streets were nearly deserted; but a few
loiterers followed the group, and
