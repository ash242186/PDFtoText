</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
Lodge 341, Vermissa
</p>
<p>On the day following the evening which had
contained so many exciting events, McMurdo
moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter&#8217;s and
took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara&#8217;s
on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan,
his original acquaintance aboard the train, had oc-
casion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa,
and the two lodged together. There was no other
boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old
Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that
they had a freedom for speech and action welcome
to men who had secrets in common.
</p>
<p>Shafter had relented to the extent of letting Mc-
Murdo come to his meals there when he liked; so
that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means
broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more
intimate as the weeks went by.
</p>
<p>In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt
it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under
many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers
from the lodge were allowed to come in and see
them, each carrying away in his pocket some ex-
amples of the false money, so cunningly struck that
there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in
passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his
command, McMurdo should condescend to work
at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;
though he made it clear to anyone who asked him
that if he lived without any visible means it would
very quickly bring the police upon his track.
</p>
<p>One policeman was indeed after him already;
but the incident, as luck would have it, did the
adventurer a great deal more good than harm. Af-
ter the first introduction there were few evenings
when he did not find his way to McGinty&#8217;s saloon,
there to make closer acquaintance with &#8220;the boys,&#8221;
which was the jovial title by which the dangerous
gang who infested the place were known to one
another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of
speech made him a favourite with them all; while
the rapid and scientific way in which he polished
off his antagonist in an &#8220;all in&#8221; bar-room scrap
earned the respect of that rough community. An-
other incident, however, raised him even higher in
their estimation.
</p>
<p>Just at the crowded hour one night, the door
opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uni-
form and peaked cap of the mine police. This was
a special body raised by the railways and colliery
owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary
civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face
</p>
<p>of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the
district. There was a hush as he entered, and many
a curious glance was cast at him; but the rela-
tions between policemen and criminals are pecu-
liar in some parts of the States, and McGinty him-
self standing behind his counter, showed no sur-
prise when the policeman enrolled himself among
his customers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A straight whisky, for the night is bitter,&#8221; said
the police officer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have met be-
fore, Councillor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be the new captain?&#8221; said McGinty.
&#8220;That&#8217;s so. We&#8217;re looking to you, Councillor,
</p>
<p>and to the other leading citizens, to help us in up-
holding law and order in this township. Captain
Marvin is my name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d do better without you, Captain Marvin,&#8221;
said McGinty coldly; &#8220;for we have our own police
of the township, and no need for any imported
goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capi-
talists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer
fellow citizen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we won&#8217;t argue about that,&#8221; said
the police officer good-humouredly. &#8220;I expect we
all do our duty same as we see it; but we can&#8217;t
all see it the same.&#8221; He had drunk off his glass
and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the
face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his
elbow. &#8220;Hullo! Hullo!&#8221; he cried, looking him up
and down. &#8220;Here&#8217;s an old acquaintance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo shrank away from him. &#8220;I was never
a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my
life,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An acquaintance isn&#8217;t always a friend,&#8221; said
the police captain, grinning. &#8220;You&#8217;re Jack Mc-
Murdo of Chicago, right enough, and don&#8217;t you
deny it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
denying it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m ashamed of
my own name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got good cause to be, anyhow.&#8221;
&#8220;What the devil d&#8217;you mean by that?&#8221; he
</p>
<p>roared with his fists clenched.
&#8220;No, no, Jack, bluster won&#8217;t do with me. I was
</p>
<p>an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this
darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook
when I see one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo&#8217;s face fell. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that you&#8217;re
Marvin of the Chicago Central!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>714</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Lodge 341, Vermissa
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your ser-
vice. We haven&#8217;t forgotten the shooting of Jonas
Pinto up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never shot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not? That&#8217;s good impartial evidence,
ain&#8217;t it? Well, his death came in uncommon handy
for you, or they would have had you for shoving
the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for,
between you and me&#8212;and perhaps I&#8217;m going fur-
ther than my duty in saying it&#8212;they could get no
clear case against you, and Chicago&#8217;s open to you
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very well where I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve given you the pointer, and you&#8217;re a
sulky dog not to thank me for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank
you,&#8221; said McMurdo in no very gracious manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mum with me so long as I see you liv-
ing on the straight,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;But, by the
Lord! if you get off after this, it&#8217;s another story! So
good-night to you&#8212;and goodnight, Councillor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left the bar-room; but not before he had cre-
ated a local hero. McMurdo&#8217;s deeds in far Chicago
had been whispered before. He had put off all
questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to
have greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing
was officially confirmed. The bar loafers crowded
round him and shook him heartily by the hand.
He was free of the community from that time on.
He could drink hard and show little trace of it;
but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been
at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would
surely have spent his night under the bar.
</p>
<p>On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced
to the lodge. He had thought to pass in with-
out ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but
there were particular rites in Vermissa of which
they were proud, and these had to be undergone
by every postulant. The assembly met in a large
room reserved for such purposes at the Union
House. Some sixty members assembled at Ver-
missa; but that by no means represented the full
strength of the organization, for there were sev-
eral other lodges in the valley, and others across
the mountains on each side, who exchanged mem-
bers when any serious business was afoot, so that
a crime might be done by men who were strangers
to the locality. Altogether there were not less than
five hundred scattered over the coal district.
</p>
<p>In the bare assembly room the men were gath-
ered round a long table. At the side was a sec-
ond one laden with bottles and glasses, on which
</p>
<p>some members of the company were already turn-
ing their eyes. McGinty sat at the head with a flat
black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black
hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck,
so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over
some diabolical ritual. To right and left of him
were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, hand-
some face of Ted Baldwin among them. Each of
these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of
his office.
</p>
<p>They were, for the most part, men of mature
age; but the rest of the company consisted of
young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the
ready and capable agents who carried out the com-
mands of their seniors. Among the older men were
many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless
souls within; but looking at the rank and file it
was difficult to believe that these eager and open-
faced young fellows were in very truth a danger-
ous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered
such complete moral perversion that they took a
horrible pride in their proficiency at the business,
and looked with deepest respect at the man who
had the reputation of making what they called &#8220;a
clean job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To their contorted natures it had become a spir-
ited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service
against some man who had never injured them,
and whom in many cases they had never seen in
their lives. The crime committed, they quarrelled
as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and
amused one another and the company by describ-
ing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.
</p>
<p>At first they had shown some secrecy in their
arrangements; but at the time which this narra-
tive describes their proceedings were extraordinar-
ily open, for the repeated failures of the law had
proved to them that, on the one hand, no one
would dare to witness against them, and on the
other they had an unlimited number of stanch wit-
nesses upon whom they could call, and a well-
filled treasure chest from which they could draw
the funds to engage the best legal talent in the
state. In ten long years of outrage there had
been no single conviction, and the only danger
that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim
himself&#8212;who, however outnumbered and taken
by surprise, might and occasionally did leave his
mark upon his assailants.
</p>
<p>McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal
lay before him; but no one would tell him in what
it consisted. He was led now into an outer room by
two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition
he could hear the murmur of many voices from
</p>
<p>715</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the
sound of his own name, and he knew that they
were discussing his candidacy. Then there entered
an inner guard with a green and gold sash across
his chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bodymaster orders that he shall be
trussed, blinded, and entered,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>The three of them removed his coat, turned up
the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a
rope round above the elbows and made it fast.
They next placed a thick black cap right over his
head and the upper part of his face, so that he
could see nothing. He was then led into the as-
sembly hall.
</p>
<p>It was pitch dark and very oppressive under
his hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the
people round him, and then the voice of McGinty
sounded dull and distant through the covering of
his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;John McMurdo,&#8221; said the voice, &#8220;are you
already a member of the Ancient Order of
Freemen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed in assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your lodge No. 29, Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark nights are unpleasant,&#8221; said the voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for strangers to travel,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clouds are heavy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a storm is approaching.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the brethren satisfied?&#8221; asked the Body-
master.
</p>
<p>There was a general murmur of assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know, Brother, by your sign and by your
countersign that you are indeed one of us,&#8221; said
McGinty. &#8220;We would have you know, however,
that in this county and in other counties of these
parts we have certain rites, and also certain du-
ties of our own which call for good men. Are you
ready to be tested?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you of stout heart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a stride forward to prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the words were said he felt two hard points
in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it
appeared as if he could not move forward without
a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved
himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the
pressure melted away. There was a low murmur
of applause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is of stout heart,&#8221; said the voice. &#8220;Can you
bear pain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As well as another,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Test him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was all he could do to keep himself from
screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through
his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock
of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to
hide his agony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take more than that,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>This time there was loud applause. A finer
first appearance had never been made in the lodge.
Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was
plucked from his head. He stood blinking and
smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One last word, Brother McMurdo,&#8221; said
McGinty. &#8220;You have already sworn the oath of
secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the
punishment for any breach of it is instant and in-
evitable death?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for
the time being under all circumstances?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I
welcome you to its privileges and debates. You
will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan,
and we will drink to our worthy brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo&#8217;s coat had been brought to him; but
before putting it on he examined his right arm,
which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of
the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it,
deep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One
or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves
and showed their own lodge marks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all had it,&#8221; said one; &#8220;but not all as
brave as you over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! It was nothing,&#8221; said he; but it burned
and ached all the same.
</p>
<p>When the drinks which followed the ceremony
of initiation had all been disposed of, the business
of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed
only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, lis-
tened with open ears and more surprise than he
ventured to show to what followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first business on the agenda paper,&#8221; said
McGinty, &#8220;is to read the following letter from Divi-
sion Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249.
He says:
</p>
<p>716</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Lodge 341, Vermissa
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Sir:
&#8220;There is a job to be done on An-
</p>
<p>drew Rae of Rae &amp; Sturmash, coal own-
ers near this place. You will remem-
ber that your lodge owes us a return,
having had the service of two brethren
in the matter of the patrolman last fall.
You will send two good men, they will
be taken charge of by Treasurer Hig-
gins of this lodge, whose address you
know. He will show them when to act
and where. Yours in freedom,
</p>
<p>&#8220;J. W. Windle D. M. A. O. F.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Windle has never refused us when we have
had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two,
and it is not for us to refuse him.&#8221; McGinty paused
and looked round the room with his dull, malevo-
lent eyes. &#8220;Who will volunteer for the job?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Several young fellows held up their hands. The
Bodymaster looked at them with an approving
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as
well as you did the last, you won&#8217;t be wrong. And
you, Wilson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no pistol,&#8221; said the volunteer, a mere boy
in his teens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your first, is it not? Well, you have to be
blooded some time. It will be a great start for you.
As to the pistol, you&#8217;ll find it waiting for you, or
I&#8217;m mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday,
it will be time enough. You&#8217;ll get a great welcome
when you return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any reward this time?&#8221; asked Cormac, a
thick-set, dark-faced, brutal-looking young man,
whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of
&#8220;Tiger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the reward. You just do it for the
honour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there
will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has the man done?&#8221; asked young Wil-
son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s not for the likes of you to ask what
the man has done. He has been judged over there.
That&#8217;s no business of ours. All we have to do is
to carry it out for them, same as they would for
us. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Mer-
ton lodge are coming over to us next week to do
some business in this quarter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; asked someone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know noth-
ing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can
</p>
<p>come of it. But they are men who will make a
clean job when they are about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And time, too!&#8221; cried Ted Baldwin. &#8220;Folk are
gettin&#8217; out of hand in these parts. It was only last
week that three of our men were turned off by
Foreman Blaker. It&#8217;s been owing him a long time,
and he&#8217;ll get it full and proper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get what?&#8221; McMurdo whispered to his neigh-
bour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The business end of a buckshot cartridge!&#8221;
cried the man with a loud laugh. &#8220;What think you
of our ways, Brother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo&#8217;s criminal soul seemed to have al-
ready absorbed the spirit of the vile association of
which he was now a member. &#8220;I like it well,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Several of those who sat around heard his
words and applauded them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried the black-maned Body-
master from the end of the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways
to his taste.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. &#8220;I
would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man
should be wanted I should take it as an honour
to be chosen to help the lodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was great applause at this. It was felt that
a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon.
To some of the elders it seemed that the progress
was a little too rapid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would move,&#8221; said the secretary, Harraway,
a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the
chairman, &#8220;that Brother McMurdo should wait un-
til it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that was what I meant; I&#8217;m in your
hands,&#8221; said McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your time will come, Brother,&#8221; said the chair-
man. &#8220;We have marked you down as a willing
man, and we believe that you will do good work
in these parts. There is a small matter to-night in
which you may take a hand if it so please you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will wait for something that is worth while.&#8221;
&#8220;You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will
</p>
<p>help you to know what we stand for in this com-
munity. I will make the announcement later.
Meanwhile,&#8221; he glanced at his agenda paper, &#8220;I
have one or two more points to bring before the
meeting. First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to
our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Car-
naway&#8217;s widow. He was struck down doing the
work of the lodge, and it is for us to see that she is
not the loser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>717</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim was shot last month when they tried to
kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek,&#8221; McMurdo&#8217;s
neighbour informed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The funds are good at the moment,&#8221; said the
treasurer, with the bankbook in front of him. &#8220;The
firms have been generous of late. Max Linder &amp;
Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker
Brothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on my-
self to return it and ask for five. If I do not hear
by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of
order. We had to burn their breaker last year be-
fore they became reasonable. Then the West Sec-
tion Coaling Company has paid its annual contri-
bution. We have enough on hand to meet any obli-
gations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Archie Swindon?&#8221; asked a
brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has sold out and left the district. The old
devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be
a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large
mine owner under the power of a ring of black-
mailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a
break for it before the note reached us! I guess he
won&#8217;t show his face in this valley again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly
face and a good brow rose from the end of the ta-
ble which faced the chairman. &#8220;Mr. Treasurer,&#8221; he
asked, &#8220;may I ask who has bought the property of
this man that we have driven out of the district?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the
State &amp; Merton County Railroad Company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who bought the mines of Todman and of
Lee that came into the market in the same way last
year?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same company, Brother Morris.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who bought the ironworks of Manson
and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood,
which have all been given up of late?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were all bought by the West Gilmerton
General Mining Company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see, Brother Morris,&#8221; said the chair-
man, &#8220;that it matters to us who buys them, since
they can&#8217;t carry them out of the district.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster,
I think it may matter very much to us. This process
has been going on now for ten long years. We are
gradually driving all the small men out of trade.
What is the result? We find in their places great
companies like the Railroad or the General Iron,
who have their directors in New York or Philadel-
phia, and care nothing for our threats. We can
take it out of their local bosses, but it only means
</p>
<p>that others will be sent in their stead. And we are
making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men
could not harm us. They had not the money nor
the power. So long as we did not squeeze them
too dry, they would stay on under our power. But
if these big companies find that we stand between
them and their profits, they will spare no pains
and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to
court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a hush at these ominous words, and
every face darkened as gloomy looks were ex-
changed. So omnipotent and unchallenged had
they been that the very thought that there was pos-
sible retribution in the background had been ban-
ished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a
chill to the most reckless of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my advice,&#8221; the speaker continued, &#8220;that
we go easier upon the small men. On the day that
they have all been driven out the power of this so-
ciety will have been broken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Unwelcome truths are not popular. There
were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat.
McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Morris,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you were always
a croaker. So long as the members of this lodge
stand together there is no power in the United
States that can touch them. Sure, have we not
tried it often enough in the law courts? I expect
the big companies will find it easier to pay than
to fight, same as the little companies do. And
now, Brethren,&#8221; McGinty took off his black vel-
vet cap and his stole as he spoke, &#8220;this lodge has
finished its business for the evening, save for one
small matter which may be mentioned when we
are parting. The time has now come for fraternal
refreshment and for harmony.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Strange indeed is human nature. Here were
these men, to whom murder was familiar, who
again and again had struck down the father of the
family, some man against whom they had no per-
sonal feeling, without one thought of compunction
or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless
children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music
could move them to tears. McMurdo had a fine
tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good
will of the lodge before, it could no longer have
been withheld after he had thrilled them with &#8220;I&#8217;m
Sitting on the Stile, Mary,&#8221; and &#8220;On the Banks of
Allan Water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In his very first night the new recruit had made
himself one of the most popular of the brethren,
marked already for advancement and high office.
There were other qualities needed, however, be-
sides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy

<p>Freeman, and of these he was given an example
before the evening was over. The whisky bottle
had passed round many times, and the men were
flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymas-
ter rose once more to address them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there&#8217;s one man in this town
that wants trimming up, and it&#8217;s for you to see
that he gets it. I&#8217;m speaking of James Stanger of
the Herald. You&#8217;ve seen how he&#8217;s been opening his
mouth against us again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a murmur of assent, with many a
muttered oath. McGinty took a slip of paper from
his waistcoat pocket.
</p>
<p>Law and Order!
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how he heads it.
&#8220;Reign of terror in the coal and
</p>
<p>iron district
&#8220;Twelve years have now elapsed since the
first assassinations which proved the ex-
istence of a criminal organization in our
midst. From that day these outrages have
never ceased, until now they have reached
a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of
the civilized world. Is it for such results as
this that our great country welcomes to its
bosom the alien who flies from the despo-
tisms of Europe? Is it that they shall them-
selves become tyrants over the very men
who have given them shelter, and that a
state of terrorism and lawlessness should
be established under the very shadow of the
sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom
which would raise horror in our minds if
we read of it as existing under the most ef-
fete monarchy of the East? The men are
known. The organization is patent and
public. How long are we to endure it? Can
we forever live&#8212;
</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;ve read enough of the slush!&#8220; cried the
chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table.
&#8221;That&#8217;s what he says of us. The question I&#8217;m ask-
ing you is what shall we say to him?&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; cried a dozen fierce voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest against that,&#8221; said Brother Morris,
the man of the good brow and shaved face. &#8220;I tell
you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this
valley, and that there will come a point where in
self-defense every man will unite to crush us out.
James Stanger is an old man. He is respected in
the township and the district. His paper stands for
all that is solid in the valley. If that man is struck
down, there will be a stir through this state that
will only end with our destruction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how would they bring about our destruc-
tion, Mr. Standback?&#8221; cried McGinty. &#8220;Is it by the
police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and half
of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and
the judge? Haven&#8217;t we tried that before now, and
what ever came of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Judge Lynch that might try the
case,&#8221; said Brother Morris.
</p>
<p>A general shout of anger greeted the sugges-
tion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have but to raise my finger,&#8221; cried McGinty,
&#8220;and I could put two hundred men into this town
that would clear it out from end to end.&#8221; Then sud-
denly raising his voice and bending his huge black
brows into a terrible frown, &#8220;See here, Brother
Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for
some time! You&#8217;ve no heart yourself, and you try
to take the heart out of others. It will be an ill
day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name
comes on our agenda paper, and I&#8217;m thinking that
it&#8217;s just there that I ought to place it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees
seemed to give way under him as he fell back into
his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling hand
and drank before he could answer. &#8220;I apologize,
Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother
in this lodge if I have said more than I should. I
am a faithful member&#8212;you all know that&#8212;and it
is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes
me speak in anxious words. But I have greater
trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent
Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not of-
fend again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Bodymaster&#8217;s scowl relaxed as he listened
to the humble words. &#8220;Very good, Brother Morris.
It&#8217;s myself that would be sorry if it were needful to
give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair
we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed.
And now, boys,&#8221; he continued, looking round at
the company, &#8220;I&#8217;ll say this much, that if Stanger got
his full deserts there would be more trouble than
we need ask for. These editors hang together, and
every journal in the state would be crying out for
police and troops. But I guess you can give him
a pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother
Baldwin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said the young man eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many will you take?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a dozen, and two to guard the door.
You&#8217;ll come, Gower, and you, Mansel, and you,
Scanlan, and the two Willabys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised the new brother he should go,&#8221;
said the chairman.

</p>
<p>Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes
which showed that he had not forgotten nor for-
given. &#8220;Well, he can come if he wants,&#8221; he said in
a surly voice. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough. The sooner we get
to work the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The company broke up with shouts and yells
and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still
crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren
remained there. The little band who had been told
off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding
in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not
to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night,
with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty,
star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered
in a yard which faced a high building. The words
&#8220;Vermissa Herald&#8221; were printed in gold lettering
between the brightly lit windows. From within
came the clanking of the printin
