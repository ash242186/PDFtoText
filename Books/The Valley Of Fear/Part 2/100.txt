</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
The Man
</p>
<p>It was the fourth of February in the year 1875.
It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay
deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.
The steam ploughs had, however, kept the rail-
road open, and the evening train which connects
the long line of coal-mining and iron-working set-
tlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep
gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain
to Vermissa, the central township which lies at
the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point
the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing,
Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of
Merton. It was a single-track railroad; but at ev-
ery siding&#8212;and they were numerous&#8212;long lines
of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the
hidden wealth which had brought a rude popula-
tion and a bustling life to this most desolate corner
of the United States of America.
</p>
<p>For desolate it was! Little could the first pi-
oneer who had traversed it have ever imagined
that the fairest prairies and the most lush water
pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy
land of black crag and tangled forest. Above the
dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon
their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the moun-
tains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon
each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous val-
ley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly
crawling.
</p>
<p>The oil lamps had just been lit in the lead-
ing passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which
some twenty or thirty people were seated. The
greater number of these were workmen returning
from their day&#8217;s toil in the lower part of the val-
ley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and
the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed
themselves miners. These sat smoking in a group
and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally
at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose
uniforms and badges showed them to be police-
men.
</p>
<p>Several women of the labouring class and one
or two travellers who might have been small lo-
cal storekeepers made up the rest of the company,
with the exception of one young man in a corner
by himself. It is with this man that we are con-
cerned. Take a good look at him, for he is worth
it.
</p>
<p>He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized
young man, not far, one would guess, from his
thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous
</p>
<p>gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to
time as he looks round through his spectacles at
the people about him. It is easy to see that he is
of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anx-
ious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick
him at once as gregarious in his habits and com-
municative in his nature, with a quick wit and a
ready smile. And yet the man who studied him
more closely might discern a certain firmness of
jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would
warn him that there were depths beyond, and that
this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might
conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon
any society to which he was introduced.
</p>
<p>Having made one or two tentative remarks to
the nearest miner, and receiving only short, gruff
replies, the traveller resigned himself to unconge-
nial silence, staring moodily out of the window at
the fading landscape.
</p>
<p>It was not a cheering prospect. Through the
growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the
furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps
of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each
side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering
above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden
houses, the windows of which were beginning to
outline themselves in light, were scattered here
and there along the line, and the frequent halt-
ing places were crowded with their swarthy inhab-
itants.
</p>
<p>The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa dis-
trict were no resorts for the leisured or the cul-
tured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the
crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done,
and the rude, strong workers who did it.
</p>
<p>The young traveller gazed out into this dismal
country with a face of mingled repulsion and inter-
est, which showed that the scene was new to him.
At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter
to which he referred, and on the margins of which
he scribbled some notes. Once from the back of
his waist he produced something which one would
hardly have expected to find in the possession of
so mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver
of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to
the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper
shells within the drum showed that it was fully
loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket,
but not before it had been observed by a working
man who had seated himself upon the adjoining
bench.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, mate!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You seem heeled and
ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man smiled with an air of embar-
rassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we need them sometimes in the
place I come from.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where may that be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m last from Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A stranger in these parts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may find you need it here,&#8221; said the work-
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! is that so?&#8221; The young man seemed inter-
ested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard nothing of doings here-
abouts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing out of the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought the country was full of it.
You&#8217;ll hear quick enough. What made you come
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard there was always work for a willing
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a member of the union?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll get your job, I guess. Have you
any friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet; but I have the means of making
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen.
There&#8217;s no town without a lodge, and where there
is a lodge I&#8217;ll find my friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The remark had a singular effect upon his com-
panion. He glanced round suspiciously at the oth-
ers in the car. The miners were still whispering
among themselves. The two police officers were
dozing. He came across, seated himself close to
the young traveller, and held out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it there,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>A hand-grip passed between the two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you speak the truth,&#8221; said the workman.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s well to make certain.&#8221; He raised his right
hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller at once
raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark nights are unpleasant,&#8221; said the work-
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for strangers to travel,&#8221; the other an-
swered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good enough. I&#8217;m Brother Scanlan,
Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. Glad to see you in
these parts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;m Brother John McMurdo,
Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J. H. Scott. But
I am in luck to meet a brother so early.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there are plenty of us about. You won&#8217;t
find the order more flourishing anywhere in the
States than right here in Vermissa Valley. But we
could do with some lads like you. I can&#8217;t under-
stand a spry man of the union finding no work to
do in Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found plenty of work to do,&#8221; said McMurdo.
&#8220;Then why did you leave?&#8221;
McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and
</p>
<p>smiled. &#8220;I guess those chaps would be glad to
know,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Scanlan groaned sympathetically. &#8220;In trouble?&#8221;
he asked in a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deep.&#8221;
&#8220;A penitentiary job?&#8221;
&#8220;And the rest.&#8221;
&#8220;Not a killing!&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s early days to talk of such things,&#8221; said Mc-
</p>
<p>Murdo with the air of a man who had been sur-
prised into saying more than he intended. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
my own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let
that be enough for you. Who are you that you
should take it on yourself to ask such things?&#8221;
His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and danger-
ous anger from behind his glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mate, no offense meant. The boys
will think none the worse of you, whatever you
may have done. Where are you bound for now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vermissa.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s the third halt down the line. Where are
</p>
<p>you staying?&#8221;
McMurdo took out an envelope and held it
</p>
<p>close to the murky oil lamp. &#8220;Here is the ad-
dress&#8212;Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It&#8217;s a board-
ing house that was recommended by a man I knew
in Chicago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know it; but Vermissa is out of
my beat. I live at Hobson&#8217;s Patch, and that&#8217;s here
where we are drawing up. But, say, there&#8217;s one
bit of advice I&#8217;ll give you before we part: If you&#8217;re
in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union
House and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymas-
ter of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen
in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it.
So long, mate! Maybe we&#8217;ll meet in lodge one of
these evenings. But mind my words: If you are in
trouble, go to Boss McGinty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>704</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Man
</p>
<p>Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left
once again to his thoughts. Night had now fallen,
and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roar-
ing and leaping in the darkness. Against their
lurid background dark figures were bending and
straining, twisting and turning, with the motion of
winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal
clank and roar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess hell must look something like that,&#8221;
said a voice.
</p>
<p>McMurdo turned and saw that one of the po-
licemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out
into the fiery waste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For that matter,&#8221; said the other policeman, &#8220;I
allow that hell must be something like that. If there
are worse devils down yonder than some we could
name, it&#8217;s more than I&#8217;d expect. I guess you are
new to this part, young man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what if I am?&#8221; McMurdo answered in a
surly voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this, mister, that I should advise you to
be careful in choosing your friends. I don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;d begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell is it to you who are my friends?&#8221;
roared McMurdo in a voice which brought every
head in the carriage round to witness the alterca-
tion. &#8220;Did I ask you for your advice, or did you
think me such a sucker that I couldn&#8217;t move with-
out it? You speak when you are spoken to, and
by the Lord you&#8217;d have to wait a long time if it
was me!&#8221; He thrust out his face and grinned at the
patrolmen like a snarling dog.
</p>
<p>The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men,
were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence
with which their friendly advances had been re-
jected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No offense, stranger,&#8221; said one. &#8220;It was a
warning for your own good, seeing that you are,
by your own showing, new to the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m new to the place; but I&#8217;m not new to you
and your kind!&#8221; cried McMurdo in cold fury. &#8220;I
guess you&#8217;re the same in all places, shoving your
advice in when nobody asks for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll see more of you before very
long,&#8221; said one of the patrolmen with a grin.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking the same,&#8221; remarked the other.
&#8220;I guess we may meet again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of you, and don&#8217;t you think
it!&#8221; cried McMurdo. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Jack Mc-
Murdo&#8212;see? If you want me, you&#8217;ll find me at Ja-
cob Shafter&#8217;s on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I&#8217;m
</p>
<p>not hiding from you, am I? Day or night I dare to
look the like of you in the face&#8212;don&#8217;t make any
mistake about that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a murmur of sympathy and ad-
miration from the miners at the dauntless de-
meanour of the newcomer, while the two police-
men shrugged their shoulders and renewed a con-
versation between themselves.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-
lit station, and there was a general clearing; for
Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line.
McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was
about to start off into the darkness, when one of
the miners accosted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the
cops,&#8221; he said in a voice of awe. &#8220;It was grand to
hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you
the road. I&#8217;m passing Shafter&#8217;s on the way to my
own shack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a chorus of friendly &#8220;Good-nights&#8221;
from the other miners as they passed from the plat-
form. Before ever he had set foot in it, McMurdo
the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.
</p>
<p>The country had been a place of terror; but the
town was in its way even more depressing. Down
that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy
grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drift-
ing smoke, while the strength and industry of man
found fitting monuments in the hills which he had
spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations.
But the town showed a dead level of mean ugli-
ness and squalor. The broad street was churned
up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of
muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and
uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to
show more clearly a long line of wooden houses,
each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt
and dirty.
</p>
<p>As they approached the centre of the town the
scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores,
and even more by a cluster of saloons and gam-
ing houses, in which the miners spent their hard-
earned but generous wages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Union House,&#8221; said the guide,
pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the
dignity of being a hotel. &#8220;Jack McGinty is the boss
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a man is he?&#8221; McMurdo asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! have you never heard of the boss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I have heard of him when you
know that I am a stranger in these parts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>705</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought his name was known clear
across the country. It&#8217;s been in the papers often
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;
&#8220;Well,&#8221; the miner lowered his voice&#8212;&#8220;over the
</p>
<p>affairs.&#8221;
&#8220;What affairs?&#8221;
&#8220;Good Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must
</p>
<p>say it without offense. There&#8217;s only one set of af-
fairs that you&#8217;ll hear of in these parts, and that&#8217;s
the affairs of the Scowrers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in
Chicago. A gang of murderers, are they not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, on your life!&#8221; cried the miner, standing
still in alarm, and gazing in amazement at his com-
panion. &#8220;Man, you won&#8217;t live long in these parts
if you speak in the open street like that. Many a
man has had the life beaten out of him for less.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know nothing about them. It&#8217;s only
what I have read.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not saying that you have not read the
truth.&#8221; The man looked nervously round him as
he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he feared
to see some lurking danger. &#8220;If killing is mur-
der, then God knows there is murder and to spare.
But don&#8217;t you dare to breathe the name of Jack
McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every
whisper goes back to him, and he is not one that
is likely to let it pass. Now, that&#8217;s the house you&#8217;re
after, that one standing back from the street. You&#8217;ll
find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man
as lives in this township.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said McMurdo, and shaking
hands with his new acquaintance he plodded,
gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the
dwelling house, at the door of which he gave a
resounding knock.
</p>
<p>It was opened at once by someone very differ-
ent from what he had expected. It was a woman,
young and singularly beautiful. She was of the
German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the pi-
quant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with
which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and
a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave
</p>
<p>of colour over her pale face. Framed in the bright
light of the open doorway, it seemed to McMurdo
that he had never seen a more beautiful picture;
the more attractive for its contrast with the sor-
did and gloomy surroundings. A lovely violet
growing upon one of those black slag-heaps of the
mines would not have seemed more surprising. So
entranced was he that he stood staring without a
word, and it was she who broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was father,&#8221; said she with a pleas-
ing little touch of a German accent. &#8220;Did you come
to see him? He is downtown. I expect him back
every minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open ad-
miration until her eyes dropped in confusion be-
fore this masterful visitor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, miss,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I&#8217;m in no hurry to
see him. But your house was recommended to me
for board. I thought it might suit me&#8212;and now I
know it will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quick to make up your mind,&#8221; said
she with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone but a blind man could do as much,&#8221;
the other answered.
</p>
<p>She laughed at the compliment. &#8220;Come right
in, sir,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr.
Shafter&#8217;s daughter. My mother&#8217;s dead, and I run
the house. You can sit down by the stove in the
front room until father comes along&#8212;Ah, here he
is! So you can fix things with him right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the
path. In a few words McMurdo explained his busi-
ness. A man of the name of Murphy had given him
the address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from
someone else. Old Shafter was quite ready. The
stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at
once to every condition, and was apparently fairly
flush of money. For seven dollars a week paid in
advance he was to have board and lodging.
</p>
<p>So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed
fugitive from justice, took up his abode under the
roof of the Shafters, the first step which was to lead
to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a
far distant land.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Bodymaster
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
The Bodymaster
</p>
<p>McMurdo was a man who made his mark
quickly. Wherever he was the folk around soon
knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely
the most important person at Shafter&#8217;s. There
were ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were
honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the
stores, of a very different calibre from the young
Irishman. Of an evening when they gathered to-
gether his joke was always the readiest, his con-
versation the brightest, and his song the best. He
was a born boon companion, with a magnetism
which drew good humour from all around him.
</p>
<p>And yet he showed again and again, as he had
shown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sud-
den, fierce anger, which compelled the respect and
even the fear of those who met him. For the law,
too, and all who were connected with it, he exhib-
ited a bitter contempt which delighted some and
alarmed others of his fellow boarders.
</p>
<p>From the first he made it evident, by his open
admiration, that the daughter of the house had
won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes
upon her beauty and her grace. He was no back-
ward suitor. On the second day he told her that he
loved her, and from then onward he repeated the
same story with an absolute disregard of what she
might say to discourage him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone else?&#8221; he would cry. &#8220;Well, the
worse luck for someone else! Let him look out for
himself! Am I to lose my life&#8217;s chance and all my
heart&#8217;s desire for someone else? You can keep on
saying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will
say yes, and I&#8217;m young enough to wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish
tongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was
about him also that glamour of experience and of
mystery which attracts a woman&#8217;s interest, and fi-
nally her love. He could talk of the sweet val-
leys of County Monaghan from which he came,
of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and
green meadows of which seemed the more beauti-
ful when imagination viewed them from this place
of grime and snow.
</p>
<p>Then he was versed in the life of the cities
of the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps
of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he
had worked in a planing mill. And afterwards
came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange
things had happened to him in that great city, so
strange and so intimate that they might not be
</p>
<p>spoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leav-
ing, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a strange
world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie lis-
tened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with
sympathy&#8212;those two qualities which may turn so
rapidly and so naturally to love.
</p>
<p>McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as
bookkeeper; for he was a well-educated man. This
kept him out most of the day, and he had not
found occasion yet to report himself to the head
of the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen.
He was reminded of his omission, however, by a
visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow
member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan,
the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man,
seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass
or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit.
</p>
