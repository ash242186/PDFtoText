</p>
<p>Needless to say that they were discharged with
something very near to an apology from the bench
for the inconvenience to which they had been put,
together with an implied censure of Captain Mar-
vin and the police for their officious zeal.
</p>
<p>The verdict was greeted with loud applause
by a court in which McMurdo saw many famil-
iar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved.
</p>
<p>But there were others who sat with compressed
lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the
dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute
fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades
into words as the ex-prisoners passed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned murderers!&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll fix
you yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
The Darkest Hour
</p>
<p>If anything had been needed to give an impetus
to Jack McMurdo&#8217;s popularity among his fellows
it would have been his arrest and acquittal. That a
man on the very night of joining the lodge should
have done something which brought him before
the magistrate was a new record in the annals of
the society. Already he had earned the reputation
of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and
withal a man of high temper, who would not take
an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself.
But in addition to this he impressed his comrades
with the idea that among them all there was not
one whose brain was so ready to devise a blood-
thirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more ca-
pable of carrying it out. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be the boy for the
clean job,&#8221; said the oldsters to one another, and
waited their time until they could set him to his
work.
</p>
<p>McGinty had instruments enough already; but
he recognized that this was a supremely able one.
He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in
leash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but
some day he would slip this creature upon its prey.
A few members of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among
them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and
hated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for he
was as ready to fight as to laugh.
</p>
<p>But if he gained favour with his fellows, there
was another quarter, one which had become even
more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie
Shafter&#8217;s father would have nothing more to do
with him, nor would he allow him to enter the
house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give
him up altogether, and yet her own good sense
warned her of what would come from a marriage
</p>
<p>with a man who was regarded as a criminal.
</p>
<p>One morning after a sleepless night she de-
termined to see him, possibly for the last time,
and make one strong endeavour to draw him
from those evil influences which were sucking him
down. She went to his house, as he had often
begged her to do, and made her way into the room
which he used as his sitting-room. He was seated
at a table, with his back turned and a letter in front
of him. A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came
over her&#8212;she was still only nineteen. He had not
heard her when she pushed open the door. Now
she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon
his bended shoulders.
</p>
<p>If she had expected to startle him, she certainly
succeeded; but only in turn to be startled her-
self. With a tiger spring he turned on her, and
his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the
same instant with the other hand he crumpled up
the paper that lay before him. For an instant he
stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took
the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his
features&#8212;a ferocity which had sent her shrinking
back in horror as from something which had never
before intruded into her gentle life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you!&#8221; said he, mopping his brow. &#8220;And
to think that you should come to me, heart of my
heart, and I should find nothing better to do than
to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,&#8221; and
he held out his arms, &#8220;let me make it up to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she had not recovered from that sudden
glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the
man&#8217;s face. All her woman&#8217;s instinct told her that
it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled.
Guilt&#8212;that was it&#8212;guilt and fear!
</p>
<p>725</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you, Jack?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why
were you so scared of me? Oh, Jack, if your con-
science was at ease, you would not have looked at
me like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I was thinking of other things, and when
you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of
yours&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it was more than that, Jack.&#8221; Then a
sudden suspicion seized her. &#8220;Let me see that let-
ter you were writing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Ettie, I couldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
Her suspicions became certainties. &#8220;It&#8217;s to an-
</p>
<p>other woman,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I know it! Why else
should you hold it from me? Was it to your wife
that you were writing? How am I to know that
you are not a married man&#8212;you, a stranger, that
nobody knows?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it!
You&#8217;re the only one woman on earth to me. By the
cross of Christ I swear it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was so white with passionate earnestness
that she could not but believe him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;why will you not show
me the letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, acushla,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m under oath
not to show it, and just as I wouldn&#8217;t break my
word to you so I would keep it to those who hold
my promise. It&#8217;s the business of the lodge, and
even to you it&#8217;s secret. And if I was scared when
a hand fell on me, can&#8217;t you understand it when it
might have been the hand of a detective?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt that he was telling the truth. He gath-
ered her into his arms and kissed away her fears
and doubts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit here by me, then. It&#8217;s a queer throne for
such a queen; but it&#8217;s the best your poor lover can
find. He&#8217;ll do better for you some of these days,
I&#8217;m thinking. Now your mind is easy once again,
is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know
that you are a criminal among criminals, when I
never know the day that I may hear you are in
court for murder? &#8216;McMurdo the Scowrer,&#8217; that&#8217;s
what one of our boarders called you yesterday. It
went through my heart like a knife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, hard words break no bones.&#8221;
&#8220;But they were true.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, dear, it&#8217;s not so bad as you think. We are
</p>
<p>but poor men that are trying in our own way to
get our rights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ettie threw her arms round her lover&#8217;s neck.
&#8220;Give it up, Jack! For my sake, for God&#8217;s sake,
</p>
<p>give it up! It was to ask you that I came here to-
day. Oh, Jack, see&#8212;I beg it of you on my bended
knees! Kneeling here before you I implore you to
give it up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He raised her and soothed her with her head
against his breast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, my darlin&#8217;, you don&#8217;t know what it is
you are asking. How could I give it up when it
would be to break my oath and to desert my com-
rades? If you could see how things stand with me
you could never ask it of me. Besides, if I wanted
to, how could I do it? You don&#8217;t suppose that the
lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, Jack. I&#8217;ve planned it all.
Father has saved some money. He is weary of this
place where the fear of these people darkens our
lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together
to Philadelphia or New York, where we would be
safe from them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo laughed. &#8220;The lodge has a long arm.
Do you think it could not stretch from here to
Philadelphia or New York?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, to the West, or to England, or to
Germany, where father came from&#8212;anywhere to
get away from this Valley of Fear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris.
&#8220;Sure, it is the second time I have heard the val-
ley so named,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The shadow does indeed
seem to lie heavy on some of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It darkens every moment of our lives. Do you
suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us? If
it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose
our chances would be? If you saw the look in those
dark, hungry eyes of his when they fall on me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gar! I&#8217;d teach him better manners if I
caught him at it! But see here, little girl. I can&#8217;t
leave here. I can&#8217;t&#8212;take that from me once and for
all. But if you will leave me to find my own way,
I will try to prepare a way of getting honourably
out of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no honour in such a matter.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, well, it&#8217;s just how you look at it. But if
</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll give me six months, I&#8217;ll work it so that I can
leave without being ashamed to look others in the
face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl laughed with joy. &#8220;Six months!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Is it a promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it may be seven or eight. But within a
year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet
it was something. There was this distant light to
illuminate the gloom of the immediate future. She
</p>
<p>726</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Darkest Hour
</p>
<p>returned to her father&#8217;s house more light-hearted
than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had
come into her life.
</p>
<p>It might be thought that as a member, all
the doings of the society would be told to him;
but he was soon to discover that the organiza-
tion was wider and more complex than the sim-
ple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to
many things; for there was an official named the
County Delegate, living at Hobson&#8217;s Patch farther
down the line, who had power over several dif-
ferent lodges which he wielded in a sudden and
arbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a
sly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a slinking
gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with
malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the
great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something
of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton
may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robe-
spierre.
</p>
<p>One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo&#8217;s fel-
low boarder, received a note from McGinty in-
closing one from Evans Pott, which informed him
that he was sending over two good men, Lawler
and Andrews, who had instructions to act in the
neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause
that no particulars as to their objects should be
given. Would the Bodymaster see to it that suit-
able arrangements be made for their lodgings and
comfort until the time for action should arrive?
McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone
to remain secret at the Union House, and that,
therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and
Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days
in their boarding house.
</p>
<p>The same evening the two men arrived, each
carrying his gripsack. Lawler was an elderly man,
shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old
black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and
ragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resem-
blance to an itinerant preacher. His companion
Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced
and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who
is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every
minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and
behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the
society, with the one simple exception that they
were assassins who had often proved themselves
to be most capable instruments for this association
of murder. Lawler had already carried out four-
teen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three.
</p>
<p>They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to
converse about their deeds in the past, which they
recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who
</p>
<p>had done good and unselfish service for the com-
munity. They were reticent, however, as to the im-
mediate job in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They chose us because neither I nor the boy
here drink,&#8221; Lawler explained. &#8220;They can count
on us saying no more than we should. You must
not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County
Delegate that we obey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, we are all in it together,&#8221; said Scanlan,
McMurdo&#8217;s mate, as the four sat together at sup-
per.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough, and we&#8217;ll talk till the cows
come home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of
Simon Bird, or any other job in the past. But till
the work is done we say nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are half a dozen about here that I have
a word to say to,&#8221; said McMurdo, with an oath. &#8220;I
suppose it isn&#8217;t Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are
after. I&#8217;d go some way to see him get his deserts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not him yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Herman Strauss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nor him either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you won&#8217;t tell us we can&#8217;t make you;
but I&#8217;d be glad to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lawler smiled and shook his head. He was not
to be drawn.
</p>
<p>In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scan-
lan and McMurdo were quite determined to be
present at what they called &#8220;the fun.&#8221; When, there-
fore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo
heard them creeping down the stairs he awak-
ened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes.
When they were dressed they found that the oth-
ers had stolen out, leaving the door open behind
them. It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the
lamps they could see the two men some distance
down the street. They followed them warily, tread-
ing noiselessly in the deep snow.
</p>
<p>The boarding house was near the edge of the
town, and soon they were at the crossroads which
is beyond its boundary. Here three men were
waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a
short, eager conversation. Then they all moved on
together. It was clearly some notable job which
needed numbers. At this point there are several
trails which lead to various mines. The strangers
took that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge busi-
ness which was in strong hands which had been
able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New
England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some
order and discipline during the long reign of ter-
ror.
</p>
<p>727</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>Day was breaking now, and a line of work-
men were slowly making their way, singly and in
groups, along the blackened path.
</p>
<p>McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the oth-
ers, keeping in sight of the men whom they fol-
lowed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the
heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam
whistle. It was the ten-minute signal before the
cages descended and the day&#8217;s labour began.
</p>
<p>When they reached the open space round the
mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting,
stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers;
for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a
little group under the shadow of the engine house.
Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from
which the whole scene lay before them. They
saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman
named Menzies, come out of the engine house and
blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.
</p>
<p>At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young
man with a clean-shaved, earnest face advanced
eagerly towards the pit head. As he came for-
ward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and mo-
tionless, under the engine house. The men had
drawn down their hats and turned up their collars
to screen their faces. For a moment the presenti-
ment of Death laid its cold hand upon the man-
ager&#8217;s heart. At the next he had shaken it off and
saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked as he advanced.
&#8220;What are you loitering there for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no answer; but the lad Andrews
stepped forward and shot him in the stomach. The
hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and
helpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager
clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled
himself up. Then he staggered away; but another
of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise,
kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers.
Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the
sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the mur-
derers; but was met by two balls in the face which
dropped him dead at their very feet.
</p>
<p>There was a surge forward of some of the min-
ers, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger;
but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-
shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they
broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly
back to their homes in Vermissa.
</p>
<p>When a few of the bravest had rallied, and
there was a return to the mine, the murderous
gang had vanished in the mists of morning, with-
out a single witness being able to swear to the
</p>
<p>identity of these men who in front of a hundred
spectators had wrought this double crime.
</p>
<p>Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back;
Scanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the first
murder job that he had seen with his own eyes,
and it appeared less funny than he had been led
to believe. The horrible screams of the dead man-
ager&#8217;s wife pursued them as they hurried to the
town. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but
he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it is like a war,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What is it
but a war between us and them, and we hit back
where we best can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was high revel in the lodge room at the
Union House that night, not only over the killing
of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill
mine, which would bring this organization into
line with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken
companies of the district, but also over a distant
triumph which had been wrought by the hands of
the lodge itself.
</p>
<p>It would appear that when the County Dele-
gate had sent over five good men to strike a blow
in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three
Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent
across to kill William Hales of Stake Royal, one
of the best known and most popular mine owners
in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed
not to have an enemy in the world; for he was in all
ways a model employer. He had insisted, however,
upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore,
paid off certain drunken and idle employees who
were members of the all-powerful society. Coffin
notices hung outside his door had not weakened
his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country
he found himself condemned to death.
</p>
<p>The execution had now been duly carried out.
Ted Baldwin, who sprawled now in the seat of
honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of
the party. His flushed face and glazed, blood-shot
eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his
two comrades had spent the night before among
the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-
stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn
hope, could have had a warmer welcome from
their comrades.
</p>
<p>The story was told and retold amid cries of de-
light and shouts of laughter. They had waited for
their man as he drove home at nightfall, taking
their station at the top of a steep hill, where his
horse must be at a walk. He was so furred to
keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand
on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot
</p>
<p>728</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Darkest Hour
</p>
<p>him again and again. He had screamed for mercy.
The screams were repeated for the amusement of
the lodge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear again how he squealed,&#8221; they cried.
None of them knew the man; but there is eter-
</p>
<p>nal drama in a killing, and they had shown the
Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were
to be relied upon.
</p>
<p>There had been one contretemps; for a man and
his wife had driven up while they were still empty-
ing their revolvers into the silent body. It had been
suggested that they should shoot them both; but
they were harmless folk who were not connected
with the mines, so they were sternly bidden to
drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall
them. And so the blood-mottled figure had been
left as a warning to all such hard-hearted employ-
ers, and the three noble avengers had hurried off
into the mountains where unbroken nature comes
down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag
heaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work
well done, and the plaudits of their companions in
their ears.
</p>
<p>It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The
shadow had fallen even darker over the valley. But
as the wise general chooses the moment of victory
in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes
may have no time to steady themselves after dis-
aster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene
of his operations with his brooding and malicious
eyes, had devised a new attack upon those who
opposed him. That very night, as the half-drunken
company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the
arm and led him aside into that inner room where
they had their first interview.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my lad,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a job
that&#8217;s worthy of you at last. You&#8217;ll have the do-
ing of it in your own hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Proud I am to hear it,&#8221; McMurdo answered.
&#8220;You can take two men with you&#8212;Manders
</p>
<p>and Reilly. They have been warned for service.
We&#8217;ll never be right in this district until Chester
Wilcox has been settled, and you&#8217;ll have the thanks
of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, anyhow. Who is he, and where
shall I find him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-
smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth, and
proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn
from his notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Com-
pany. He&#8217;s a hard citizen, an old colour sergeant of
</p>
<p>the war, all scars and grizzle. We&#8217;ve had two tries
at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his
life over it. Now it&#8217;s for you to take it over. That&#8217;s
the house&#8212;all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad,
same as you see here on the map&#8212;without another
within earshot. It&#8217;s no good by day. He&#8217;s armed
and shoots quick and straight, with no questions
asked. But at night&#8212;well, there he is with his wife,
three children, and a hired help. You can&#8217;t pick or
choose. It&#8217;s all or none. If you could get a bag
of blasting powder at the front door with a slow
match to it&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the man done?&#8221;
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?&#8221;
&#8220;Why did he shoot him?&#8221;
&#8220;What in thunder has that to do with you? Car-
</p>
<p>naway was about his house at night, and he shot
him. That&#8217;s enough for me and you. You&#8217;ve got to
settle the thing right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220
