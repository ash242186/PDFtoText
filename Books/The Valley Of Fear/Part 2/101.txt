</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
The Bodymaster
</p>
<p>McMurdo was a man who made his mark
quickly. Wherever he was the folk around soon
knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely
the most important person at Shafter&#8217;s. There
were ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were
honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the
stores, of a very different calibre from the young
Irishman. Of an evening when they gathered to-
gether his joke was always the readiest, his con-
versation the brightest, and his song the best. He
was a born boon companion, with a magnetism
which drew good humour from all around him.
</p>
<p>And yet he showed again and again, as he had
shown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sud-
den, fierce anger, which compelled the respect and
even the fear of those who met him. For the law,
too, and all who were connected with it, he exhib-
ited a bitter contempt which delighted some and
alarmed others of his fellow boarders.
</p>
<p>From the first he made it evident, by his open
admiration, that the daughter of the house had
won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes
upon her beauty and her grace. He was no back-
ward suitor. On the second day he told her that he
loved her, and from then onward he repeated the
same story with an absolute disregard of what she
might say to discourage him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone else?&#8221; he would cry. &#8220;Well, the
worse luck for someone else! Let him look out for
himself! Am I to lose my life&#8217;s chance and all my
heart&#8217;s desire for someone else? You can keep on
saying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will
say yes, and I&#8217;m young enough to wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish
tongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was
about him also that glamour of experience and of
mystery which attracts a woman&#8217;s interest, and fi-
nally her love. He could talk of the sweet val-
leys of County Monaghan from which he came,
of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and
green meadows of which seemed the more beauti-
ful when imagination viewed them from this place
of grime and snow.
</p>
<p>Then he was versed in the life of the cities
of the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps
of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he
had worked in a planing mill. And afterwards
came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange
things had happened to him in that great city, so
strange and so intimate that they might not be
</p>
<p>spoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leav-
ing, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a strange
world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie lis-
tened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with
sympathy&#8212;those two qualities which may turn so
rapidly and so naturally to love.
</p>
<p>McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as
bookkeeper; for he was a well-educated man. This
kept him out most of the day, and he had not
found occasion yet to report himself to the head
of the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen.
He was reminded of his omission, however, by a
visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow
member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan,
the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man,
seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass
or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, McMurdo,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I remembered your
address, so l made bold to call. I&#8217;m surprised
that you&#8217;ve not reported to the Bodymaster. Why
haven&#8217;t you seen Boss McGinty yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had to find a job. I have been busy.&#8221;
&#8220;You must find time for him if you have none
</p>
<p>for anything else. Good Lord, man! you&#8217;re a fool
not to have been down to the Union House and
registered your name the first morning after you
came here! If you run against him&#8212;well, you
mustn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo showed mild surprise. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a
member of the lodge for over two years, Scanlan,
but I never heard that duties were so pressing as
all that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not in Chicago.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s the same society here.&#8221;
&#8220;Is it?&#8221;
Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There
</p>
<p>was something sinister in his eyes.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;ll tell me that in a month&#8217;s time. I hear
</p>
<p>you had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, it got about&#8212;things do get about for good
</p>
<p>and for bad in this district.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of
</p>
<p>them.&#8221;
&#8220;By the Lord, you&#8217;ll be a man after McGinty&#8217;s
</p>
<p>heart!&#8221;
&#8220;What, does he hate the police too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>707</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>Scanlan burst out laughing. &#8220;You go and see
him, my lad,&#8221; said he as he took his leave. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not the police but you that he&#8217;ll hate if you don&#8217;t!
Now, take a friend&#8217;s advice and go at once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo
had another more pressing interview which urged
him in the same direction. It may have been that
his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than
before, or that they had gradually obtruded them-
selves into the slow mind of his good German
host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house
keeper beckoned the young man into his private
room and started on the subject without any cir-
cumlocution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me, mister,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you
are gettin&#8217; set on my Ettie. Ain&#8217;t that so, or am
I wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is so,&#8221; the young man answered.
&#8220;Vell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain&#8217;t no
</p>
<p>manner of use. There&#8217;s someone slipped in afore
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me so.&#8221;
&#8220;Vell, you can lay that she told you truth. But
</p>
<p>did she tell you who it vas?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I asked her; but she wouldn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;
&#8220;I dare say not, the leetle baggage! Perhaps she
</p>
<p>did not vish to frighten you avay.&#8221;
&#8220;Frighten!&#8221; McMurdo was on fire in a moment.
&#8220;Ah, yes, my friend! You need not be ashamed
</p>
<p>to be frightened of him. It is Teddy Baldwin.&#8221;
&#8220;And who the devil is he?&#8221;
&#8220;He is a boss of Scowrers.&#8221;
&#8220;Scowrers! I&#8217;ve heard of them before. It&#8217;s
</p>
<p>Scowrers here and Scowrers there, and always in a
whisper! What are you all afraid of? Who are the
Scowrers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boarding-house keeper instinctively sank
his voice, as everyone did who talked about that
terrible society. &#8220;The Scowrers,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are the
Eminent Order of Freemen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man stared. &#8220;Why, I am a member
of that order myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You! I vould never have had you in my house
if I had known it&#8212;not if you vere to pay me a hun-
dred dollar a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with the order? It&#8217;s for charity
and good fellowship. The rules say so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe in some places. Not here!&#8221;
&#8220;What is it here?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a murder society, that&#8217;s vat it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo laughed incredulously. &#8220;How can
you prove that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove it! Are there not fifty murders to prove
it? Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the
Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little
Billy James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a
man or a voman in this valley vat does not know
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; said McMurdo earnestly. &#8220;I want
you to take back what you&#8217;ve said, or else make
it good. One or the other you must do before I
quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here
am I, a stranger in the town. I belong to a society
that I know only as an innocent one. You&#8217;ll find it
through the length and breadth of the States, but
always as an innocent one. Now, when I am count-
ing upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the
same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I
guess you owe me either an apology or else an ex-
planation, Mr. Shafter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows,
mister. The bosses of the one are the bosses of the
other. If you offend the one, it is the other vat vill
strike you. We have proved it too often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just gossip&#8212;I want proof!&#8221; said Mc-
Murdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you live here long you vill get your proof.
But I forget that you are yourself one of them.
You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you vill
find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you
here. Is it not bad enough that one of these people
come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn
him down, but that I should have another for my
boarder? Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after
to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo found himself under sentence of
banishment both from his comfortable quarters
and from the girl whom he loved. He found her
alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and
he poured his troubles into her ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, your father is after giving me notice,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s little I would care if it was just my room,
but indeed, Ettie, though it&#8217;s only a week that I&#8217;ve
known you, you are the very breath of life to me,
and I can&#8217;t live without you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don&#8217;t speak so!&#8221;
said the girl. &#8220;I have told you, have I not, that
you are too late? There is another, and if I have
not promised to marry him at once, at least I can
promise no one else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have
had a chance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl sank her face into her hands. &#8220;I wish
to heaven that you had been first!&#8221; she sobbed.
</p>
<p>708</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Bodymaster
</p>
<p>McMurdo was down on his knees before her
in an instant. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Ettie, let it stand
at that!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Will you ruin your life and
my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your
heart, acushla! &#8217;Tis a safer guide than any promise
before you knew what it was that you were say-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had seized Ettie&#8217;s white hand between his
own strong brown ones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say that you will be mine, and we will face it
out together!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Jack!&#8221; His arms were round her now.
&#8220;It could not be here. Could you take me away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A struggle passed for a moment over Mc-
Murdo&#8217;s face; but it ended by setting like gran-
ite. &#8220;No, here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold you against the
world, Ettie, right here where we are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we not leave together?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Ettie, I can&#8217;t leave here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never hold my head up again if I felt that
I had been driven out. Besides, what is there to be
afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free country?
If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come
between?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know, Jack. You&#8217;ve been here too
short a time. You don&#8217;t know this Baldwin. You
don&#8217;t know McGinty and his Scowrers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know them, and I don&#8217;t fear them,
and I don&#8217;t believe in them!&#8221; said McMurdo. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
lived among rough men, my darling, and instead
of fearing them it has always ended that they have
feared me&#8212;always, Ettie. It&#8217;s mad on the face of it!
If these men, as your father says, have done crime
after crime in the valley, and if everyone knows
them by name, how comes it that none are brought
to justice? You answer me that, Ettie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because no witness dares to appear against
them. He would not live a month if he did. Also
because they have always their own men to swear
that the accused one was far from the scene of the
crime. But surely, Jack, you must have read all this.
I had understood that every paper in the United
States was writing about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have read something, it is true; but
I had thought it was a story. Maybe these men
have some reason in what they do. Maybe they
are wronged and have no other way to help them-
selves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, don&#8217;t let me hear you speak so! That
is how he speaks&#8212;the other one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Baldwin&#8212;he speaks like that, does he?&#8221;
&#8220;And that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack,
</p>
<p>now I can tell you the truth. I loathe him with all
my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him for my-
self; but above all I fear him for father. I know that
some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared
to say what I really felt. That is why I have put
him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our
only hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we
could take father with us and live forever far from
the power of these wicked men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo&#8217;s
face, and again it set like granite. &#8220;No harm shall
come to you, Ettie&#8212;nor to your father either. As
to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as
bad as the worst of them before we&#8217;re through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Jack! I would trust you anywhere.&#8221;
McMurdo laughed bitterly. &#8220;Good Lord! how
</p>
<p>little you know of me! Your innocent soul, my dar-
ling, could not even guess what is passing in mine.
But, hullo, who&#8217;s the visitor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door had opened suddenly, and a young
fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who
is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young
man of about the same age and build as McMurdo
himself. Under his broad-brimmed black felt hat,
which he had not troubled to remove, a handsome
face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved
hawk-bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who
sat by the stove.
</p>
<p>Ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion
and alarm. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Mr. Baldwin,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;You&#8217;re earlier than I had thought. Come
and sit down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips look-
ing at McMurdo. &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; he asked curtly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new
boarder here. Mr. McMurdo, may I introduce you
to Mr. Baldwin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young men nodded in surly fashion to
each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with
us?&#8221; said Baldwin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand that there was any rela-
tion between you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you? Well, you can understand it now.
You can take it from me that this young lady is
mine, and you&#8217;ll find it a very fine evening for a
walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>709</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; The man&#8217;s savage eyes were
blazing with anger. &#8220;Maybe you are in a humour
for a fight, Mr. Boarder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I am!&#8221; cried McMurdo, springing to his
feet. &#8220;You never said a more welcome word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Jack! Oh, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221;
cried poor, distracted Ettie. &#8220;Oh, Jack, Jack, he will
hurt you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Jack, is it?&#8221; said Baldwin with an oath.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve come to that already, have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted, be reasonable&#8212;be kind! For my
sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and
forgiving!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone
we could get this thing settled,&#8221; said McMurdo
quietly. &#8220;Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will take
a turn down the street with me. It&#8217;s a fine evening,
and there&#8217;s some open ground beyond the next
block.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get even with you without needing to dirty
my hands,&#8221; said his enemy. &#8220;You&#8217;ll wish you had
never set foot in this house before I am through
with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No time like the present,&#8221; cried McMurdo.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll choose my own time, mister. You can leave
</p>
<p>the time to me. See here!&#8221; He suddenly rolled up
his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar
sign which appeared to have been branded there.
It was a circle with a triangle within it. &#8220;D&#8217;you
know what that means?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I neither know nor care!&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you will know, I&#8217;ll promise you that. You
</p>
<p>won&#8217;t be much older, either. Perhaps Miss Ettie
can tell you something about it. As to you, Ettie,
you&#8217;ll come back to me on your knees&#8212;d&#8217;ye hear,
girl?&#8212;on your knees&#8212;and then I&#8217;ll tell you what
your punishment may be. You&#8217;ve sowed&#8212;and by
the Lord, I&#8217;ll see that you reap!&#8221; He glanced at
them both in fury. Then he turned upon his heel,
and an instant later the outer door had banged be-
hind him.
</p>
<p>For a few moments McMurdo and the girl
stood in silence. Then she threw her arms around
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no
use, you must fly! To-night&#8212;Jack&#8212;to-night! It&#8217;s
your only hope. He will have your life. I read it
in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against
a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the
power of the lodge behind them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her,
and gently pushed her back into a chair. &#8220;There,
</p>
<p>acushla, there! Don&#8217;t be disturbed or fear for me.
I&#8217;m a Freeman myself. I&#8217;m after telling your father
about it. Maybe I am no better than the others; so
don&#8217;t make a saint of me. Perhaps you hate me
too, now that I&#8217;ve told you as much?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never
do that! I&#8217;ve heard that there is no harm in be-
ing a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should
I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a
Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and
make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry, Jack,
hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will
be on your trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking the same thing,&#8221; said Mc-
Murdo. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go right now and fix it. You can tell
your father that I&#8217;ll sleep here to-night and find
some other quarters in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bar of McGinty&#8217;s saloon was crowded as
usual, for it was the favourite loafing place of all
the rougher elements of the town. The man was
popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition
which formed a mask, covering a great deal which
lay behind it. But apart from this popularity, the
fear in which he was held throughout the town-
ship, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of
the valley and past the mountains on each side
of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none
could afford to neglect his good will.
</p>
<p>Besides those secret powers which it was uni-
versally believed that he exercised in so pitiless
a fashion, he was a high public official, a mu-
nicipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads,
elected to the office through the votes of the ruffi-
ans who in turn expected to receive favours at his
hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the
public works were notoriously neglected, the ac-
counts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and
the decent citizen was terrorized into paying pub-
lic blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some
worse thing befall him.
</p>
<p>Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty&#8217;s
diamond pins became more obtrusive, his gold
chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest,
and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it
threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market
Square.
</p>
<p>McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of
the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of
men within, through an atmosphere blurred with
tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spir-
its. The place was brilliantly lighted, and the huge,
heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and
multiplied the garish illumination. There were
several bartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at

<p>At the far end, with his body resting upon the
bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the
corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong, heavily
built man who could be none other than the fa-
mous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned gi-
ant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock
of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complex-
ion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his
eyes were of a strange dead black, which, com-
bined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly
sinister appearance.
</p>
<p>All else in the man&#8212;his noble proportions, his
fine features, and his frank bearing&#8212;fitted in with
that jovial, man-to-man manner which he affected.
Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow,
whose heart would be sound however rude his
outspoken words might seem. It was only when
those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were
turned upon a man that he shrank within himself,
feeling that he was face to face with an infinite pos-
sibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage
and cunning behind it which made it a thousand
times more deadly.
</p>
<p>Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo
elbowed his way forward with his usual careless
audacity, and pushed himself through the little
group of courtiers who were fawning upon the
powerful boss, laughing uproariously at the small-
est of his jokes. The young stranger&#8217;s bold gray
eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at
the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, young man, I can&#8217;t call your face to
mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m new here, Mr. McGinty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not so new that you can&#8217;t give a gen-
tleman his proper title.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Councillor McGinty, young man,&#8221; said a
voice from the group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Councillor. I&#8217;m strange to the ways
of the place. But I was advised to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see me. This is all there is. What
d&#8217;you think of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s early days. If your heart is as big as
your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then
I&#8217;d ask for nothing better,&#8221; said McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gar! you&#8217;ve got an Irish tongue in your
head anyhow,&#8221; cried the saloon-keeper, not quite
certain whether to humour this audacious visitor
or to stand upon his dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are good enough to pass my appear-
ance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said McMurdo.
&#8220;And you were told to see me?&#8221;
&#8220;I was.&#8221;
&#8220;And who told you?&#8221;
&#8220;Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I
</p>
<p>drink your health Councillor, and to our better ac-
quaintance.&#8221; He raised a glass with which he had
been served to his lips and elevated his little finger
as he drank it.
</p>
<p>McGinty, who had been watching him nar-
rowly, raised his thick black eyebrows. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s
like that, is it?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to look a bit
closer into this, Mister&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;McMurdo.&#8221;
&#8220;A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don&#8217;t take
</p>
<p>folk on trust in these parts, nor believe all we&#8217;re
told neither. Come in here for a moment, behind
the bar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a small room there, lined with bar-
rels. McGinty carefully closed the door, and then
seated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully
on his cigar and surveying his companion with
those disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes
he sat in complete silence. McMurdo bore the in-
spection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket,
the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly
McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking
revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my joker,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I thought you
were playing any game on us, it would be short
work for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a strange welcome,&#8221; McMurdo an-
swered with some dignity, &#8220;for the Bodymaster of
a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but it&#8217;s just that same that you have to
prove,&#8221; said McGinty, &#8220;and God help you if you
fail! Where were you made?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lodge 29, Chicago.&#8221;
&#8220;When?&#8221;
&#8220;June 24, 1872.&#8221;
&#8220;What Bodymaster?&#8221;
&#8220;James H. Scott.&#8221;
&#8220;Who is your district ruler?&#8221;
&#8220;Bartholomew Wilson.&#8221;
&#8220;Hum! You seem glib enough in your tests.
</p>
<p>What are you doing here?&#8221;
&#8220;Working, the same as you&#8212;but a poorer job.&#8221;
&#8220;You have your back answer quick enough.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I was always quick of speech.&#8221;
</p>
<p>711</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quick of action?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had that name among those that knew
me best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we may try you sooner than you think.
Have you heard anything of the lodge in these
parts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that it takes a man to be a brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you
leave Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if I tell you that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McGinty opened his eyes. He was not used
to being answered in such fashion, and it amused
him. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because no brother may tell another a lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the truth is too bad to tell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put it that way if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, mister, you can&#8217;t expect me, as Body-
master, to pass into the lodge a man for whose past
he can&#8217;t answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a
worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t squeal on a fellow?&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wipe my hand across your face if you say
such words to me!&#8221; cried McGinty hotly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Councillor,&#8221; said McMurdo
meekly. &#8220;I should apologize. I spoke without
thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands.
Look at that clipping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of
the shooting of one Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon,
Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week of
1874.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your work?&#8221; he asked, as he handed back the
paper.
</p>
<p>McMurdo nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you shoot him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars.
Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they
looked as well and were cheaper to make. This
man Pinto helped me to shove the queer&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To do what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it means to pass the dollars out into cir-
culation. Then he said he would split. Maybe he
did split. I didn&#8217;t wait to see. I just killed him and
lighted out for the coal country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the coal country?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;d read in the papers that they weren&#8217;t
too particular in those parts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McGinty laughed. &#8220;You were first a coiner and
then a murderer, and you came to these parts be-
cause you thought you&#8217;d be welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it,&#8221; McMurdo an-
swered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;ll go far. Say, can you make
those dollars yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket.
&#8220;Those never passed the Philadelphia mint,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; McGinty held them to the
light in his enormous hand, which was hairy as
a gorilla&#8217;s. &#8220;I can see no difference. Gar! you&#8217;ll
be a mighty useful brother, I&#8217;m thinking! We can
do with a bad man or two among us, Friend Mc-
Murdo: for there are times when we have to take
our own part. We&#8217;d soon be against the wall if we
didn&#8217;t shove back at those that were pushing us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll do my share of shoving with
the rest of the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have a good nerve. You didn&#8217;t
squirm when I shoved this gun at you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not me that was in danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you, Councillor.&#8221; McMurdo drew a
cocked pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket.
&#8220;I was covering you all the time. I guess my shot
would have been as quick as yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gar!&#8221; McGinty flushed an angry red and
then burst into a roar of laughter. &#8220;Say, we&#8217;ve had
no such holy terror come to hand this many a year.
I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you
. . . Well, what the hell do you want? And can&#8217;t I
speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but
you must butt in on us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bartender stood abashed. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,
Councillor, but it&#8217;s Ted Baldwin. He says he must
see you this very minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel
face of the man himself was looking over the ser-
vant&#8217;s shoulder. He pushed the bartender out and
closed the door on him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said he with a furious glance at Mc-
Murdo, &#8220;you got here first, did you? I&#8217;ve a word
to say to you, Councillor, about this man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then say it here and now before my face,&#8221;
cried McMurdo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it at my own time, in my own way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! Tut!&#8221; said McGinty, getting off his barrel.
&#8220;This will never do. We have a new brother here,
Baldwin, and it&#8217;s not for us to greet him in such
</p>
<p>712</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Bodymaster
</p>
<p>fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it
up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Baldwin in a fury.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve offered to fight him if he thinks I have
</p>
<p>wronged him,&#8221; said McMurdo. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fight him with
fists, or, if that won&#8217;t satisfy him, I&#8217;ll fight him any
other way he chooses. Now, I&#8217;ll leave it to you,
Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster
should.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221;
&#8220;A young lady. She&#8217;s free to choose for her-
</p>
<p>self.&#8221;
&#8220;Is she?&#8221; cried Baldwin.
&#8220;As between two brothers of the lodge I should
</p>
<p>say that she was,&#8221; said the Boss.
&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s your ruling, is it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,&#8221; said McGinty, with a
</p>
<p>wicked stare. &#8220;Is it you that would dispute it?&#8221;
&#8220;You would throw over one that has stood by
</p>
<p>you this five years in favour of a man that you
never saw before in your life? You&#8217;re not Body-
master for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when
next it comes to a vote&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His
hand closed round the other&#8217;s neck, and he hurled
him back across one of the barrels. In his mad fury
he would have squeezed the life out of him if Mc-
Murdo had not interfered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Councillor! For heaven&#8217;s sake, go easy!&#8221;
he cried, as he dragged him back.
</p>
<p>McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin,
cowed and shaken gasping for breath, and shiv-
ering in every limb, as one who has looked over
the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over
which he had been hurled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been asking for it this many a day, Ted
Baldwin&#8212;now you&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; cried McGinty, his
huge chest rising and falling. &#8220;Maybe you think
if I was voted down from Bodymaster you would
find yourself in my shoes. It&#8217;s for the lodge to say
that. But so long as I am the chief I&#8217;ll have no man
lift his voice against me or my rulings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing against you,&#8221; mumbled Bald-
win, feeling his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; cried the other, relapsing in a mo-
ment into a bluff joviality, &#8220;we are all good friends
again and there&#8217;s an end of the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took a bottle of champagne down from the
shelf and twisted out the cork.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See now,&#8221; he continued, as he filled three high
glasses. &#8220;Let us drink the quarrelling toast of the
lodge. After that, as you know, there can be no
bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on
the apple of my throat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin,
what is the offense, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clouds are heavy,&#8221; answered Baldwin.
&#8220;But they will forever brighten.&#8221;
&#8220;And this I swear!&#8221;
The men drank their glasses, and the same cer-
</p>
<p>emony was performed between Baldwin and Mc-
Murdo
</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; cried McGinty, rubbing his hands.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of the black blood. You come un-
der lodge discipline if it goes further, and that&#8217;s
a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Bald-
win knows&#8212;and as you will damn soon find out,
Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, I&#8217;d be slow to do that,&#8221; said McMurdo.
He held out his hand to Baldwin. &#8220;I&#8217;m quick to
quarrel and quick to forgive. It&#8217;s my hot Irish
blood, they tell me. But it&#8217;s over for me, and I
bear no grudge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baldwin had to take the proffered hand, for the
baleful eye of the terrible Boss was upon him. But
his sullen face showed how little the words of the
other had moved him.
</p>
<p>McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders.
&#8220;Tut! These girls! These girls!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;To think
that the same petticoats should come between two
of my boys! It&#8217;s the devil&#8217;s own luck! Well, it&#8217;s the
colleen inside of them that must settle the ques-
tion for it&#8217;s outside the jurisdiction of a Bodymas-
ter&#8212;and the Lord be praised for that! We have
enough on us, without the women as well. You&#8217;ll
have to be affiliated to Lodge 341, Brother Mc-
Murdo. We have our own ways and methods, dif-
ferent from Chicago. Saturday night is our meet-
ing, and if you come then, we&#8217;ll make you free
forever of the Vermissa Valley.&#8221;

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
Lodge 341, Vermissa
</p>
<p>On the day following the evening which had
contained so many exciting events, McMurdo
moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter&#8217;s and
took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara&#8217;s
on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan,
his original acquaintance aboard the train, had oc-
casion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa,
and the two lodged together. There was no other
boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old
Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that
they had a freedom for speech and action welcome
to men who had secrets in common.
</p>
<p>Shafter had relented to the extent of letting Mc-
Murdo come to his meals there when he liked; so
that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means
broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more
intimate as the weeks went by.
</p>
<p>In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt
it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under
many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers
from the lodge were allowed to come in and see
them, each carrying away in his pocket some ex-
amples of the false money, so cunningly struck that
there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in
passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his
command, McMurdo should condescend to work
at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;
though he made it clear to anyone who asked him
that if he lived without any visible means it would
very quickly bring the police upon his track.
</p>
<p>One policeman was indeed after him already;
but the incident, as luck would have it, did the
adventurer a great deal more good than harm. Af-
ter the first introduction there were few evenings
when he did not find his way to McGinty&#8217;s saloon,
there to make closer acquaintance with &#8220;the boys,&#8221;
which was the jovial title by which the dangerous
gang who infested the place were known to one
another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of
speech made him a favourite with them all; while
the rapid and scientific way in which he polished
off his antagonist in an &#8220;all in&#8221; bar-room scrap
earned the respect of that rough community. An-
other incident, however, raised him even higher in
their estimation.
</p>
<p>Just at the crowded hour one night, the door
opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uni-
form and peaked cap of the mine police. This was
a special body raised by the railways and colliery
owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary
civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face
</p>
<p>of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the
district. There was a hush as he entered, and many
a curious glance was cast at him; but the rela-
tions between policemen and criminals are pecu-
liar in some parts of the States, and McGinty him-
self standing behind his counter, showed no sur-
prise when the policeman enrolled himself among
his customers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A straight whisky, for the night is bitter,&#8221; said
the police officer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have met be-
fore, Councillor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be the new captain?&#8221; said McGinty.
&#8220;That&#8217;s so. We&#8217;re looking to you, Councillor,
</p>
<p>and to the other leading citizens, to help us in up-
holding law and order in this township. Captain
Marvin is my name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d do better without you, Captain Marvin,&#8221;
said McGinty coldly; &#8220;for we have our own police
of the township, and no need for any imported
goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capi-
talists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer
fellow citizen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we won&#8217;t argue about that,&#8221; said
the police officer good-humouredly. &#8220;I expect we
all do our duty same as we see it; but we can&#8217;t
all see it the same.&#8221; He had drunk off his glass
and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the
face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his
elbow. &#8220;Hullo! Hullo!&#8221; he cried, looking him up
and down. &#8220;Here&#8217;s an old acquaintance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo shrank away from him. &#8220;I was never
a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my
life,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#
