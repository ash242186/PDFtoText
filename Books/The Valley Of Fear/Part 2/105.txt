<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>stuffed with the powder which was used in the
quarries. It was two in the morning before they
came to the lonely house. The night was a windy
one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across
the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been
warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds;
so they moved forward cautiously, with their pis-
tols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound
save the howling of the wind, and no movement
but the swaying branches above them.
</p>
<p>McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely
house; but all was still within. Then he leaned the
powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his
knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well
alight he and his two companions took to their
heels, and were some distance off, safe and snug
in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of
the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the
collapsing building, told them that their work was
done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out in
the bloodstained annals of the society.
</p>
<p>But alas that work so well organized and boldly
carried out should all have gone for nothing!
Warned by the fate of the various victims, and
knowing that he was marked down for destruc-
tion, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his
family only the day before to some safer and less
known quarters, where a guard of police should
watch over them. It was an empty house which
had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the
grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teach-
ing discipline to the miners of Iron Dike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him to me,&#8221; said McMurdo. &#8220;He&#8217;s my
man, and I&#8217;ll get him sure if I have to wait a year
for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in
full lodge, and so for the time the matter ended.
</p>
<p>When a few weeks later it was reported in the pa-
pers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambus-
cade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still
at work upon his unfinished job.
</p>
<p>Such were the methods of the Society of
Freemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowr-
ers by which they spread their rule of fear over
the great and rich district which was for so long
a period haunted by their terrible presence. Why
should these pages be stained by further crimes?
Have I not said enough to show the men and their
methods?
</p>
<p>These deeds are written in history, and there
are records wherein one may read the details of
them. There one may learn of the shooting of Po-
licemen Hunt and Evans because they had ven-
tured to arrest two members of the society&#8212;a dou-
ble outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge and car-
ried out in cold blood upon two helpless and dis-
armed men. There also one may read of the shoot-
ing of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing her hus-
band, who had been beaten almost to death by or-
ders of Boss McGinty. The killing of the elder Jenk-
ins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the mu-
tilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the
Staphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals
all followed hard upon one another in the same
terrible winter.
</p>
<p>Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear.
The spring had come with running brooks and
blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature
bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was
there any hope for the men and women who lived
under the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud
above them been so dark and hopeless as in the
early summer of the year 1875.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
Danger
</p>
<p>It was the height of the reign of terror. Mc-
Murdo, who had already been appointed Inner
Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeed-
ing McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary
to the councils of his comrades that nothing was
done without his help and advice. The more pop-
</p>
<p>ular he became, however, with the Freemen, the
blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he
passed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of
their terror the citizens were taking heart to band
themselves together against their oppressors. Ru-
mours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings
</p>
<p>730</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Danger
</p>
<p>in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms
among the law-abiding people. But McGinty and
his men were undisturbed by such reports. They
were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their
opponents were scattered and powerless. It would
all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk
and possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty,
McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.
</p>
<p>It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday
was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was
leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the
weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His
brow was creased with care, and his kindly face
was drawn and haggard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?&#8221;
&#8220;Sure.&#8221;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t forget that I spoke my heart to you
</p>
<p>once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though
the Boss himself came to ask you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could I do if you trusted me? It
wasn&#8217;t that I agreed with what you said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that well. But you are the one that I
can speak to and be safe. I&#8217;ve a secret here,&#8221; he
put his hand to his breast, &#8220;and it is just burning
the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one
of you but me. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for
sure. If I don&#8217;t, it may bring the end of us all. God
help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was
trembling in every limb. He poured some whisky
into a glass and handed it to him. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
physic for the likes of you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now let me
hear of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge
of colour. &#8220;I can tell it to you all in one sentence,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;There&#8217;s a detective on our trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo stared at him in astonishment.
&#8220;Why, man, you&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the place
full of police and detectives and what harm did
they ever do us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s no man of the district. As you say,
we know them, and it is little that they can do. But
you&#8217;ve heard of Pinkerton&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read of some folk of that name.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you can take it from me you&#8217;ve no show
</p>
<p>when they are on your trail. It&#8217;s not a take-it-or-
miss-it government concern. It&#8217;s a dead earnest
business proposition that&#8217;s out for results and
keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them. If
a Pinkerton man is deep in this business, we are
all destroyed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must kill him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s the first thought that came to you! So
it will be up at the lodge. Didn&#8217;t I say to you that
it would end in murder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, what is murder? Isn&#8217;t it common
enough in these parts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed; but it&#8217;s not for me to point out
the man that is to be murdered. I&#8217;d never rest easy
again. And yet it&#8217;s our own necks that may be at
stake. In God&#8217;s name what shall I do?&#8221; He rocked
to and fro in his agony of indecision.
</p>
<p>But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It
was easy to see that he shared the other&#8217;s opinion
as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He
gripped Morris&#8217;s shoulder and shook him in his
earnestness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, man,&#8221; he cried, and he almost
screeched the words in his excitement, &#8220;you won&#8217;t
gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife
at a wake. Let&#8217;s have the facts. Who is the fellow?
Where is he? How did you hear of him? Why did
you come to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to you; for you are the one man that
would advise me. I told you that I had a store
in the East before I came here. I left good friends
behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph ser-
vice. Here&#8217;s a letter that I had from him yesterday.
It&#8217;s this part from the top of the page. You can read
it yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was what McMurdo read:
</p>
<p>How are the Scowrers getting on in
your parts? We read plenty of them in
the papers. Between you and me I ex-
pect to hear news from you before long.
Five big corporations and the two rail-
roads have taken the thing up in dead
earnest. They mean it, and you can bet
they&#8217;ll get there! They are right deep
down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold
under their orders, and his best man,
Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing
has got to be stopped right now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now read the postscript.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course, what I give you is what I
learned in business; so it goes no fur-
ther. It&#8217;s a queer cipher that you han-
dle by the yard every day and can get
no meaning from.
</p>
<p>731</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>McMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the
letter in his listless hands. The mist had lifted for
a moment, and there was the abyss before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anyone else know of this?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told no one else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this man&#8212;your friend&#8212;has he any other
person that he would be likely to write to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I dare say he knows one or two more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the lodge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was asking because it is likely that he may
have given some description of this fellow Birdy
Edwards&#8212;then we could get on his trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s possible. But I should not think he
knew him. He is just telling me the news that came
to him by way of business. How would he know
this Pinkerton man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo gave a violent start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gar!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got him. What a fool
I was not to know it. Lord! but we&#8217;re in luck! We
will fix him before he can do any harm. See here,
Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, if you will only take it off mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that. You can stand right back and let
me run it. Even your name need not be mentioned.
I&#8217;ll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this
letter has come. Will that content you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just what I would ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then leave it at that and keep your head shut.
Now I&#8217;ll get down to the lodge, and we&#8217;ll soon
make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t kill this man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier
your conscience will be, and the better you will
sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle
themselves. I have hold of it now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morris shook his head sadly as he left. &#8220;I feel
that his blood is on my hands,&#8221; he groaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,&#8221; said
McMurdo, smiling grimly. &#8220;It&#8217;s him or us. I guess
this man would destroy us all if we left him long
in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we&#8217;ll have to
elect you Bodymaster yet; for you&#8217;ve surely saved
the lodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And yet it was clear from his actions that he
thought more seriously of this new intrusion than
his words would show. It may have been his guilty
conscience, it may have been the reputation of
the Pinkerton organization, it may have been the
knowledge that great, rich corporations had set
</p>
<p>themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers;
but, whatever his reason, his actions were those
of a man who is preparing for the worst. Ev-
ery paper which would incriminate him was de-
stroyed before he left the house. After that he gave
a long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him
that he was safe. And yet the danger must still
have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way
to the lodge he stopped at old man Shafter&#8217;s. The
house was forbidden him; but when he tapped at
the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing
Irish deviltry had gone from her lover&#8217;s eyes. She
read his danger in his earnest face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh,
Jack, you are in danger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And
yet it may be wise that we make a move before it
is worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a move?&#8221;
&#8220;I promised you once that I would go some day.
</p>
<p>I think the time is coming. I had news to-night,
bad news, and I see trouble coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The police?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn&#8217;t
</p>
<p>know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean
to the likes of me. I&#8217;m too deep in this thing, and
I may have to get out of it quick. You said you
would come with me if I went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m an honest man in some things, Ettie. I
</p>
<p>wouldn&#8217;t hurt a hair of your bonny head for all
that the world can give, nor ever pull you down
one inch from the golden throne above the clouds
where I always see you. Would you trust me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put her hand in his without a word. &#8220;Well,
then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you,
for indeed it&#8217;s the only way for us. Things are go-
ing to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones.
There may be many of us that will have to look out
for ourselves. I&#8217;m one, anyhow. If I go, by day or
night, it&#8217;s you that must come with me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d come after you, Jack.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, you shall come with me. If this valley
</p>
<p>is closed to me and I can never come back, how can
I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from
the police with never a chance of a message? It&#8217;s
with me you must come. I know a good woman in
the place I come from, and it&#8217;s there I&#8217;d leave you
till we can get married. Will you come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jack, I will come.&#8221;
&#8220;God bless you for your trust in me! It&#8217;s a fiend
</p>
<p>out of hell that I should be if I abused it. Now,
mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and
when it reaches you, you will drop everything and
</p>
<p>732</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Danger
</p>
<p>come right down to the waiting room at the depot
and stay there till I come for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Day or night, I&#8217;ll come at the word, Jack.&#8221;
Somewhat eased in mind, now that his own
</p>
<p>preparations for escape had been begun, Mc-
Murdo went on to the lodge. It had already assem-
bled, and only by complicated signs and counter-
signs could he pass through the outer guard and
inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure
and welcome greeted him as he entered. The long
room was crowded, and through the haze of to-
bacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the
Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Bald-
win, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary,
and a dozen more who were among the leaders of
the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there
to take counsel over his news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, it&#8217;s glad we are to see you, Brother!&#8221;
cried the chairman. &#8220;There&#8217;s business here that
wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lander and Egan,&#8221; explained his neigh-
bour as he took his seat. &#8220;They both claim the
head money given by the lodge for the shooting of
old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who&#8217;s to
say which fired the bullet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand.
The expression of his face froze the attention of the
audience. There was a dead hush of expectation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eminent Bodymaster,&#8221; he said, in a solemn
voice, &#8220;I claim urgency!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother McMurdo claims urgency,&#8221; said
McGinty. &#8220;It&#8217;s a claim that by the rules of this
lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.
&#8220;Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,&#8221; he said,
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the bearer of ill news this day; but it is bet-
ter that it should be known and discussed, than
that a blow should fall upon us without warning
which would destroy us all. I have information
that the most powerful and richest organizations in
this state have bound themselves together for our
destruction, and that at this very moment there is a
Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in
the valley collecting the evidence which may put a
rope round the necks of many of us, and send ev-
ery man in this room into a felon&#8217;s cell. That is the
situation for the discussion of which I have made
a claim of urgency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a dead silence in the room. It was
broken by the chairman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your evidence for this, Brother Mc-
Murdo?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in this letter which has come into my
hands,&#8221; said McMurdo. He read the passage
aloud. &#8220;It is a matter of honour with me that I
can give no further particulars about the letter, nor
put it into your hands; but I assure you that there
is nothing else in it which can affect the interests
of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has
reached me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me say, Mr. Chairman,&#8221; said one of the
older brethren, &#8220;that I have heard of Birdy Ed-
wards, and that he has the name of being the best
man in the Pinkerton service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anyone know him by sight?&#8221; asked
McGinty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said McMurdo, &#8220;I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a murmur of astonishment through
the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we hold him in the hollow of our
hands,&#8221; he continued with an exulting smile upon
his face. &#8220;If we act quickly and wisely, we can cut
this thing short. If I have your confidence and your
help, it is little that we have to fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have we to fear, anyhow? What can he
know of our affairs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say so if all were as stanch as you,
Councillor. But this man has all the millions of the
capitalists at his back. Do you think there is no
weaker brother among all our lodges that could
not be bought? He will get at our secrets&#8212;maybe
has got them already. There&#8217;s only one sure cure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he never leaves the valley,&#8221; said Baldwin.
</p>
<p>McMurdo nodded. &#8220;Good for you, Brother
Baldwin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You and I have had our differ-
ences, but you have said the true word to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he, then? Where shall we know
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eminent Bodymaster,&#8221; said McMurdo,
earnestly, &#8220;I would put it to you that this is too
vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God
forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here;
but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears
of this man, there would be an end of any chance
of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose
a trusty committee, Mr. Chairman&#8212;yourself, if I
might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and
five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know
and of what I advise should be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The proposition was at once adopted, and the
committee chosen. Besides the chairman and Bald-
win there were the vulture-faced secretary, Har-
raway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin,
Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby,
</p>
<p>733</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>fearless and desperate men who would stick at
nothing.
</p>
<p>The usual revelry of the lodge was short and
subdued: for there was a cloud upon the men&#8217;s
spirits, and many there for the first time began
to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in
that serene sky under which they had dwelt so
long. The horrors they had dealt out to others had
been so much a part of their settled lives that the
thought of retribution had become a remote one,
and so seemed the more startling now that it came
so closely upon them. They broke up early and left
their leaders to their council.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, McMurdo!&#8221; said McGinty when they
were alone. The seven men sat frozen in their
seats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,&#8221;
McMurdo explained. &#8220;I need not tell you that he
is not here under that name. He&#8217;s a brave man, but
not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve
Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson&#8217;s Patch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know this?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I fell into talk with him. I thought lit-
</p>
<p>tle of it at the time, nor would have given it a sec-
ond thought but for this letter; but now I&#8217;m sure
it&#8217;s the man. I met him on the cars when I went
down the line on Wednesday&#8212;a hard case if ever
there was one. He said he was a reporter. I be-
lieved it for the moment. Wanted to know all he
could about the Scowrers and what he called &#8216;the
outrages&#8217; for a New York paper. Asked me ev-
ery kind of question so as to get something. You
bet I was giving nothing away. &#8216;I&#8217;d pay for it and
pay well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;if I could get some stuff that
would suit my editor.&#8217; I said what I thought would
please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar
bill for my information. &#8216;There&#8217;s ten times that for
you,&#8217; said he, &#8216;if you can find me all that I want.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you tell him, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Any stuff I could make up.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know he wasn&#8217;t a newspaper
</p>
<p>man?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you. He got out at Hobson&#8217;s Patch, and
</p>
<p>so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and
he was leaving it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;See here,&#8217; said the operator after he&#8217;d gone
out, &#8216;I guess we should charge double rates for
this.&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;I guess you should,&#8217; said I. He had filled
the form with stuff that might have been Chinese,
for all we could make of it. &#8216;He fires a sheet of
this off every day,&#8217; said the clerk. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I; &#8216;it&#8217;s

it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not go right down now and fix him?&#8221;
someone suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, the sooner the better.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;d start this next minute if I knew where we
</p>
<p>could find him,&#8221; said McMurdo. &#8220;He&#8217;s in Hob-
son&#8217;s Patch; but I don&#8217;t know the house. I&#8217;ve got a
plan, though, if you&#8217;ll only take my advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I&#8217;ll
</p>
<p>find him through the operator. He can locate him,
I guess. Well, then I&#8217;ll tell him that I&#8217;m a Freeman
