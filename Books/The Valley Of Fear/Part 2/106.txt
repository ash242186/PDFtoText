</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Trapping of Birdy Edwards
</p>
<p>As McMurdo had said, the house in which he
lived was a lonely one and very well suited for
such a crime as they had planned. It was on the
extreme fringe of the town and stood well back
from the road. In any other case the conspirators
would have simply called out their man, as they
had many a time before, and emptied their pis-
tols into his body; but in this instance it was very
necessary to find out how much he knew, how he
knew it, and what had been passed on to his em-
ployers.
</p>
<p>It was possible that they were already too late
and that the work had been done. If that was
indeed so, they could at least have their revenge
upon the man who had done it. But they were
hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet
come to the detective&#8217;s knowledge, as otherwise,
they argued, he would not have troubled to write
down and forward such trivial information as Mc-
Murdo claimed to have given him. However, all
this they would learn from his own lips. Once in
their power, they would find a way to make him
speak. It was not the first time that they had han-
dled an unwilling witness.
</p>
<p>McMurdo went to Hobson&#8217;s Patch as agreed.
The police seemed to take particular interest in
him that morning, and Captain Marvin&#8212;he who
had claimed the old acquaintance with him at
Chicago&#8212;actually addressed him as he waited at
the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to
speak with him. He was back from his mission
in the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union
House.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said McGinty. The giant was in
his shirt sleeves, with chains and seals gleaming
athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twin-
kling through the fringe of his bristling beard.
Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as
well as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore,
seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows
which had risen before him the night before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon he knows much?&#8221; he asked
anxiously.
</p>
<p>McMurdo shook his head gloomily. &#8220;He&#8217;s been
here some time&#8212;six weeks at the least. I guess he
didn&#8217;t come into these parts to look at the prospect.
If he has been working among us all that time with
the railroad money at his back, I should expect that
</p>
<p>he has got results, and that he has passed them
on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a weak man in the lodge,&#8221; cried
McGinty. &#8220;True as steel, every man of them. And
yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. What
about him? If any man gives us away, it would be
he. I&#8217;ve a mind to send a couple of the boys round
before evening to give him a beating up and see
what they can get from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there would be no harm in that,&#8221; Mc-
Murdo answered. &#8220;I won&#8217;t deny that I have a lik-
ing for Morris and would be sorry to see him come
to harm. He has spoken to me once or twice over
lodge matters, and though he may not see them
the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that
squeals. But still it is not for me to stand between
him and you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix the old devil!&#8221; said McGinty with an
oath. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my eye on him this year past.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know best about that,&#8221; McMurdo
answered. &#8220;But whatever you do must be to-
morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton
affair is settled up. We can&#8217;t afford to set the po-
lice buzzing, to-day of all days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;True for you,&#8221; said McGinty. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll learn
from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his
news if we have to cut his heart out first. Did he
seem to scent a trap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo laughed. &#8220;I guess I took him on his
weak point,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If he could get on a good
trail of the Scowrers, he&#8217;s ready to follow it into
hell. I took his money,&#8221; McMurdo grinned as he
produced a wad of dollar notes, &#8220;and as much
more when he has seen all my papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What papers?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, there are no papers. But I filled him up
</p>
<p>about constitutions and books of rules and forms
of membership. He expects to get right down to
the end of everything before he leaves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, he&#8217;s right there,&#8221; said McGinty grimly.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he ask you why you didn&#8217;t bring him the
papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As if I would carry such things, and me a sus-
pected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to
me this very day at the depot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I heard of that,&#8221; said McGinty. &#8220;I guess
the heavy end of this business is coming on to you.
We could put him down an old shaft when we&#8217;ve
done with him; but however we work it we can&#8217;t
get past the man living at Hobson&#8217;s Patch and you
being there to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>735</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;If we han-
dle it right, they can never prove the killing,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;No one can see him come to the house after
dark, and I&#8217;ll lay to it that no one will see him go.
Now see here, Councillor, I&#8217;ll show you my plan
and I&#8217;ll ask you to fit the others into it. You will
all come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten.
He is to tap three times, and me to open the door
for him. Then I&#8217;ll get behind him and shut it. He&#8217;s
our man then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all easy and plain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but the next step wants considering. He&#8217;s
a hard proposition. He&#8217;s heavily armed. I&#8217;ve
fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be on
his guard. Suppose I show him right into a room
with seven men in it where he expected to find me
alone. There is going to be shooting, and some-
body is going to be hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the noise is going to bring every damned
copper in the township on top of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is how I should work it. You will all be
in the big room&#8212;same as you saw when you had
a chat with me. I&#8217;ll open the door for him, show
him into the parlour beside the door, and leave
him there while I get the papers. That will give
me the chance of telling you how things are shap-
ing. Then I will go back to him with some faked
papers. As he is reading them I will jump for him
and get my grip on his pistol arm. You&#8217;ll hear me
call and in you will rush. The quicker the better;
for he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more
than I can manage. But I allow that I can hold him
till you come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good plan,&#8221; said McGinty. &#8220;The lodge
will owe you a debt for this. I guess when I move
out of the chair I can put a name to the man that&#8217;s
coming after me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a re-
cruit,&#8221; said McMurdo; but his face showed what
he thought of the great man&#8217;s compliment.
</p>
<p>When he had returned home he made his own
preparations for the grim evening in front of him.
First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith &amp;
Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in
which the detective was to be trapped. It was a
large apartment, with a long deal table in the cen-
tre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the
other sides were windows. There were no shutters
on these: only light curtains which drew across.
McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it
must have struck him that the apartment was very
</p>
<p>exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its distance
from the road made it of less consequence. Finally
he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger.
Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive lit-
tle man who was too weak to stand against the
opinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified
by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes
been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly
what was intended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take
a night off and keep clear of it. There will be
bloody work here before morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, indeed then, Mac,&#8221; Scanlan answered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not the will but the nerve that is wanting in
me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the
colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand.
I&#8217;m not made for it, same as you or McGinty. If the
lodge will think none the worse of me, I&#8217;ll just do
as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men came in good time as arranged. They
were outwardly respectable citizens, well clad and
cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read lit-
tle hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths
and remorseless eyes. There was not a man in the
room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen
times before. They were as hardened to human
murder as a butcher to sheep.
</p>
<p>Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in
guilt, was the formidable Boss. Harraway, the sec-
retary, was a lean, bitter man with a long, scraggy
neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorrupt-
ible fidelity where the finances of the order were
concerned, and with no notion of justice or hon-
esty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter, was a
middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky
expression, and a yellow parchment skin. He was
a capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly
every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain.
The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe
young fellows with determined faces, while their
companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth,
was feared even by his own comrades for the fe-
rocity of his disposition. These were the men who
assembled that night under the roof of McMurdo
for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.
</p>
<p>Their host had placed whisky upon the table,
and they had hastened to prime themselves for the
work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were al-
ready half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out
all their ferocity. Cormac placed his hands on the
stove for an instant&#8212;it had been lighted, for the
nights were still cold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said he, with an oath.
</p>
<p>736</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Trapping of Birdy Edwards
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Baldwin, catching his meaning. &#8220;If
he is strapped to that, we will have the truth out
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the truth out of him, never fear,&#8221;
said McMurdo. He had nerves of steel, this man;
for though the whole weight of the affair was on
him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as
ever. The others marked it and applauded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the one to handle him,&#8221; said the Boss
approvingly. &#8220;Not a warning will he get till your
hand is on his throat. It&#8217;s a pity there are no shut-
ters to your windows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McMurdo went from one to the other and drew
the curtains tighter. &#8220;Sure no one can spy upon us
now. It&#8217;s close upon the hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he won&#8217;t come. Maybe he&#8217;ll get a sniff
of danger,&#8221; said the secretary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come, never fear,&#8221; McMurdo answered.
&#8220;He is as eager to come as you can be to see him.
Hark to that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all sat like wax figures, some with their
glasses arrested halfway to their lips. Three loud
knocks had sounded at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; McMurdo raised his hand in caution.
An exulting glance went round the circle, and
hands were laid upon hidden weapons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sound, for your lives!&#8221; McMurdo whis-
pered, as he went from the room, closing the door
carefully behind him.
</p>
<p>With strained ears the murderers waited. They
counted the steps of their comrade down the pas-
sage. Then they heard him open the outer door.
There were a few words as of greeting. Then they
were aware of a strange step inside and of an un-
familiar voice. An instant later came the slam of
the door and the turning of the key in the lock.
Their prey was safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac
laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his
great hand across his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, you fool!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
the undoing of us yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a mutter of conversation from the
next room. It seemed interminable. Then the door
opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger upon
his lip.
</p>
<p>He came to the end of the table and looked
round at them. A subtle change had come over
him. His manner was as of one who has great
work to do. His face had set into granite firmness.
His eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind
his spectacles. He had become a visible leader of
men. They stared at him with eager interest; but
</p>
<p>he said nothing. Still with the same singular gaze
he looked from man to man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; cried Boss McGinty at last. &#8220;Is he here?
Is Birdy Edwards here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; McMurdo answered slowly. &#8220;Birdy Ed-
wards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were ten seconds after that brief speech
during which the room might have been empty, so
profound was the silence. The hissing of a kettle
upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear.
Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man
who dominated them, were set motionless with ut-
ter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass,
a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through
each window, while the curtains were torn from
their hangings.
</p>
<p>At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a
wounded bear and plunged for the half-opened
door. A levelled revolver met him there with the
stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Po-
lice gleaming behind the sights. The Boss recoiled
and fell back into his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re safer there, Councillor,&#8221; said the man
whom they had known as McMurdo. &#8220;And you,
Baldwin, if you don&#8217;t take your hand off your pis-
tol, you&#8217;ll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or
by the Lord that made me&#8212;There, that will do.
There are forty armed men round this house, and
you can figure it out for yourself what chance you
have. Take their pistols, Marvin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no possible resistance under the
menace of those rifles. The men were disarmed.
Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round
the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to say a word to you before we sep-
arate,&#8221; said the man who had trapped them. &#8220;I
guess we may not meet again until you see me on
the stand in the courthouse. I&#8217;ll give you some-
thing to think over between now and then. You
know me now for what I am. At last I can put my
cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinker-
ton&#8217;s. I was chosen to break up your gang. I had a
hard and dangerous game to play. Not a soul, not
one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I
was playing it. Only Captain Marvin here and my
employers knew that. But it&#8217;s over to-night, thank
God, and I am the winner!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him.
There was unappeasable hatred in their eyes. He
read the relentless threat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you think that the game is not over yet.
Well, I take my chance of that. Anyhow, some of
you will take no further hand, and there are sixty
</p>
<p>737</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>more besides yourselves that will see a jail this
night. I&#8217;ll tell you this, that when I was put upon
this job I never believed there was such a society
as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I
would prove it so. They told me it was to do with
the Freemen; so I went to Chicago and was made
one. Then I was surer than ever that it was just
paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but
a deal of good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I had to carry out my job, and I came
to the coal valleys. When I reached this place I
learned that I was wrong and that it wasn&#8217;t a dime
novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never
killed a man in Chicago. I never minted a dollar
in my life. Those I gave you were as good as any
others; but I never spent money better. But I knew
the way into your good wishes and so I pretended
to you that the law was after me. It all worked just
as I thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my
share in your councils. Maybe they will say that I
was as bad as you. They can say what they like, so
long as I get you. But what is the truth? The night
I joined you beat up old man Stanger. I could not
warn him, for there was no time; but I held your
hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him.
If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my
place among you, they were things which I knew I
could prevent. I could not save Dunn and Men-
zies, for I did not know enough; but I will see
that their murderers are hanged. I gave Chester
Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his house in
he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a
crime that I could not stop; but if you look back
and think how often your man came home the
other road, or was down in town when you went
for him, or stayed indoors when you thought he
would come out, you&#8217;ll see my work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You blasted traitor!&#8221; hissed McGinty through
his closed teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, John McGinty, you may call me that if it
eases your smart. You and your like have been
the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took
a man to get between you and the poor devils of
men and women that you held under your grip.
There was just one way of doing it, and I did it.
You call me a traitor; but I guess there&#8217;s many a
thousand will call me a deliverer that went down
into hell to save them. I&#8217;ve had three months of
it. I wouldn&#8217;t have three such months again if they
let me loose in the treasury at Washington for it. I
had to stay till I had it all, every man and every se-
cret right here in this hand. I&#8217;d have waited a little
longer if it hadn&#8217;t come to my knowledge that my
</p>
<p>secret was coming out. A letter had come into the
town that would have set you wise to it all. Then I
had to act and act quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing more to say to you, except that
when my time comes I&#8217;ll die the easier when I
think of the work I have done in this valley. Now,
Marvin, I&#8217;ll keep you no more. Take them in and
get it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There is little more to tell. Scanlan had been
given a sealed note to be left at the address of
Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had ac-
cepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the
early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and
a much muffled man boarded a special train which
had been sent by the railroad company, and made
a swift, unbroken journey out of the land of dan-
ger. It was the last time that ever either Ettie or
her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days
later they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob
Shafter as witness of the wedding.
</p>
<p>The trial of the Scowrers was held far from
the place where their adherents might have terri-
fied the guardians of the law. In vain they strug-
gled. In vain the money of the lodge&#8212;money
squeezed by blackmail out of the whole country-
side&#8212;was spent like water in the attempt to save
them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement
from one who knew every detail of their lives, their
organization, and their crimes was unshaken by all
the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many
years they were broken and scattered. The cloud
was lifted forever from the valley.
</p>
<p>McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cring-
ing and whining when the last hour came. Eight
of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd
had various degrees of imprisonment. The work
of Birdy Edwards was complete.
</p>
<p>And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not
over yet. There was another hand to be played,
and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin, for
one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Will-
abys; so had several others of the fiercest spirits
of the gang. For ten years they were out of the
world, and then came a day when they were free
once more&#8212;a day which Edwards, who knew his
men, was very sure would be an end of his life of
peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they
thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for
their comrades. And well they strove to keep their
vow!
</p>
<p>From Chicago he was chased, after two at-
tempts so near success that it was sure that the
third would get him. From Chicago he went un-
der a changed name to California, and it was there
</p>
<p>738</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Epilogue
</p>
<p>that the light went for a time out of his life when
Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly
killed, and once again under the name of Dou-
glas he worked in a lonely canyon, where with an
English partner named Barker he amassed a for-
tune. At last there came a warning to him that
the bloodhounds were on his track once more, and
</p>
<p>he cleared&#8212;only just in time&#8212;for England. And
thence came the John Douglas who for a second
time married a worthy mate, and lived for five
years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life which
ended with the strange happenings of which we
have heard.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.
Epilogue
</p>
<p>The police trial had passed, in which the case
of John Douglas was referred to a higher court. So
had the Quarter Sessions, at which he was acquit-
ted as having acted in self-defense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him out of England at any cost,&#8221; wrote
Holmes to the wife. &#8220;There are forces here which
may be more dangerous than those he has escaped.
There is no safety for your husband in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two months had gone by, and the case had to
some extent passed from our minds. Then one
morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into
our letter box. &#8220;Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!&#8221;
said this singular epistle. There was neither su-
perscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint
message; but Holmes showed unwonted serious-
ness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deviltry, Watson!&#8221; he remarked, and sat long
with a clouded brow.
</p>
<p>Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady,
brought up a message that a gentleman wished to
see Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost
importance. Close at the heels of his messenger
came Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor
House. His face was drawn and haggard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had bad news&#8212;terrible news, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared as much,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not had a cable, have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a note from someone who has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s poor Douglas. They tell me his name
is Edwards; but he will always be Jack Douglas
of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they
started together for South Africa in the Palmyra
three weeks ago.&#8221;
