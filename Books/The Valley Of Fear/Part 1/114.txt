</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I read it,&#8221; said Barker. &#8220;But, I say,
aren&#8217;t we wasting precious time? Couldn&#8217;t we start
out and scour the country before the fellow gets
away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant considered for a moment.
&#8220;There are no trains before six in the morning;
</p>
<p>so he can&#8217;t get away by rail. If he goes by road
with his legs all dripping, it&#8217;s odds that someone
will notice him. Anyhow, I can&#8217;t leave here myself
until I am relieved. But I think none of you should
go until we see more clearly how we all stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor had taken the lamp and was nar-
rowly scrutinizing the body. &#8220;What&#8217;s this mark?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Could this have any connection with
the crime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dead man&#8217;s right arm was thrust out from
his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the el-
bow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious
brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing
out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not tattooed,&#8221; said the doctor, peering
through his glasses. &#8220;I never saw anything like it.
The man has been branded at some time as they
brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t profess to know the meaning of it,&#8221;
said Cecil Barker; &#8220;but I have seen the mark on
Douglas many times this last ten years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so have I,&#8221; said the butler. &#8220;Many a time
when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have
noticed that very mark. I&#8217;ve often wondered what
it could be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it has nothing to do with the crime, any-
how,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a rum thing all
</p>
<p>the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well,
what is it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The butler had given an exclamation of aston-
ishment and was pointing at the dead man&#8217;s out-
stretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken his wedding ring!&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain
gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left
hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it was
above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third
finger. There&#8217;s the nugget and there&#8217;s the snake,
but the wedding ring is gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Barker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you tell me,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;that the
wedding ring was below the other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first
took off this ring you call the nugget ring, then the
wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring
back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The worthy country policeman shook his head.
&#8220;Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this
case the better,&#8221; said he. &#8220;White Mason is a smart
man. No local job has ever been too much for
White Mason. It won&#8217;t be long now before he is
here to help us. But I expect we&#8217;ll have to look to
London before we are through. Anyhow, I&#8217;m not
ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the
likes of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
Darkness
</p>
<p>At three in the morning the chief Sussex detec-
tive, obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson
of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light
dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-
forty train in the morning he had sent his message
to Scotland Yard, and he was at the Birlstone sta-
tion at twelve o&#8217;clock to welcome us. White Ma-
son was a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a
loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaved, ruddy face,
</p>
<p>a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs adorned
with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired
gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very
favourable specimen of the provincial criminal of-
ficer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!&#8221; he
kept repeating. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have the pressmen down
like flies when they understand it. I&#8217;m hoping
we will get our work done before they get pok-
</p>
<p>678</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Darkness
</p>
<p>ing their noses into it and messing up all the trails.
There has been nothing like this that I can remem-
ber. There are some bits that will come home to
you, Mr. Holmes, or I am mistaken. And you also,
Dr. Watson; for the medicos will have a word to
say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville
Arms. There&#8217;s no other place; but I hear that it
is clean and good. The man will carry your bags.
This way, gentlemen, if you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a very bustling and genial person, this
Sussex detective. In ten minutes we had all found
our quarters. In ten more we were seated in the
parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid
sketch of those events which have been outlined in
the previous chapter. MacDonald made an occa-
sional note, while Holmes sat absorbed, with the
expression of surprised and reverent admiration
with which the botanist surveys the rare and pre-
cious bloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable!&#8221; he said, when the story was un-
folded, &#8220;most remarkable! I can hardly recall any
case where the features have been more peculiar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said
White Mason in great delight. &#8220;We&#8217;re well up with
the times in Sussex. I&#8217;ve told you now how mat-
ters were, up to the time when I took over from
Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morn-
ing. My word! I made the old mare go! But I need
not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out;
for there was nothing immediate that I could do.
Sergeant Wilson had all the facts. I checked them
and considered them and maybe added a few of
my own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were they?&#8221; asked Holmes eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I first had the hammer examined. There
was Dr. Wood there to help me. We found no signs
of violence upon it. I was hoping that if Mr. Dou-
glas defended himself with the hammer, he might
have left his mark upon the murderer before he
dropped it on the mat. But there was no stain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, of course, proves nothing at all,&#8221; re-
marked Inspector MacDonald. &#8220;There has been
many a hammer murder and no trace on the ham-
mer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. It doesn&#8217;t prove it wasn&#8217;t used. But
there might have been stains, and that would have
helped us. As a matter of fact there were none.
Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot car-
tridges, and, as Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the
triggers were wired together so that, if you pulled
on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged.
Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that
he was going to take no chances of missing his
</p>
<p>man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot
long&#8212;one could carry it easily under one&#8217;s coat.
There was no complete maker&#8217;s name; but the
printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between
the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut
off by the saw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A big P with a flourish above it, E and N
smaller?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;Pennsylvania Small Arms Company&#8212;well-
</p>
<p>known American firm,&#8221; said Holmes.
White Mason gazed at my friend as the little
</p>
<p>village practitioner looks at the Harley Street spe-
cialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that
perplex him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt
you are right. Wonderful! Wonderful! Do you
carry the names of all the gun makers in the world
in your memory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave.
&#8220;No doubt it is an American shotgun,&#8221; White
</p>
<p>Mason continued. &#8220;I seem to have read that a
sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts
of America. Apart from the name upon the barrel,
the idea had occurred to me. There is some evi-
dence then, that this man who entered the house
and killed its master was an American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald shook his head. &#8220;Man, you are
surely travelling overfast,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I have heard
no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the
house at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The open window, the blood on the sill, the
queer card, the marks of boots in the corner, the
gun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing there that could not have been ar-
ranged. Mr. Douglas was an American, or had
lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You
don&#8217;t need to import an American from outside in
order to account for American doings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ames, the butler&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;What about him? Is he reliable?&#8221;
&#8220;Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos&#8212;as solid
</p>
<p>as a rock. He has been with Douglas ever since
he took the Manor House five years ago. He has
never seen a gun of this sort in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gun was made to conceal. That&#8217;s why
the barrels were sawed. It would fit into any box.
How could he swear there was no such gun in the
house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.&#8221;
MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not convinced yet that there was ever anyone
</p>
<p>679</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>in the house,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m asking you to con-
seedar&#8221; (his accent became more Aberdonian as
he lost himself in his argument) &#8220;I&#8217;m asking you to
conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this
gun was ever brought into the house, and that all
these strange things were done by a person from
outside. Oh, man, it&#8217;s just inconceivable! It&#8217;s clean
against common sense! I put it to you, Mr. Holmes,
judging it by what we have heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, state your case, Mr. Mac,&#8221; said Holmes
in his most judicial style.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man is not a burglar, supposing that he
ever existed. The ring business and the card point
to premeditated murder for some private reason.
Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house
with the deliberate intention of committing mur-
der. He knows, if he knows anything, that he
will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the
house is surrounded with water. What weapon
would he choose? You would say the most silent in
the world. Then he could hope when the deed was
done to slip quickly from the window, to wade the
moat, and to get away at his leisure. That&#8217;s under-
standable. But is it understandable that he should
go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy
weapon he could select, knowing well that it will
fetch every human being in the house to the spot
as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that
he will be seen before he can get across the moat?
Is that credible, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you put the case strongly,&#8221; my friend
replied thoughtfully. &#8220;It certainly needs a good
deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White Mason,
whether you examined the farther side of the moat
at once to see if there were any signs of the man
having climbed out from the water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a
stone ledge, and one could hardly expect them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No tracks or marks?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Ha! Would there be any objection, Mr. White
</p>
<p>Mason, to our going down to the house at once?
There may possibly be some small point which
might be suggestive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I
thought it well to put you in touch with all the
facts before we go. I suppose if anything should
strike you&#8212;&#8221; White Mason looked doubtfully at
the amateur.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,&#8221; said
Inspector MacDonald. &#8220;He plays the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My own idea of the game, at any rate,&#8221; said
Holmes, with a smile. &#8220;I go into a case to help the
</p>
<p>ends of justice and the work of the police. If I have
ever separated myself from the official force, it is
because they have first separated themselves from
me. I have no wish ever to score at their expense.
At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the
right to work in my own way and give my results
at my own time&#8212;complete rather than in stages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure we are honoured by your presence
and to show you all we know,&#8221; said White Mason
cordially. &#8220;Come along, Dr. Watson, and when the
time comes we&#8217;ll all hope for a place in your book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We walked down the quaint village street with
a row of pollarded elms on each side of it. Just
beyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-
stained and lichen-blotched bearing upon their
summits a shapeless something which had once
been the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone. A
short walk along the winding drive with such
sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural
England, then a sudden turn, and the long, low Ja-
cobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay be-
fore us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews
on each side of it. As we approached it, there was
the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad
moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the
cold, winter sunshine.
</p>
<p>Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor
House, centuries of births and of homecomings, of
country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters.
Strange that now in its old age this dark business
should have cast its shadow upon the venerable
walls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and
quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering
to grim and terrible intrigue. As I looked at the
deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-
coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more
fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the window,&#8221; said White Mason, &#8220;that
one on the immediate right of the drawbridge. It&#8217;s
open just as it was found last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t a fat man, anyhow. We don&#8217;t
need your deductions, Mr. Holmes, to tell us that.
But you or I could squeeze through all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and
looked across. Then he examined the stone ledge
and the grass border beyond it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a good look, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said White
Mason. &#8220;There is nothing there, no sign that any-
one has landed&#8212;but why should he leave any
sign?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Why should he? Is the water always
turbid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>680</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Darkness
</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally about this colour. The stream
brings down the clay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How deep is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two feet at each side and three in the
middle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we can put aside all idea of the man having
been drowned in crossing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a child could not be drowned in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We walked across the drawbridge, and were
admitted by a quaint, gnarled, dried-up person,
who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow
was white and quivering from the shock. The vil-
lage sergeant, a tall, formal, melancholy man, still
held his vigil in the room of Fate. The doctor had
departed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?&#8221; asked
White Mason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can go home. You&#8217;ve had enough.
We can send for you if we want you. The butler
had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr. Ce-
cil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that
we may want a word with them presently. Now,
gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you
the views I have formed first, and then you will be
able to arrive at your own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He impressed me, this country specialist. He
had a solid grip of fact and a cool, clear, common-
sense brain, which should take him some way in
his profession. Holmes listened to him intently,
with no sign of that impatience which the official
exponent too often produced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it suicide, or is it murder&#8212;that&#8217;s our first
question, gentlemen, is it not? If it were suicide,
then we have to believe that this man began by tak-
ing off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he
then came down here in his dressing gown, tram-
pled mud into a corner behind the curtain in or-
der to give the idea someone had waited for him,
opened the window, put blood on the&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can surely dismiss that,&#8221; said MacDonald.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then
a murder has been done. What we have to deter-
mine is, whether it was done by someone outside
or inside the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hear the argument.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are considerable difficulties both ways,
and yet one or the other it must be. We will sup-
pose first that some person or persons inside the
house did the crime. They got this man down here
at a time when everything was still and yet no one
</p>
<p>was asleep. They then did the deed with the queer-
est and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell
everyone what had happened&#8212;a weapon that was
never seen in the house before. That does not seem
a very likely start, does it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it does not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the
alarm was given only a minute at the most had
passed before the whole household&#8212;not Mr. Ce-
cil Barker alone, though he claims to have been
the first, but Ames and all of them were on the
spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty
person managed to make footmarks in the corner,
open the window, mark the sill with blood, take
the wedding ring off the dead man&#8217;s finger, and
all the rest of it? It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You put it very clearly,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I am
inclined to agree with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, we are driven back to the theory
that it was done by someone from outside. We
are still faced with some big difficulties; but any-
how they have ceased to be impossibilities. The
man got into the house between four-thirty and
six; that is to say, between dusk and the time when
the bridge was raised. There had been some vis-
itors, and the door was open; so there was noth-
ing to prevent him. He may have been a common
burglar, or he may have had some private grudge
against Mr. Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent
most of his life in America, and this shotgun seems
to be an American weapon, it would seem that
the private grudge is the more likely theory. He
slipped into this room because it was the first he
came to, and he hid behind the curtain. There
he remained until past eleven at night. At that
time Mr. Douglas entered the room. It was a short
interview, if there were any interview at all; for
Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not
left her more than a few minutes when she heard
the shot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The candle shows that,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. The candle, which was a new one,
is not burned more than half an inch. He must
have placed it on the table before he was attacked;
otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he
fell. This shows that he was not attacked the in-
stant that he entered the room. When Mr. Barker
arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all clear enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those
lines. Mr. Douglas enters the room. He puts down
the candle. A man appears from behind the cur-
tain. He is armed with this gun. He demands
</p>
<p>681</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>the wedding ring&#8212;Heaven only knows why, but
so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up.
Then either in cold blood or in the course of a
struggle&#8212;Douglas may have gripped the hammer
that was found upon the mat&#8212;he shot Douglas
in this horrible way. He dropped his gun and
also it would seem this queer card&#8212;V. V. 341,
whatever that may mean&#8212;and he made his escape
through the window and across the moat at the
very moment when Cecil Barker was discovering
the crime. How&#8217;s that, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very interesting, but just a little unconvinc-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it
wasn&#8217;t that anything else is even worse!&#8221; cried
MacDonald. &#8220;Somebody killed the man, and who-
ever it was I could clearly prove to you that he
should have done it some other way. What does
he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like
that? What does he mean by using a shotgun when
silence was his one chance of escape? Come, Mr.
Holmes, it&#8217;s up to you to give us a lead, since you
say Mr. White Mason&#8217;s theory is unconvincing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had sat intently observant during this
long discussion, missing no word that was said,
with his keen eyes darting to right and to left, and
his forehead wrinkled with speculation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like a few more facts before I get so
far as a theory, Mr. Mac,&#8221; said he, kneeling down
beside the body. &#8220;Dear me! these injuries are re-
ally appalling. Can we have the butler in for a mo-
ment? . . . Ames, I understand that you have often
seen this very unusual mark&#8212;a branded triangle
inside a circle&#8212;upon Mr. Douglas&#8217;s forearm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frequently, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never heard any speculation as to what it
meant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have caused great pain when it was in-
flicted. It is undoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe,
Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at the
angle of Mr. Douglas&#8217;s jaw. Did you observe that
in life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever know him to cut himself in shav-
ing before?&#8221;
</p>
