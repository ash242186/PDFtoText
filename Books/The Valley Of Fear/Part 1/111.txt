<p>CHAPTER I.
The Warning
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>am inclined to think&#8212;&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I should do so,&#8221; Sherlock Holmes
</p>
<p>remarked impatiently.
I believe that I am one of the most
</p>
<p>long-suffering of mortals; but I&#8217;ll admit that I was
annoyed at the sardonic interruption.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Holmes,&#8221; said I severely, &#8220;you are a lit-
tle trying at times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was too much absorbed with his own
thoughts to give any immediate answer to my re-
monstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his
untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the
slip of paper which he had just drawn from its en-
velope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it
up to the light, and very carefully studied both the
exterior and the flap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Porlock&#8217;s writing,&#8221; said he thoughtfully.
&#8220;I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock&#8217;s writing,
though I have seen it only twice before. The Greek
e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if
it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very
first importance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was speaking to himself rather than to me;
but my vexation disappeared in the interest which
the words awakened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who then is Porlock?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere
</p>
<p>identification mark; but behind it lies a shifty and
evasive personality. In a former letter he frankly
informed me that the name was not his own, and
defied me ever to trace him among the teeming
millions of this great city. Porlock is important,
not for himself, but for the great man with whom
he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish
with the shark, the jackal with the lion&#8212;anything
that is insignificant in companionship with what is
formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sin-
ister&#8212;in the highest degree sinister. That is where
he comes within my purview. You have heard me
speak of Professor Moriarty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The famous scientific criminal, as famous
among crooks as&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My blushes, Watson!&#8221; Holmes murmured in a
deprecating voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to say, as he is unknown to the
public.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A touch! A distinct touch!&#8221; cried Holmes.
&#8220;You are developing a certain unexpected vein
of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must
</p>
<p>learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a
criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the
law&#8212;and there lie the glory and the wonder of
it! The greatest schemer of all time, the orga-
nizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the
underworld, a brain which might have made or
marred the destiny of nations&#8212;that&#8217;s the man! But
so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune
from criticism, so admirable in his management
and self-effacement, that for those very words that
you have uttered he could hale you to a court and
emerge with your year&#8217;s pension as a solatium for
his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated au-
thor of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which
ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathe-
matics that it is said that there was no man in the
scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a
man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slan-
dered professor&#8212;such would be your respective
roles! That&#8217;s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by
lesser men, our day will surely come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I be there to see!&#8221; I exclaimed devoutly.
&#8220;But you were speaking of this man Porlock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&#8212;the so-called Porlock is a link in the
chain some little way from its great attachment.
Porlock is not quite a sound link&#8212;between our-
selves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I
have been able to test it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme
importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudi-
mentary aspirations towards right, and encour-
aged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional
ten-pound note sent to him by devious meth-
ods, he has once or twice given me advance in-
formation which has been of value&#8212;that highest
value which anticipates and prevents rather than
avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the
cipher, we should find that this communication is
of the nature that I indicate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his
unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared
down at the curious inscription, which ran as fol-
lows:
</p>
<p>534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41
DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE
</p>
<p>26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171
</p>
<p>667</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it, Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is obviously an attempt to convey secret in-
formation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the use of a cipher message with-
out the cipher?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this instance, none at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say &#8216;in this instance&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there are many ciphers which I would
read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony
column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence
without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is
clearly a reference to the words in a page of some
book. Until I am told which page and which book
I am powerless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why &#8216;Douglas&#8217; and &#8216;Birlstone&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly because those are words which were
not contained in the page in question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why has he not indicated the book?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson,
that innate cunning which is the delight of your
friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing
cipher and message in the same envelope. Should
it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to
go wrong before any harm comes from it. Our sec-
ond post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised
if it does not bring us either a further letter of ex-
planation, or, as is more probable, the very volume
to which these figures refer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s calculation was fulfilled within a very
few minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page,
with the very letter which we were expecting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same writing,&#8221; remarked Holmes, as he
opened the envelope, &#8220;and actually signed,&#8221; he
added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epis-
tle. &#8220;Come, we are getting on, Watson.&#8221; His brow
clouded, however, as he glanced over the contents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear,
Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing.
I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]:
&#8220;I will go no further in this matter.
</p>
<p>It is too dangerous&#8212;he suspects me. I
can see that he suspects me. He came
to me quite unexpectedly after I had ac-
tually addressed this envelope with the
intention of sending you the key to the
cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he
had seen it, it would have gone hard
with me. But I read suspicion in his
eyes. Please burn the cipher message,
which can now be of no use to you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fred Porlock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some little time twisting this let-
ter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared
into the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;there may be noth-
ing in it. It may be only his guilty conscience.
Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read
the accusation in the other&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other being, I presume, Professor Mori-
arty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No less! When any of that party talk about
&#8216;He&#8217; you know whom they mean. There is one
predominant &#8216;He&#8217; for all of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can he do?&#8221;
&#8220;Hum! That&#8217;s a large question. When you have
</p>
<p>one of the first brains of Europe up against you,
and all the powers of darkness at his back, there
are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock
is evidently scared out of his senses&#8212;kindly com-
pare the writing in the note to that upon its en-
velope; which was done, he tells us, before this
ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The
other hardly legible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he write at all? Why did he not sim-
ply drop it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he feared I would make some inquiry
after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble
on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Of course.&#8221; I had picked
up the original cipher message and was bending
my brows over it. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty maddening to think
that an important secret may lie here on this slip
of paper, and that it is beyond human power to
penetrate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his un-
tasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which
was the companion of his deepest meditations. &#8220;I
wonder!&#8221; said he, leaning back and staring at the
ceiling. &#8220;Perhaps there are points which have es-
caped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us consider
the problem in the light of pure reason. This man&#8217;s
reference is to a book. That is our point of depar-
ture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A somewhat vague one.&#8221;
&#8220;Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As
</p>
<p>I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less im-
penetrable. What indications have we as to this
book?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that.
</p>
<p>The cipher message begins with a large 534, does
it not? We may take it as a working hypothesis
</p>
<p>668</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Warning
</p>
<p>that 534 is the particular page to which the ci-
pher refers. So our book has already become a
large book which is surely something gained. What
other indications have we as to the nature of this
large book? The next sign is C2. What do you
make of that, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chapter the second, no doubt.&#8221;
&#8220;Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure,
</p>
<p>agree with me that if the page be given, the num-
ber of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page
534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length
of the first one must have been really intolerable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Column!&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this
</p>
<p>morning. If it is not column, then I am very much
deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visual-
ize a large book printed in double columns which
are each of a considerable length, since one of the
words is numbered in the document as the two
hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the
limits of what reason can supply?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that we have.&#8221;
&#8220;Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more
</p>
<p>coruscation, my dear Watson&#8212;yet another brain-
wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he
would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had
intended, before his plans were nipped, to send
me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his
note. This would seem to indicate that the book is
one which he thought I would have no difficulty
in finding for myself. He had it&#8212;and he imagined
that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a
very common book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you say certainly sounds plausible.&#8221;
&#8220;So we have contracted our field of search to a
</p>
<p>large book, printed in double columns and in com-
mon use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bible!&#8221; I cried triumphantly.
&#8220;Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so,
</p>
<p>quite good enough! Even if I accepted the compli-
ment for myself I could hardly name any volume
which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of
one of Moriarty&#8217;s associates. Besides, the editions
of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly
suppose that two copies would have the same pag-
ination. This is clearly a book which is standard-
ized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will
exactly agree with my page 534.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But very few books would correspond with
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search
is narrowed down to standardized books which
anyone may be supposed to possess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bradshaw!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary
of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. The
selection of words would hardly lend itself to the
sending of general messages. We will eliminate
Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible
for the same reason. What then is left?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An almanac!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken
if you have not touched the spot. An almanac! Let
us consider the claims of Whitaker&#8217;s Almanac. It
is in common use. It has the requisite number of
pages. It is in double column. Though reserved
in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember
right, quite garrulous towards the end.&#8221; He picked
the volume from his desk. &#8220;Here is page 534, col-
umn two, a substantial block of print dealing, I
perceive, with the trade and resources of British In-
dia. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen
is &#8216;Mahratta.&#8217; Not, I fear, a very auspicious begin-
ning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is
&#8216;Government&#8217;; which at least makes sense, though
somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor
Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the
Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is
&#8216;pig&#8217;s-bristles.&#8217; We are undone, my good Watson!
It is finished!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitch-
ing of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappoint-
ment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy,
staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by
a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed
at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a sec-
ond yellow-covered volume in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-
to-date!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We are before our time, and
suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of
January, we have very properly laid in the new
almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock
took his message from the old one. No doubt
he would have told us so had his letter of ex-
planation been written. Now let us see what
page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen
is &#8216;There,&#8217; which is much more promising. Num-
ber one hundred and twenty-seven is &#8216;is&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;There
is&#8217; &#8221;&#8212;Holmes&#8217;s eyes were gleaming with excite-
ment, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as
he counted the words&#8212;&#8220; &#8216;danger.&#8217; Ha! Ha! Cap-
ital! Put that down, Watson. &#8216;There is danger&#8212;
may&#8212;come&#8212;very&#8212;soon&#8212;one.&#8217; Then we have
the name &#8216;Douglas&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;rich&#8212;country&#8212;now&#8212;at&#8212;
Birlstone&#8212;House&#8212;Birlstone&#8212;confidence&#8212;is&#8212;
pressing.&#8217; There, Watson! What do you think
of pure reason and its fruit? If the greengrocer
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send
Billy round for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was staring at the strange message which I
had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of
foolscap on my knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a queer, scrambling way of expressing
his meaning!&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, he has done quite remark-
ably well,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;When you search a sin-
gle column for words with which to express your
meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything
you want. You are bound to leave something to
the intelligence of your correspondent. The pur-
port is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended
against one Douglas, whoever he may be, resid-
ing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is
sure&#8212;&#8216;confidence&#8217; was as near as he could get to
&#8216;confident&#8217;&#8212;that it is pressing. There is our re-
sult&#8212;and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis
it was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true
artist in his better work, even as he mourned
darkly when it fell below the high level to which
he aspired. He was still chuckling over his suc-
cess when Billy swung open the door and Inspec-
tor MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into
the room.
</p>
<p>Those were the early days at the end of the
&#8217;80&#8217;s, when Alec MacDonald was far from hav-
ing attained the national fame which he has now
achieved. He was a young but trusted member
of the detective force, who had distinguished him-
self in several cases which had been entrusted to
him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of excep-
tional physical strength, while his great cranium
and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of
the keen intelligence which twinkled out from be-
hind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise
man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian
accent.
</p>
<p>Twice already in his career had Holmes helped
him to attain success, his own sole reward being
the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason
the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his
amateur colleague were profound, and he showed
them by the frankness with which he consulted
Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows
nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly rec-
ognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough
for his profession to enable him to perceive that
there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance
of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in
his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not
prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big
Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
wish you luck with your worm. I fear this means
that there is some mischief afoot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you said &#8216;hope&#8217; instead of &#8216;fear,&#8217; it would be
nearer the truth, I&#8217;m thinking, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; the
inspector answered, with a knowing grin. &#8220;Well,
maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning
chill. No, I won&#8217;t smoke, I thank you. I&#8217;ll have
to be pushing on my way; for the early hours of a
case are the precious ones, as no man knows better
than your own self. But&#8212;but&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was
staring with a look of absolute amazement at a pa-
per upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I
had scrawled the enigmatic message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Douglas!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Birlstone! What&#8217;s
this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it&#8217;s witchcraft! Where in
the name of all that is wonderful did you get those
names?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had
occasion to solve. But why&#8212;what&#8217;s amiss with the
names?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector looked from one to the other of
us in dazed astonishment. &#8220;Just this,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was
horribly murdered last night!&#8221;

<p>CHAPTER II.
Sherlock Holmes Discourses
</p>
<p>It was one of those dramatic moments for
which my friend existed. It would be an overstate-
ment to say that he was shocked or even excited
by the amazing announcement. Without having a
tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was
undoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation.
Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual
perceptions were exceedingly active. There was
no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt
at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather
the quiet and interested composure of the chemist
who sees the crystals falling into position from his
oversaturated solution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Remarkable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised.
Why should I be surprised? I receive an anony-
mous communication from a quarter which I know
to be important, warning me that danger threatens
a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this
danger has actually materialized and that the per-
son is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I
am not surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few short sentences he explained to the in-
spector the facts about the letter and the cipher.
MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his
great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tan-
gle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going down to Birlstone this morning,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I had come to ask you if you cared to
come with me&#8212;you and your friend here. But
from what you say we might perhaps be doing bet-
ter work in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think not,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!&#8221; cried the inspector.
&#8220;The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in
a day or two; but where&#8217;s the mystery if there is a
man in London who prophesied the crime before
ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands
on that man, and the rest will follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose
to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald turned over the letter which
Holmes had handed him. &#8220;Posted in Camber-
well&#8212;that doesn&#8217;t help us much. Name, you say,
is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn&#8217;t
you say that you have sent him money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In notes to Camberwell post-office.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you ever trouble to see who called for
</p>
<p>them?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
The inspector looked surprised and a little
</p>
<p>shocked. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I always keep faith. I had promised
</p>
<p>when he first wrote that I would not try to trace
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think there is someone behind him?&#8221;
&#8220;I know there is.&#8221;
&#8220;This professor that I&#8217;ve heard you mention?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;
Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid
</p>
<p>quivered as he glanced towards me. &#8220;I won&#8217;t con-
ceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the
C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your
bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries
myself about the matter. He seems to be a very
respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve got so far as to recognize the
talent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, you can&#8217;t but recognize it! After I heard
your view I made it my business to see him. I
had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got
that way I canna think; but he had out a reflec-
tor lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a
minute. He lent me a book; but I don&#8217;t mind say-
ing that it was a bit above my head, though I had
a good Aberdeen upbringing. He&#8217;d have made a
grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair
and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his
hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was
like a father&#8217;s blessing before you go out into the
cold, cruel world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands.
