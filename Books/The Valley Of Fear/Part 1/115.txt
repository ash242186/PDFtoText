</p>
<p>tread of a shoe. It is remarkably broad; a splay-
foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as
one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained
corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole.
However, they are certainly very indistinct. What&#8217;s
this under the side table?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Douglas&#8217;s dumb-bells,&#8221; said Ames.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dumb-bell&#8212;there&#8217;s only one. Where&#8217;s the
other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Mr. Holmes. There may have
been only one. I have not noticed them for
months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One dumb-bell&#8212;&#8221; Holmes said seriously; but
his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at
the door.
</p>
<p>A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-
shaved man looked in at us. I had no difficulty
in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom
I had heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly
with a questioning glance from face to face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to interrupt your consultation,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but you should hear the latest news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An arrest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck. But they&#8217;ve found his bicycle.
The fellow left his bicycle behind him. Come and
have a look. It is within a hundred yards of the
hall door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We found three or four grooms and idlers
standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which
had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens
in which it had been concealed. It was a well used
Rudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a consider-
able journey. There was a saddlebag with spanner
and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a grand help to the police,&#8221; said
the inspector, &#8220;if these things were numbered and
registered. But we must be thankful for what
we&#8217;ve got. If we can&#8217;t find where he went to, at
least we are likely to get where he came from. But
what in the name of all that is wonderful made the
fellow leave it behind? And how in the world has
he got away without it? We don&#8217;t seem to get a
gleam of light in the case, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t we?&#8221; my friend answered thoughtfully.
&#8220;I wonder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
The People Of the Drama
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen all you want of the study?&#8221;
asked White Mason as we reentered the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the time,&#8221; said the inspector, and Holmes
nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you would now like to hear the
evidence of some of the people in the house. We
could use the dining-room, Ames. Please come
yourself first and tell us what you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The butler&#8217;s account was a simple and a clear
one, and he gave a convincing impression of sin-
cerity. He had been engaged five years before,
when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He under-
stood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who
had made his money in America. He had been
a kind and considerate employer&#8212;not quite what
Ames was used to, perhaps; but one can&#8217;t have ev-
erything. He never saw any signs of apprehension
in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most
fearless man he had ever known. He ordered the
</p>
<p>drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it
was the ancient custom of the old house, and he
liked to keep the old ways up.
</p>
<p>Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the
village; but on the day before the crime he had
been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had
observed some restlessness and excitement on the
part of Mr. Douglas that day; for he had seemed
impatient and irritable, which was unusual with
him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in
the pantry at the back of the house, putting away
the silver, when he heard the bell ring violently.
He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he
would, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very
back of the house and there were several closed
doors and a long passage between. The house-
keeper had come out of her room, attracted by the
violent ringing of the bell. They had gone to the
front of the house together.
</p>
<p>683</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>As they reached the bottom of the stair he had
seen Mrs. Douglas coming down it. No, she was
not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was
particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bot-
tom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the
study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged
her to go back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, go back to your room!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Poor Jack is dead! You can do nothing.
For God&#8217;s sake, go back!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs.
Douglas had gone back. She did not scream. She
made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the house-
keeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her
in the bedroom. Ames and Mr. Barker had then re-
turned to the study, where they had found every-
thing exactly as the police had seen it. The candle
was not lit at that time; but the lamp was burn-
ing. They had looked out of the window; but the
night was very dark and nothing could be seen
or heard. They had then rushed out into the hall,
where Ames had turned the windlass which low-
ered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried
off to get the police.
</p>
<p>Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the
butler.
</p>
<p>The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper,
was, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of
her fellow servant. The housekeeper&#8217;s room was
rather nearer to the front of the house than the
pantry in which Ames had been working. She
was preparing to go to bed when the loud ring-
ing of the bell had attracted her attention. She was
a little hard of hearing. Perhaps that was why she
had not heard the shot; but in any case the study
was a long way off. She remembered hearing some
sound which she imagined to be the slamming of
a door. That was a good deal earlier&#8212;half an hour
at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr.
Ames ran to the front she went with him. She
saw Mr. Barker, very pale and excited, come out
of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who
was coming down the stairs. He entreated her to
go back, and she answered him, but what she said
could not be heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take her up! Stay with her!&#8221; he had said to
Mrs. Allen.
</p>
<p>She had therefore taken her to the bedroom,
and endeavoured to soothe her. She was greatly
excited, trembling all over, but made no other at-
tempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dress-
ing gown by her bedroom fire, with her head sunk
in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of
the night. As to the other servants, they had all
</p>
<p>gone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them un-
til just before the police arrived. They slept at the
extreme back of the house, and could not possibly
have heard anything.
</p>
<p>So far the housekeeper could add nothing on
cross-examination save lamentations and expres-
sions of amazement.
</p>
<p>Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness.
As to the occurrences of the night before, he had
very little to add to what he had already told the
police. Personally, he was convinced that the mur-
derer had escaped by the window. The bloodstain
was conclusive, in his opinion, on that point. Be-
sides, as the bridge was up, there was no other
possible way of escaping. He could not explain
what had become of the assassin or why he had
not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He
could not possibly have been drowned in the moat,
which was at no place more than three feet deep.
</p>
<p>In his own mind he had a very definite the-
ory about the murder. Douglas was a reticent
man, and there were some chapters in his life of
which he never spoke. He had emigrated to Amer-
ica when he was a very young man. He had
prospered well, and Barker had first met him in
California, where they had become partners in a
successful mining claim at a place called Benito
Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas
had suddenly sold out and started for England.
He was a widower at that time. Barker had af-
terwards realized his money and come to live in
London. Thus they had renewed their friendship.
</p>
<p>Douglas had given him the impression that
some danger was hanging over his head, and he
had always looked upon his sudden departure
from California, and also his renting a house in
so quiet a place in England, as being connected
with this peril. He imagined that some secret so-
ciety, some implacable organization, was on Dou-
glas&#8217;s track, which would never rest until it killed
him. Some remarks of his had given him this idea;
though he had never told him what the society
was, nor how he had come to offend it. He could
only suppose that the legend upon the placard had
some reference to this secret society.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long were you with Douglas in Califor-
nia?&#8221; asked Inspector MacDonald.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years altogether.&#8221;
&#8220;He was a bachelor, you say?&#8221;
&#8220;A widower.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you ever heard where his first wife came
</p>
<p>from?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I remember his saying that she was of
</p>
<p>German extraction, and I have seen her portrait.
</p>
<p>684</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The People Of the Drama
</p>
<p>She was a very beautiful woman. She died of ty-
phoid the year before I met him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t associate his past with any particu-
lar part of America?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew
that city well and had worked there. I have heard
him talk of the coal and iron districts. He had trav-
elled a good deal in his time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he a politician? Had this secret society to
do with politics?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he cared nothing about politics.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no reason to think it was criminal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I never met a straighter man
in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there anything curious about his life in
California?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He liked best to stay and to work at our claim
in the mountains. He would never go where other
men were if he could help it. That&#8217;s why I first
thought that someone was after him. Then when
he left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it
was so. I believe that he had a warning of some
sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen
men were inquiring for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd.
They came up to the claim and wanted to know
where he was. I told them that he was gone to Eu-
rope and that I did not know where to find him.
They meant him no good&#8212;it was easy to see that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were these men Americans&#8212;Californians?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about Californians. They
were Americans, all right. But they were not min-
ers. I don&#8217;t know what they were, and was very
glad to see their backs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was six years ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearer seven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you were together five years in Cal-
ifornia, so that this business dates back not less
than eleven years at the least?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a very serious feud that would be
kept up with such earnestness for as long as that.
It would be no light thing that would give rise to
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it shadowed his whole life. It was
never quite out of his mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if a man had a danger hanging over him,
and knew what it was, don&#8217;t you think he would
turn to the police for protection?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it was some danger that he could not
be protected against. There&#8217;s one thing you should
know. He always went about armed. His revolver
was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he
was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bed-
room last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess
he thought he was safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like these dates a little clearer,&#8221; said
MacDonald. &#8220;It is quite six years since Douglas
left California. You followed him next year, did
you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so.&#8221;
&#8220;And he had been married five years. You must
</p>
<p>have returned about the time of his marriage.&#8221;
&#8220;About a month before. I was his best man.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her mar-
</p>
<p>riage?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I did not. I had been away from England
</p>
<p>for ten years.&#8221;
&#8220;But you have seen a good deal of her since.&#8221;
Barker looked sternly at the detective. &#8220;I have
</p>
<p>seen a good deal of him since,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;If I
have seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man
without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is
any connection&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to
make every inquiry which can bear upon the case.
But I mean no offense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some inquiries are offensive,&#8221; Barker an-
swered angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the facts that we want. It is in your
interest and everyone&#8217;s interest that they should be
cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve your
friendship with his wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barker grew paler, and his great, strong hands
were clasped convulsively together. &#8220;You have no
right to ask such questions!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What has
this to do with the matter you are investigating?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must repeat the question.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I refuse to answer.&#8221;
&#8220;You can refuse to answer; but you must be
</p>
<p>aware that your refusal is in itself an answer, for
you would not refuse if you had not something to
conceal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barker stood for a moment with his face set
grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low
in intense thought. Then he looked up with a
smile. &#8220;Well, I guess you gentlemen are only do-
ing your clear duty after all, and I have no right
to stand in the way of it. I&#8217;d only ask you not to
worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has
enough upon her just now. I may tell you that
poor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and
</p>
<p>685</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>that was his jealousy. He was fond of me&#8212;no man
could be fonder of a friend. And he was devoted
to his wife. He loved me to come here, and was
forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I
talked together or there seemed any sympathy be-
tween us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass
over him, and he would be off the handle and say-
ing the wildest things in a moment. More than
once I&#8217;ve sworn off coming for that reason, and
then he would write me such penitent, imploring
letters that I just had to. But you can take it from
me, gentlemen, if it was my last word, that no man
ever had a more loving, faithful wife&#8212;and I can
say also no friend could be more loyal than I!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet
Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the sub-
ject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are aware,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that the dead man&#8217;s
wedding ring has been taken from his finger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it appears,&#8221; said Barker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;appears&#8217;? You know it
as a fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man seemed confused and undecided.
&#8220;When I said &#8216;appears&#8217; I meant that it was con-
ceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The mere fact that the ring should be absent,
whoever may have removed it, would suggest to
anyone&#8217;s mind, would it not, that the marriage and
the tragedy were connected?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barker shrugged his broad shoulders. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
profess to say what it means.&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But
if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way
upon this lady&#8217;s honour&#8221;&#8212;his eyes blazed for an
instant, and then with an evident effort he got a
grip upon his own emotions&#8212;&#8220;well, you are on
the wrong track, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve anything else to ask you
at present,&#8221; said MacDonald, coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one small point,&#8221; remarked Sher-
lock Holmes. &#8220;When you entered the room there
was only a candle lighted on the table, was there
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By its light you saw that some terrible incident
had occurred?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You at once rang for help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it arrived very speedily?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Within a minute or so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet when they arrived they found that
the candle was out and that the lamp had been
lighted. That seems very remarkable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Barker showed some signs of indecision.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it was remarkable, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
he answered after a pause. &#8220;The candle threw a
very bad light. My first thought was to get a better
one. The lamp was on the table; so I lit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And blew out the candle?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
Holmes asked no further question, and Barker,
</p>
<p>with a deliberate look from one to the other of us,
which had, as it seemed to me, something of defi-
ance in it, turned and left the room.
</p>
<p>Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to
the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas
in her room; but she had replied that she would
meet us in the dining room. She entered now, a
tall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and
self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very dif-
ferent from the tragic and distracted figure I had
pictured. It is true that her face was pale and
drawn, like that of one who has endured a great
shock; but her manner was composed, and the
finely moulded hand which she rested upon the
edge of the table was as steady as my own. Her
sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other
of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. That
questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into
abrupt speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found anything out yet?&#8221; she asked.
Was it my imagination that there was an under-
</p>
<p>tone of fear rather than of hope in the question?
&#8220;We have taken every possible step, Mrs. Dou-
</p>
<p>glas,&#8221; said the inspector. &#8220;You may rest assured
that nothing will be neglected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare no money,&#8221; she said in a dead, even
tone. &#8220;It is my desire that every possible effort
should be made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can tell us something which may
throw some light upon the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not; but all I know is at your service.&#8221;
&#8220;We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you
</p>
<p>did not actually see&#8212;that you were never in the
room where the tragedy occurred?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he turned me back upon the stairs. He
begged me to return to my room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. You had heard the shot, and you
had at once come down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I put on my dressing gown and then came
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long was it after hearing the shot that
you were stopped on the stair by Mr. Barker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>686</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The People Of the Drama
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may have been a couple of minutes. It is
so hard to reckon time at such a moment. He im-
plored me not to go on. He assured me that I could
do nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led
me upstairs again. It was all like some dreadful
dream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you give us any idea how long your hus-
band had been downstairs before you heard the
shot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot say. He went from his dressing
room, and I did not hear him go. He did the round
of the house every night, for he was nervous of
fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known
him nervous of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just the point which I want to come
to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband
only in England, have you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have been married five years.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you heard him speak of anything which
</p>
<p>occurred in America and might bring some danger
upon him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she an-
swered. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I have always felt
that there was a danger hanging over him. He re-
fused to discuss it with me. It was not from want
of confidence in me&#8212;there was the most complete
love and confidence between us&#8212;but it was out
of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He
thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so
he was silent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know it, then?&#8221;
Mrs. Douglas&#8217;s face lit with a quick smile. &#8220;Can
</p>
<p>a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and
a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it? I
knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes
in his American life. I knew it by certain precau-
tions he took. I knew it by certain words he let
fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected
strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some
powerful enemies, that he believed they were on
his track, and that he was always on his guard
against them. I was so sure of it that for years I
have been terrified if ever he came home later than
was expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I ask,&#8221; asked Holmes, &#8220;what the words
were which attracted your attention?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Valley of Fear,&#8221; the lady answered. &#8220;That
was an expression he has used when I questioned
him. &#8216;I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am not
out of it yet.&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;Are we never to get out of the Val-
ley of Fear?&#8217; I have asked him when I have seen
him more serious than usual. &#8216;Sometimes I think
that we never shall,&#8217; he has answered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you asked him what he meant by the
Valley of Fear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; but his face would become very grave
and he would shake his head. &#8216;It is bad enough
that one of us should have been in its shadow,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;Please God it shall never fall upon you!&#8217; It
was some real valley in which he had lived and in
which something terrible had occurred to him, of
that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he never mentioned any names?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he was delirious with fever once when he
had his hunting accident three years ago. Then I
remember that there was a name that came contin-
ually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort
of horror. McGinty was the name&#8212;Bodymaster
McGinty. I asked him when he recovered who
Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was
master of. &#8216;Never of mine, thank God!&#8217; he an-
swered with a laugh, and that was all I could get
from him. But there is a connection between Body-
master McGinty and the Valley of Fear.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;There is one other point,&#8221; said Inspector Mac-
Donald. &#8220;You met Mr. Douglas in a boarding
house in London, did you not, and became en-
gaged to him there? Was there any romance, any-
thing secret or mysterious, about the wedding?&#8221;
