</p>
<p>by the milk train in the early hours of the morn-
ing. White Mason, the local officer, was a per-
sonal friend, and hence MacDonald had been noti-
fied much more promptly than is usual at Scotland
Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is
a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan ex-
pert is generally asked to run.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Inspector MacDonald [said
the letter which he read to us]:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Official requisition for your services
is in separate envelope. This is for your
private eye. Wire me what train in the
morning you can get for Birlstone, and
I will meet it&#8212;or have it met if I am too
occupied. This case is a snorter. Don&#8217;t
waste a moment in getting started. If
you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do
so; for he will find something after his
own heart. We would think the whole
thing had been fixed up for theatrical
effect if there wasn&#8217;t a dead man in the
middle of it. My word! it is a snorter.&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend seems to be no fool,&#8221; remarked
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I
am any judge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have you anything more?&#8221;
&#8220;Only that he will give us every detail when
</p>
<p>we meet.&#8221;
&#8220;Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the
</p>
<p>fact that he had been horribly murdered?&#8221;
&#8220;That was in the enclosed official report. It
</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t say &#8216;horrible&#8217;: that&#8217;s not a recognized offi-
cial term. It gave the name John Douglas. It men-
tioned that his injuries had been in the head, from
the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the
hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight
last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly
one of murder, but that no arrest had been made,
and that the case was one which presented some
very perplexing and extraordinary features. That&#8217;s
absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, with your permission, we will leave it at
that, Mr. Mac. The temptation to form premature
theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our
profession. I can see only two things for certain at
present&#8212;a great brain in London, and a dead man
in Sussex. It&#8217;s the chain between that we are going
to trace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
The Tragedy of Birlstone
</p>
<p>Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove
my own insignificant personality and to describe
events which occurred before we arrived upon the
scene by the light of knowledge which came to us
afterwards. Only in this way can I make the reader
appreciate the people concerned and the strange
setting in which their fate was cast.
</p>
<p>The village of Birlstone is a small and very
ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the
northern border of the county of Sussex. For cen-
turies it had remained unchanged; but within the
last few years its picturesque appearance and situ-
ation have attracted a number of well-to-do res-
idents, whose villas peep out from the woods
around. These woods are locally supposed to
be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest,
which thins away until it reaches the northern
</p>
<p>chalk downs. A number of small shops have come
into being to meet the wants of the increased pop-
ulation; so there seems some prospect that Birl-
stone may soon grow from an ancient village into
a modern town. It is the centre for a considerable
area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest
place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the
eastward, over the borders of Kent.
</p>
<p>About half a mile from the town, standing in
an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the
ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this ven-
erable building dates back to the time of the first
crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in
the centre of the estate, which had been granted to
him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire
in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner
stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tragedy of Birlstone
</p>
<p>country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal
castle.
</p>
<p>The Manor House, with its many gables and
its small diamond-paned windows, was still much
as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth
century. Of the double moats which had guarded
its more warlike predecessor, the outer had been
allowed to dry up, and served the humble func-
tion of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still
there, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now
only a few feet in depth, round the whole house.
A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so
that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never
ditch-like or unhealthy. The ground floor windows
were within a foot of the surface of the water.
</p>
<p>The only approach to the house was over a
drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had
long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants
of the Manor House had, however, with charac-
teristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge
was not only capable of being raised, but actually
was raised every evening and lowered every morn-
ing. By thus renewing the custom of the old feu-
dal days the Manor House was converted into an
island during the night&#8212;a fact which had a very
direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon
to engage the attention of all England.
</p>
<p>The house had been untenanted for some years
and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque
decay when the Douglases took possession of
it. This family consisted of only two individu-
als&#8212;John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a
remarkable man, both in character and in person.
In age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-
jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, pecu-
liarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure
which had lost nothing of the strength and activ-
ity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but
somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the im-
pression that he had seen life in social strata on
some far lower horizon than the county society of
Sussex.
</p>
<p>Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and
reserve by his more cultivated neighbours, he soon
acquired a great popularity among the villagers,
subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and
attending their smoking concerts and other func-
tions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice,
he was always ready to oblige with an excellent
song. He appeared to have plenty of money, which
was said to have been gained in the California gold
fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that
of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in
America.
</p>
<p>The good impression which had been pro-
duced by his generosity and by his democratic
manners was increased by a reputation gained for
utter indifference to danger. Though a wretched
rider, he turned out at every meet, and took the
most amazing falls in his determination to hold
his own with the best. When the vicarage caught
fire he distinguished himself also by the fearless-
ness with which he reentered the building to save
property, after the local fire brigade had given it
up as impossible. Thus it came about that John
Douglas of the Manor House had within five years
won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.
</p>
<p>His wife, too, was popular with those who had
made her acquaintance; though, after the English
fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in
the county without introductions were few and far
between. This mattered the less to her, as she was
retiring by disposition, and very much absorbed,
to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic
duties. It was known that she was an English lady
who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at
that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman,
tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger
than her husband, a disparity which seemed in no
wise to mar the contentment of their family life.
</p>
<p>It was remarked sometimes, however, by those
who knew them best, that the confidence between
the two did not appear to be complete, since the
wife was either very reticent about her husband&#8217;s
past life, or else, as seemed more likely, was im-
perfectly informed about it. It had also been noted
and commented upon by a few observant people
that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-
strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that
she would display acute uneasiness if her absent
husband should ever be particularly late in his
return. On a quiet countryside, where all gos-
sip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the
Manor House did not pass without remark, and
it bulked larger upon people&#8217;s memory when the
events arose which gave it a very special signifi-
cance.
</p>
<p>There was yet another individual whose resi-
dence under that roof was, it is true, only an inter-
mittent one, but whose presence at the time of the
strange happenings which will now be narrated
brought his name prominently before the pub-
lic. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge,
Hampstead.
</p>
<p>Cecil Barker&#8217;s tall, loose-jointed figure was a
familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village;
for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the
Manor House. He was the more noticed as be-
ing the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr.
</p>
<p>675</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>Douglas who was ever seen in his new English sur-
roundings. Barker was himself an undoubted En-
glishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he
had first known Douglas in America and had there
lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to
be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed
to be a bachelor.
</p>
<p>In age he was rather younger than
Douglas&#8212;forty-five at the most&#8212;a tall, straight,
broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-
fighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a
pair of masterful black eyes which might, even
without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a
way for him through a hostile crowd. He neither
rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering
round the old village with his pipe in his mouth,
or in driving with his host, or in his absence with
his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. &#8220;An
easy-going, free-handed gentleman,&#8221; said Ames,
the butler. &#8220;But, my word! I had rather not be the
man that crossed him!&#8221; He was cordial and inti-
mate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly
with his wife&#8212;a friendship which more than once
seemed to cause some irritation to the husband,
so that even the servants were able to perceive his
annoyance. Such was the third person who was
one of the family when the catastrophe occurred.
</p>
<p>As to the other denizens of the old building,
it will suffice out of a large household to mention
the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs.
Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved
the lady of some of her household cares. The other
six servants in the house bear no relation to the
events of the night of January 6th.
</p>
<p>It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm
reached the small local police station, in charge of
Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Ce-
cil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the
door and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terri-
ble tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and
John Douglas had been murdered. That was the
breathless burden of his message. He had hurried
back to the house, followed within a few minutes
by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of
the crime a little after twelve o&#8217;clock, after taking
prompt steps to warn the county authorities that
something serious was afoot.
</p>
<p>On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant
had found the drawbridge down, the windows
lighted up, and the whole household in a state of
wild confusion and alarm. The white-faced ser-
vants were huddling together in the hall, with the
frightened butler wringing his hands in the door-
way. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of
</p>
<p>himself and his emotions; he had opened the door
which was nearest to the entrance and he had
beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that
moment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and ca-
pable general practitioner from the village. The
three men entered the fatal room together, while
the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels,
closing the door behind him to shut out the terri-
ble scene from the maid servants.
</p>
<p>The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with
outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He
was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which cov-
ered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers
on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and
held down the hand lamp which had stood on
the table. One glance at the victim was enough
to show the healer that his presence could be dis-
pensed with. The man had been horribly injured.
Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a
shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front
of the triggers. It was clear that this had been
fired at close range and that he had received the
whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost
to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so
as to make the simultaneous discharge more de-
structive.
</p>
<p>The country policeman was unnerved and
troubled by the tremendous responsibility which
had come so suddenly upon him. &#8220;We will touch
nothing until my superiors arrive,&#8221; he said in a
hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has been touched up to now,&#8221; said
Cecil Barker. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer for that. You see it all
exactly as I found it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; The sergeant had drawn out
his notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun
to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bed-
room when I heard the report. It was not very
loud&#8212;it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down&#8212;I
don&#8217;t suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in
the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the door open?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as
you see him. His bedroom candle was burning on
the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes
afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see no one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the
stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her
from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the
housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames
</p>
<p>676</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tragedy of Birlstone
</p>
<p>had arrived, and we ran back into the room once
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is
kept up all night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was up until I lowered it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how could any murderer have got away?
It is out of the question! Mr. Douglas must have
shot himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our first idea. But see!&#8221; Barker
drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long,
diamond-paned window was open to its full ex-
tent. &#8220;And look at this!&#8221; He held the lamp down
and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark
of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. &#8220;Someone has
stood there in getting out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that someone waded across the
moat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you were in the room within half a
minute of the crime, he must have been in the wa-
ter at that very moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven
that I had rushed to the window! But the curtain
screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred
to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and
I could not let her enter the room. It would have
been too horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrible enough!&#8221; said the doctor, looking at
the shattered head and the terrible marks which
surrounded it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such injuries since
the Birlstone railway smash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, I say,&#8221; remarked the police sergeant,
whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pon-
dering the open window. &#8220;It&#8217;s all very well your
saying that a man escaped by wading this moat,
but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into the
house at all if the bridge was up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the question,&#8221; said Barker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At what o&#8217;clock was it raised?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nearly six o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Ames, the but-
ler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;that it was
usually raised at sunset. That would be nearer
half-past four than six at this time of year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,&#8221; said Ames.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t raise it until they went. Then I wound
it up myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it comes to this,&#8221; said the sergeant:
&#8220;If anyone came from outside&#8212;if they did&#8212;they
must have got in across the bridge before six and
</p>
<p>been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came
into the room after eleven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house
every night the last thing before he turned in to
see that the lights were right. That brought him in
here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then
he got away through the window and left his gun
behind him. That&#8217;s how I read it; for nothing else
will fit the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside
the dead man on the floor. The initials V. V. and
under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled
in ink upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked, holding it up.
Barker looked at it with curiosity. &#8220;I never no-
</p>
<p>ticed it before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The murderer must have
left it behind him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;V. V.&#8212;341. I can make no sense of that.&#8221;
The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fin-
</p>
<p>gers. &#8220;What&#8217;s V. V.? Somebody&#8217;s initials, maybe.
What have you got there, Dr. Wood?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a good-sized hammer which had been
lying on the rug in front of the fireplace&#8212;a
substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker
pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the
mantelpiece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yester-
day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw him myself, standing upon
that chair and fixing the big picture above it. That
accounts for the hammer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d best put it back on the rug where we
found it,&#8221; said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled
head in his perplexity. &#8220;It will want the best brains
in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will
be a London job before it is finished.&#8221; He raised
the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room.
&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he cried, excitedly, drawing the window
curtain to one side. &#8220;What o&#8217;clock were those cur-
tains drawn?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the lamps were lit,&#8221; said the butler. &#8220;It
would be shortly after four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.&#8221;
He held down the light, and the marks of muddy
boots were very visible in the corner. &#8220;I&#8217;m bound
to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It
looks as if the man got into the house after four
when the curtains were drawn and before six when
the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room,
because it was the first that he saw. There was no
other place where he could hide, so he popped in
behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It
is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house;
but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he
murdered him and escaped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>677</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I read it,&#8221; said Barker. &#8220;But, I say,
aren&#8217;t we wasting precious time? Couldn&#8217;t we start
out and scour the country before the fellow gets
away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sergeant considered for a moment.
&#8220;There are no trains before six in the morning;
</p>
<p>so he can&#8217;t get away by rail. If he goes by road
with his legs all dripping, it&#8217;s odds that someone
will notice him. Anyhow, I can&#8217;t leave here myself
until I am relieved. But I think none of you should
go until we see more clearly how we all stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor had taken the lamp and was nar-
rowly scrutinizing the body. &#8220;What&#8217;s this mark?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Could this have any connection with
the crime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dead man&#8217;s right arm was thrust out from
his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the el-
bow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious
brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing
out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not tattooed,&#8221; said the doctor, peering
through his glasses. &#8220;I never saw anything like it.
The man has been branded at some time as they
brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t profess to know the meaning of it,&#8221;
said Cecil Barker; &#8220;but I have seen the mark on
Douglas many times this last ten years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so have I,&#8221; said the butler. &#8220;Many a time
when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have
noticed that very mark. I&#8217;ve often wondered what
it could be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it has nothing to do with the crime, any-
how,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a rum thing all
</p>
<p>the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well,
what is it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The butler had given an exclamation of aston-
ishment and was pointing at the dead man&#8217;s out-
stretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken his wedding ring!&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain
gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left
hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it was
above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third
finger. There&#8217;s the nugget and there&#8217;s the snake,
but the wedding ring is gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Barker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you tell me,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;that the
wedding ring was below the other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first
took off this ring you call the nugget ring, then the
wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring
back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The worthy country policeman shook his head.
&#8220;Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this
case the better,&#8221; said he. &#8220;White Mason is a smart
man. No local job has ever been too much for
White Mason. It won&#8217;t be long now before he is
here to help us. But I expect we&#8217;ll have to look to
London before we are through. Anyhow, I&#8217;m not
ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the
likes of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
Darkness
</p>
<p>At three in the morning the chief Sussex detec-
tive, obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson
of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light
dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-
forty train in the morning he had sent his message
to Scotland Yard, and he was at the Birlstone sta-
tion at twelve o&#8217;clock to welcome us. White Ma-
son was a quiet, comf
