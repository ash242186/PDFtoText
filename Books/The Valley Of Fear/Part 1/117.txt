</p>
<p>a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose
mind has lost its grip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; I answered in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; he said, and not another
word would he utter that night.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Solution
</p>
<p>Next morning, after breakfast, we found In-
spector MacDonald and White Mason seated in
close consultation in the small parlour of the local
police sergeant. On the table in front of them were
piled a number of letters and telegrams, which
they were carefully sorting and docketing. Three
had been placed on one side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?&#8221;
Holmes asked cheerfully. &#8220;What is the latest news
of the ruffian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of cor-
respondence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is at present reported from Leicester, Not-
tingham, Southampton, Derby, East Ham, Rich-
mond, and fourteen other places. In three of
them&#8212;East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool&#8212;there
is a clear case against him, and he has actually
been arrested. The country seems to be full of the
fugitives with yellow coats.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Holmes sympathetically.
&#8220;Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White Mason, I wish
to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When
I went into this case with you I bargained, as you
will no doubt remember, that I should not present
you with half-proved theories, but that I should re-
tain and work out my own ideas until I had satis-
fied myself that they were correct. For this reason
I am not at the present moment telling you all that
is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I
would play the game fairly by you, and I do not
think it is a fair game to allow you for one un-
necessary moment to waste your energies upon a
profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you
this morning, and my advice to you is summed up
in three words&#8212;abandon the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald and White Mason stared in amaze-
ment at their celebrated colleague.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You consider it hopeless!&#8221; cried the inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider your case to be hopeless. I do not
consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this cyclist. He is not an invention. We
have his description, his valise, his bicycle. The
fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not
get him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no
doubt we shall get him; but I would not have you
waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I
am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a re-
sult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are holding something back. It&#8217;s hardly
fair of you, Mr. Holmes.&#8221; The inspector was an-
noyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But
I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I
only wish to verify my details in one way, which
can very readily be done, and then I make my bow
and return to London, leaving my results entirely
at your service. I owe you too much to act other-
wise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any
more singular and interesting study.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw
you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last
night, and you were in general agreement with our
results. What has happened since then to give you
a completely new idea of the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you
that I would, some hours last night at the Manor
House.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what happened?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, I can only give you a very general answer
</p>
<p>to that for the moment. By the way, I have been
reading a short but clear and interesting account
of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum
of one penny from the local tobacconist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished
with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor
House, from his waistcoat pocket.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Solution
</p>
<p>&#8220;It immensely adds to the zest of an investiga-
tion, my dear Mr. Mac, when one is in conscious
sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one&#8217;s
surroundings. Don&#8217;t look so impatient; for I as-
sure you that even so bald an account as this raises
some sort of picture of the past in one&#8217;s mind. Per-
mit me to give you a sample. &#8216;Erected in the fifth
year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the
site of a much older building, the Manor House of
Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving ex-
amples of the moated Jacobean residence&#8212;&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!&#8212;the first sign of temper I
have detected in you. Well, I won&#8217;t read it verba-
tim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject.
But when I tell you that there is some account of
the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel
in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several
days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of
a visit there by the second George, you will ad-
mit that there are various associations of interest
connected with this ancient house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no
business of ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear
Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profes-
sion. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of
knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You
will excuse these remarks from one who, though a
mere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and
perhaps more experienced than yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the first to admit that,&#8221; said the detective
heartily. &#8220;You get to your point, I admit; but you
have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, I&#8217;ll drop past history and get down
to present-day facts. I called last night, as I have
already said, at the Manor House. I did not see
either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no neces-
sity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that
the lady was not visibly pining and that she had
partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was spe-
cially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I
exchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in
his allowing me, without reference to anyone else,
to sit alone for a time in the study.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! With that?&#8221; I ejaculated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, everything is now in order. You gave
permission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed.
The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed
an instructive quarter of an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a
matter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. It
has always bulked rather large in my estimate of
the case. I ended by finding it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there we come to the edge of the unex-
plored. Let me go a little further, a very little fur-
ther, and I will promise that you shall share every-
thing that I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re bound to take you on your own
terms,&#8221; said the inspector; &#8220;but when it comes to
telling us to abandon the case&#8212;why in the name
of goodness should we abandon the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that
you have not got the first idea what it is that you
are investigating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are investigating the murder of Mr. John
Douglas of Birlstone Manor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, so you are. But don&#8217;t trouble to trace
the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. I as-
sure you that it won&#8217;t help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what do you suggest that we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will
do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m bound to say I&#8217;ve always found you
had reason behind all your queer ways. I&#8217;ll do
what you advise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Mr. White Mason?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The country detective looked helplessly from
one to the other. Holmes and his methods were
new to him. &#8220;Well, if it is good enough for the in-
spector, it is good enough for me,&#8221; he said at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Well, then, I should
recommend a nice, cheery country walk for both
of you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone
Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No
doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry;
though my ignorance of the country prevents me
from recommending one. In the evening, tired but
happy&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, this is getting past a joke!&#8221; cried Mac-
Donald, rising angrily from his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, spend the day as you like,&#8221; said
Holmes, patting him cheerfully upon the shoul-
der. &#8220;Do what you like and go where you will, but
meet me here before dusk without fail&#8212;without
fail, Mr. Mac.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds more like sanity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All of it was excellent advice; but I don&#8217;t in-
sist, so long as you are here when I need you. But
</p>
<p>695</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>now, before we part, I want you to write a note to
Mr. Barker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dictate it, if you like. Ready?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Sir:
&#8220;It has struck me that it is our duty
to drain the moat, in the hope that we
may find some&#8212;&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; said the inspector. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made inquiry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8212;in the hope that we may find
something which may bear upon our
investigation. I have made arrange-
ments, and the workmen will be at
work early to-morrow morning divert-
ing the stream&#8212;&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8212;diverting the stream; so I thought
it best to explain matters beforehand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sign that, and send it by hand about four
o&#8217;clock. At that hour we shall meet again in this
room. Until then we may each do what we like;
for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to
a definite pause.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Evening was drawing in when we reassembled.
Holmes was very serious in his manner, myself cu-
rious, and the detectives obviously critical and an-
noyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen,&#8221; said my friend gravely, &#8220;I
am asking you now to put everything to the
test with me, and you will judge for yourselves
whether the observations I have made justify the
conclusions to which I have come. It is a chill
evening, and I do not know how long our expe-
dition may last; so I beg that you will wear your
warmest coats. It is of the first importance that we
should be in our places before it grows dark; so
with your permission we shall get started at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We passed along the outer bounds of the
Manor House park until we came to a place where
there was a gap in the rails which fenced it.
Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering
gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached
a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main
door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been
</p>
<p>raised. Holmes crouched down behind the screen
of laurels, and we all three followed his example.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what are we to do now?&#8221; asked Mac-
Donald with some gruffness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possess our souls in patience and make as lit-
tle noise as possible,&#8221; Holmes answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we here for at all? I really think that
you might treat us with more frankness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laughed. &#8220;Watson insists that I am the
dramatist in real life,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Some touch of
the artist wells up within me, and calls insistently
for a well-staged performance. Surely our profes-
sion, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if
we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glo-
rify our results. The blunt accusation, the bru-
tal tap upon the shoulder&#8212;what can one make of
such a de&#180;nouement? But the quick inference, the
subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events,
the triumphant vindication of bold theories&#8212;are
these not the pride and the justification of our life&#8217;s
work? At the present moment you thrill with the
glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the
hunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as
definite as a timetable? I only ask a little patience,
Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope the pride and justification and the
rest of it will come before we all get our death of
cold,&#8221; said the London detective with comic resig-
nation.
</p>
<p>We all had good reason to join in the aspiration;
for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the
shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of
the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat
chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chatter-
ing. There was a single lamp over the gateway and
a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Every-
thing else was dark and still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is this to last?&#8221; asked the inspector
finally. &#8220;And what is it we are watching for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no more notion than you how long it is
to last,&#8221; Holmes answered with some asperity. &#8220;If
criminals would always schedule their movements
like railway trains, it would certainly be more con-
venient for all of us. As to what it is we&#8212;Well,
that&#8217;s what we are watching for!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the
study was obscured by somebody passing to and
fro before it. The laurels among which we lay
were immediately opposite the window and not
more than a hundred feet from it. Presently it was
thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we
could dimly see the dark outline of a man&#8217;s head
and shoulders looking out into the gloom. For
</p>
<p>696</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Solution
</p>
<p>some minutes he peered forth in furtive, stealthy
fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he
is unobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the
intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping
of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the
moat with something which he held in his hand.
Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisher-
man lands a fish&#8212;some large, round object which
obscured the light as it was dragged through the
open casement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;Now!&#8221;
We were all upon our feet, staggering after
</p>
<p>him with our stiffened limbs, while he ran swiftly
across the bridge and rang violently at the bell.
There was the rasping of bolts from the other
side, and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance.
Holmes brushed him aside without a word and,
followed by all of us, rushed into the room which
had been occupied by the man whom we had been
watching.
</p>
<p>The oil lamp on the table represented the glow
which we had seen from outside. It was now in the
hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we
entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute,
clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil is the meaning of all this?&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;What are you after, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took a swift glance round, and then
pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with
cord which lay where it had been thrust under the
writing table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what we are after, Mr. Barker&#8212;this
bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you
have just raised from the bottom of the moat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his
face. &#8220;How in thunder came you to know anything
about it?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply that I put it there.&#8221;
&#8220;You put it there! You!&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps I should have said &#8216;replaced it
</p>
<p>there,&#8217; &#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You will remember, Inspec-
tor MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the
absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to
it; but with the pressure of other events you had
hardly the time to give it the consideration which
would have enabled you to draw deductions from
it. When water is near and a weight is missing
it is not a very far-fetched supposition that some-
thing has been sunk in the water. The idea was
at least worth testing; so with the help of Ames,
who admitted me to the room, and the crook of
Dr. Watson&#8217;s umbrella, I was able last night to fish
up and inspect this bundle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was of the first importance, however, that
we should be able to prove who placed it there.
This we accomplished by the very obvious device
of announcing that the moat would be dried to-
morrow, which had, of course, the effect that who-
ever had hidden the bundle would most certainly
withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled
him to do so. We have no less than four witnesses
as to who it was who took advantage of the op-
portunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies
now with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon
the table beside the lamp and undid the cord
which bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-
bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the cor-
ner. Next he drew forth a pair of boots. &#8220;Ameri-
can, as you perceive,&#8221; he remarked, pointing to the
toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,
sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle
of clothing, comprising a complete set of under-
clothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yel-
low overcoat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clothes are commonplace,&#8221; remarked
Holmes, &#8220;save only the overcoat, which is full of
suggestive touches.&#8221; He held it tenderly towards
the light. &#8220;Here, as you perceive, is the inner
pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion
as to give ample space for the truncated fowling
piece. The tailor&#8217;s tab is on the neck&#8212;&#8216;Neal, Out-
fitter, Vermissa, U. S. A.&#8217; I have spent an instruc-
tive afternoon in the rector&#8217;s library, and have en-
larged my knowledge by adding the fact that Ver-
missa is a flourishing little town at the head of
one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the
United States. I have some recollection, Mr. Barker,
that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Dou-
glas&#8217;s first wife, and it would surely not be too far-
fetched an inference that the V. V. upon the card by
the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or
that this very valley which sends forth emissaries
of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we
have heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr.
Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of
your explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a sight to see Cecil Barker&#8217;s expressive
face during this exposition of the great detective.
Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision
swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a
somewhat acrid irony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps
you had better tell us some more,&#8221; he sneered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that I could tell you a great
deal more, Mr. Barker; but it would come with a
better grace from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>697</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say
is that if there&#8217;s any secret here it is not my secret,
and I am not the man to give it away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,&#8221; said the
inspector quietly, &#8220;we must just keep you in sight
until we have the warrant and can hold you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do what you damn please about
that,&#8221; said Barker defiantly.
</p>
<p>The proceedings seemed to have come to a def-
inite end so far as he was concerned; for one had
only to look at that granite face to realize that no
peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead
against his will. The deadlock was broken, how-
ever, by a woman&#8217;s voice. Mrs. Douglas had been
standing listening at the half opened door, and
now she entered the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done enough for now, Cecil,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;Whatever comes of it in the future, you have
done enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough and more than enough,&#8221; remarked
Sherlock Holmes gravely. &#8220;I have every sympa-
thy with you, madam, and should strongly urge
you to have some confidence in the common sense
of our jurisdiction and to take the police volun-
tarily into your complete confidence. It may be
that I am myself at fault for not following up the
hint which you conveyed to me through my friend,
Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason
to believe that you were directly concerned in the
crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At
the same time, there is much that is unexplained,
and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr.
Douglas to tell us his own story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at
Holmes&#8217;s words. The detectives and I must have
echoed it, when we were aware of a man who
seemed to have emerged from the wall, who ad-
vanced now from the gloom of the corner in which
he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in
an instant her arms were round him. Barker had
seized his outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best this way, Jack,&#8221; his wife repeated; &#8220;I
am sure that it is best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes, &#8220;I am sure that you will find it best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man stood blinking at us with the dazed
look of one who comes from the dark into the light.
It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong,
short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, pro-
jecting chin, and a humorous mouth. He took a
good look at us all, and then to my amazement he
advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you,&#8221; said he in a voice which
was not quite English and not quite American, but
was altogether mellow and pleasing. &#8220;You are the
historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you&#8217;ve
never had such a story as that pass through your
hands before, and I&#8217;ll lay my last dollar on that.
Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and
you can&#8217;t miss the public so long as you have those.
I&#8217;ve been cooped up two days, and I&#8217;ve spent the
daylight hours&#8212;as much daylight as I could get
in that rat trap&#8212;in putting the thing into words.
You&#8217;re welcome to them&#8212;you and your public.
There&#8217;s the story of the Valley of Fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the past, Mr. Douglas,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes quietly. &#8220;What we desire now is to hear
your story of the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have it, sir,&#8221; said Douglas. &#8220;May I
smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes.
You&#8217;re a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and
you&#8217;ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days
with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the
smell will give you away.&#8221; He leaned against the
mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes
had handed him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you, Mr. Holmes.
I never guessed that I should meet you. But be-
fore you are through with that,&#8221; he nodded at my
papers, &#8220;you will say I&#8217;ve brought you something
fresh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the
newcomer with the greatest amazement. &#8220;Well,
this fairly beats me!&#8221; he cried at last. &#8220;If you are
Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose
death have we been investigating for these two
days, and where in the world have you sprung
from now? You seemed to me to come out of the
floor like a jack-in-a-box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Mac,&#8221; said Holmes, shaking a reprov-
ing forefinger, &#8220;you would not read that excel-
lent local compilation which described the conceal-
ment of King Charles. People did not hide in those
days without excellent hiding places, and the hid-
ing place that has once been used may be again.
I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr.
Douglas under this roof.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how long have you been playing this
trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; said the inspector an-
grily. &#8220;How long have you allowed us to waste
ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an
absurd one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last
night did I form my views of the case. As they
could not be put to the proof until this evening, I
invited you and your colleague to take a holiday
for the day. Pray what more could I do? When I
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Solution
</p>
<p>found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at once be-
came apparent to me that the body we had found
could not have been the body of Mr. John Douglas
at all, but must be that of the bicyclist from Tun-
bridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible.
Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Dou-
glas himself could be, and the balance of probabil-
ity was that with the connivance of his wife and
his friend he was concealed in a house which had
such conveniences for a fugitive, and awaiting qui-
eter times when he could make his final escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you figured it out about right,&#8221; said
Douglas approvingly. &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d dodge your
British law; for I was not sure how I stood un-
der it, and also I saw my chance to throw these
hounds once for all off my track. Mind you, from
first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of,
and nothing that I would not do again; but you&#8217;ll
judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story.
Never mind warning me, Inspector: I&#8217;m ready to
stand pat upon the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to begin at the beginning. That&#8217;s
all there,&#8221; he indicated my bundle of papers, &#8220;and
a mighty queer yarn you&#8217;ll find it. It all comes
down to this: That there are some men that have
good cause to hate me and would give their last
dollar to know that they had got me. So long as
I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in
this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago
to California, then they chased me out of Amer-
ica; but when I married and settled down in this
quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be
peaceable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never explained to my wife how things were.
Why should I pull her into it? She would never
have a quiet moment again; but would always be
imagining trouble. I fancy she knew something,
for I may have dropped a word here or a word
there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had
seen her, she never knew the rights of the mat-
ter. She told you all she knew, and so did Barker
here; for on the night when this thing happened
there was mighty little time for explanations. She
knows everything now, and I would have been a
wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it was a
hard question, dear,&#8221; he took her hand for an in-
stant in his own, &#8220;and I acted for the best.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, the day before these hap-
penings I was over in Tunbridge Wells, and I got
a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only a
glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things,
and I never doubted who it was. It was the worst
enemy I had among them all&#8212;one who has been
after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these
</p>
<p>years. I knew there was trouble coming, and I
came home and made ready for it. I guessed I&#8217;d
fight through it all right on my own, my luck was
a proverb in the States about &#8217;76. I never doubted
that it would be with me still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on my guard all that next day, and never
went out into the park. It&#8217;s as well, or he&#8217;d have
had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his
before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge
was up&#8212;my mind was always more restful when
that bridge was up in the evenings&#8212;I put the thing
clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his get-
ting into the house and waiting for me. But when
I made my round in my dressing gown, as was
my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I
scented danger. I guess when a man has had dan-
gers in his life&#8212;and I&#8217;ve had more than most in
my time&#8212;there is a kind of sixth sense that waves
the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and
yet I couldn&#8217;t tell you why. Next instant I spotted
a boot under the window curtain, and then I saw
why plain enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just the one candle that was in my hand;
but there was a good light from the hall lamp
through the open door. I put down the candle and
jumped for a hammer that I&#8217;d left on the mantel.
At the same moment he sprang at me. I saw the
glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the ham-
mer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled
down on the floor. He dodged round the table as
quick as an eel, and a moment later he&#8217;d got his
gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I
had got hold of it before he could fire. I had it by
the barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a
minute or more. It was death to the man that lost
his grip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He never lost his grip; but he got it butt down-
ward for a moment too long. Maybe it was I that
pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it off be-
tween us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face,
and there I was, staring down at all that was left
of Ted Baldwin. I&#8217;d recognized him in the town-
ship, and again when he sprang for me; but his
own mother wouldn&#8217;t recognize him as I saw him
then. I&#8217;m used to rough work; but I fairly turned
sick at the sight of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hanging on the side of the table when
Barker came hurrying down. I heard my wife com-
ing, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was
no sight for a woman. I promised I&#8217;d come to her
soon. I said a word or two to Barker&#8212;he took it all
in at a glance&#8212;and we waited for the rest to come
along. But there was no sign of them. Then we un-
derstood that they could hear nothing, and that all
that had happened was known only to ourselves.
</p>
<p>699</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was at that instant that the idea came to me.
I was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it. The
man&#8217;s sleeve had slipped up and there was the
branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man whom we had known as Douglas
turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown
triangle within a circle exactly like that which we
had seen upon the dead man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the sight of that which started me on it.
I seemed to see it all clear at a glance. There were
his height and hair and figure, about the same as
my own. No one could swear to his face, poor
devil! I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a
quarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dress-
ing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We
tied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted
them with the only weight I could find and put
them through the window. The card he had meant
to lay upon my body was lying beside his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My rings were put on his finger; but when it
came to the wedding ring,&#8221; he held out his mus-
cular hand, &#8220;you can see for yourselves that I had
struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I
was married, and it would have taken a file to get it
off. I don&#8217;t know, anyhow, that I should have cared
to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn&#8217;t. So
we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself.
On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down
and put it where I am wearing one myself at this
instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever
as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that
plaster you would have found no cut underneath
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low
for a while and then get away where I could be
joined by my &#8216;widow&#8217; we should have a chance
at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives.
These devils would give me no rest so long as I
was above ground; but if they saw in the papers
that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an
end of all my troubles. I hadn&#8217;t much time to make
it all clear to Barker and to my wife; but they un-
derstood enough to be able to help me. I knew all
about this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never
entered his head to connect it with the matter. I
</p>
<p>retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the
rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he
did. He opened the window and made the mark
on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer es-
caped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge
was up there was no other way. Then, when ev-
erything was fixed, he rang the bell for all he was
worth. What happened afterward you know. And
so, gentlemen, you can do what you please; but
I&#8217;ve told you the truth and the whole truth, so help
me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand by
the English law?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a silence which was broken by Sher-
lock Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The English law is in the main a just law. You
will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr.
Douglas. But I would ask you how did this man
know that you lived here, or how to get into your
house, or where to hide to get you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing of this.&#8221;
Holmes&#8217;s face was very white and grave. &#8220;The
</p>
<p>story is not over yet, I fear,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You may find
worse dangers than the English law, or even than
your enemies from America. I see trouble before
you, Mr. Douglas. You&#8217;ll take my advice and still
be on your guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask
you to come away with me for a time, far from
the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also
from the year of grace in which we made our
eventful journey which ended with the strange
story of the man who had been known as John
Douglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty
years in time, and westward some thousands of
miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular
and terrible narrative&#8212;so singular and so terrible
that you may find it hard to believe that even as I
tell it, even so did it occur.
</p>
<p>Do not think that I intrude one story before an-
other is finished. As you read on you will find that
this is not so. And when I have detailed those dis-
tant events and you have solved this mystery of the
past, we shall meet once more in those rooms on
Baker Street, where this, like so many other won-
derful happenings, will find its end.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
The Man
</p>
<p>It was the fourth of February in the year 1875.
It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay
deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.
The steam ploughs had, however, kept the rail-
road open, and the evening train which connects
the long line of coal-mining and iron-working set-
tlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep
gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain
to Vermissa, the central township which lies at
the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point
the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing,
Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of
Merton. It was a single-track railroad; but at ev-
ery siding&#8212;and they were numerous&#8212;long lines
of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the
hidden wealth which had brought a rude popula-
tion and a bustling life to this most desolate corner
of the United States of America.
</p>
<p>For desolate it was! Little could the first pi-
oneer who had traversed it have ever imagined
that the fairest prairies and the most lush water
pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy
land of black crag and tangled forest. Above the
dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon
their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the moun-
tains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon
each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous val-
ley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly
crawling.
</p>
<p>The oil lamps had just been lit in the lead-
ing passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which
some twenty or thirty people were seated. The
greater number of these were workmen returning
from their day&#8217;s toil in the lower part of the val-
ley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and
the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed
themselves miners. These sat smoking in a group
and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally
at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose
uniforms and badges showed them to be police-
men.
</p>
<p>Several women of the labouring class and one
or two travellers who might have been small lo-
cal storekeepers made up the rest of the company,
with the exception of one young man in a corner
by himself. It is with this man that we are con-
cerned. Take a good look at him, for he is worth
it.
</p>
<p>He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized
young man, not far, one would guess, from his
thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous
</p>
<p>gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to
time as he looks round through his spectacles at
the people about him. It is easy to see that he is
of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anx-
ious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick
him at once as gregarious in his habits and com-
municative in his nature, with a quick wit and a
ready smile. And yet the man who studied him
more closely might discern a certain firmness of
jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would
warn him that there were depths beyond, and that
this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might
conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon
any society to which he was introduced.
</p>
<p>Having made one or two tentative remarks to
the nearest miner, and receiving only short, gruff
replies, the traveller resigned himself to unconge-
nial silence, staring moodily out of the window at
the fading landscape.
</p>
<p>It was not a cheering prospect. Through the
growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the
furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps
of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each
side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering
above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden
houses, the windows of which were beginning to
outline themselves in light, were scattered here
and there along the line, and the frequent halt-
ing places were crowded with their swarthy inhab-
itants.
</p>
<p>The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa dis-
trict were no resorts for the leisured or the cul-
tured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the
crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done,
and the rude, strong workers who did it.
</p>
<p>The young traveller gazed out into this dismal
country with a face of mingled repulsion and inter-
est, which showed that the scene was new to him.
At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter
to which he referred, and on the margins of which
he scribbled some notes. Once from the back of
his waist he produced something which one would
hardly have expected to find in the possession of
so mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver
of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to
the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper
shells within the drum showed that it was fully
loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket,
but not before it had been observed by a working
man who had seated himself upon the adjoining
bench.
