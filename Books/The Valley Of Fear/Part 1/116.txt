</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a beautiful woman&#8212;a very beautiful
woman,&#8221; said MacDonald thoughtfully, after the
door had closed behind her. &#8220;This man Barker has
certainly been down here a good deal. He is a
man who might be attractive to a woman. He ad-
mits that the dead man was jealous, and maybe he
knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy.
Then there&#8217;s that wedding ring. You can&#8217;t get past
that. The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead
man&#8217;s&#8212;What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend had sat with his head upon his
hands, sunk in the deepest thought. Now he rose
and rang the bell. &#8220;Ames,&#8221; he said, when the but-
ler entered, &#8220;where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see, sir.&#8221;
He came back in a moment to say that Barker
</p>
<p>was in the garden.
&#8220;Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>had on his feet last night when you joined him in
the study?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom
slippers. I brought him his boots when he went for
the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the slippers now?&#8221;
&#8220;They are still under the chair in the hall.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good, Ames. It is, of course, important
</p>
<p>for us to know which tracks may be Mr. Barker&#8217;s
and which from outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slip-
pers were stained with blood&#8212;so indeed were my
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is natural enough, considering the con-
dition of the room. Very good, Ames. We will ring
if we want you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later we were in the study.
Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers
from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of
both were dark with blood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange!&#8221; murmured Holmes, as he stood
in the light of the window and examined them
minutely. &#8220;Very strange indeed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces,
he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the
sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in silence
at his colleagues.
</p>
<p>The inspector was transfigured with excite-
ment. His native accent rattled like a stick upon
railings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;there&#8217;s not a doubt of it!
Barker has just marked the window himself. It&#8217;s a
good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that
you said it was a splay-foot, and here&#8217;s the expla-
nation. But what&#8217;s the game, Mr. Holmes&#8212;what&#8217;s
the game?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, what&#8217;s the game?&#8221; my friend repeated
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat
hands together in his professional satisfaction. &#8220;I
said it was a snorter!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;And a real snorter
it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
A Dawning Light
</p>
<p>The three detectives had many matters of de-
tail into which to inquire; so I returned alone to
our modest quarters at the village inn. But before
doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world
garden which flanked the house. Rows of very an-
cient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it
round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with
an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so
soothing and restful that it was welcome to my
somewhat jangled nerves.
</p>
<p>In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could
</p>
<p>forget, or remember only as some fantastic night-
mare, that darkened study with the sprawling,
bloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I
strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its
gentle balm, a strange incident occurred, which
brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinis-
ter impression in my mind.
</p>
<p>I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled
the garden. At the end farthest from the house
they thickened into a continuous hedge. On the
other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes
</p>
<p>688</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Dawning Light
</p>
<p>of anyone approaching from the direction of the
house, there was a stone seat. As I approached
the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the
deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of
feminine laughter.
</p>
<p>An instant later I had come round the end of
the hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and
the man Barker before they were aware of my pres-
ence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the
dining-room she had been demure and discreet.
Now all pretense of grief had passed away from
her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and
her face still quivered with amusement at some re-
mark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands
clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an an-
swering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an
instant&#8212;but it was just one instant too late&#8212;they
resumed their solemn masks as my figure came
into view. A hurried word or two passed between
them, and then Barker rose and came towards me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but am I addressing
Dr. Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare
say, very plainly the impression which had been
produced upon my mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that it was probably you, as your
friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well
known. Would you mind coming over and speak-
ing to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly
I could see in my mind&#8217;s eye that shattered fig-
ure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the
tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laugh-
ing together behind a bush in the garden which
had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve. I had
grieved with her grief in the dining-room. Now I
met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that you think me callous and hard-
hearted,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;It is no business of
mine,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If
you only realized&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need why Dr. Watson should real-
ize,&#8221; said Barker quickly. &#8220;As he has himself said,
it is no possible business of his.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and so I will beg leave to re-
sume my walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment, Dr. Watson,&#8221; cried the woman
in a pleading voice. &#8220;There is one question which
you can answer with more authority than anyone
</p>
<p>else in the world, and it may make a very great dif-
ference to me. You know Mr. Holmes and his re-
lations with the police better than anyone else can.
Supposing that a matter were brought confiden-
tially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary
that he should pass it on to the detectives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Barker eagerly. &#8220;Is he on
his own or is he entirely in with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know that I should be justified
in discussing such a point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg&#8212;I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I
assure you that you will be helping us&#8212;helping
me greatly if you will guide us on that point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was such a ring of sincerity in the
woman&#8217;s voice that for the instant I forgot all about
her levity and was moved only to do her will.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;He is his own master, and would act as
his own judgment directed. At the same time, he
would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials
who were working on the same case, and he would
not conceal from them anything which would help
them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this
I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr.
Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So saying I raised my hat and went upon my
way, leaving them still seated behind that conceal-
ing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far
end of it, and saw that they were still talking very
earnestly together, and, as they were gazing after
me, it was clear that it was our interview that was
the subject of their debate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish none of their confidences,&#8221; said
Holmes, when I reported to him what had oc-
curred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the
Manor House in consultation with his two col-
leagues, and returned about five with a ravenous
appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for
him. &#8220;No confidences, Watson; for they are mighty
awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and
murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it will come to that?&#8221;
He was in his most cheerful and debonair hu-
</p>
<p>mour. &#8220;My dear Watson, when I have extermi-
nated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in
touch with the whole situation. I don&#8217;t say that we
have fathomed it&#8212;far from it&#8212;but when we have
traced the missing dumb-bell&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dumb-bell!&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have
</p>
<p>not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon
the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need not
be downcast; for between ourselves I don&#8217;t think
that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local
</p>
<p>689</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>practitioner has grasped the overwhelming impor-
tance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson!
Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to
yourself the unilateral development, the imminent
danger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson,
shocking!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat with his mouth full of toast and his
eyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intel-
lectual entanglement. The mere sight of his excel-
lent appetite was an assurance of success, for I had
very clear recollections of days and nights with-
out a thought of food, when his baffled mind had
chafed before some problem while his thin, eager
features became more attenuated with the asceti-
cism of complete mental concentration. Finally he
lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old
village inn he talked slowly and at random about
his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as
one who makes a considered statement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A lie, Watson&#8212;a great, big, thumping, obtru-
sive, uncompromising lie&#8212;that&#8217;s what meets us
on the threshold! There is our starting point. The
whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker&#8217;s
story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore
she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a con-
spiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why
are they lying, and what is the truth which they are
trying so hard to conceal? Let us try, Watson, you
and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct
the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know that they are lying? Because it
is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be
true. Consider! According to the story given to us,
the assassin had less than a minute after the mur-
der had been committed to take that ring, which
was under another ring, from the dead man&#8217;s fin-
ger, to replace the other ring&#8212;a thing which he
would surely never have done&#8212;and to put that
singular card beside his victim. I say that this was
obviously impossible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may argue&#8212;but I have too much respect
for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will
do so&#8212;that the ring may have been taken before
the man was killed. The fact that the candle had
been lit only a short time shows that there had
been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from
what we hear of his fearless character, a man who
would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such
short notice, or could we conceive of his giving it
up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone
with the dead man for some time with the lamp
lit. Of that I have no doubt at all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the gunshot was apparently the cause of
death. Therefore the shot must have been fired
</p>
<p>some time earlier than we are told. But there could
be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are
in the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspir-
acy upon the part of the two people who heard
the gunshot&#8212;of the man Barker and of the woman
Douglas. When on the top of this I am able to show
that the blood mark on the windowsill was delib-
erately placed there by Barker, in order to give a
false clue to the police, you will admit that the case
grows dark against him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour
the murder actually did occur. Up to half-past ten
the servants were moving about the house; so it
was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to
eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the
exception of Ames, who was in the pantry. I have
been trying some experiments after you left us this
afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDon-
ald can make in the study can penetrate to me in
the pantry when the doors are all shut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is otherwise, however, from the house-
keeper&#8217;s room. It is not so far down the corridor,
and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it
was very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun
is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at
very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this in-
stance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the si-
lence of the night it should have easily penetrated
to Mrs. Allen&#8217;s room. She is, as she has told us,
somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned
in her evidence that she did hear something like a
door slamming half an hour before the alarm was
given. Half an hour before the alarm was given
would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that
what she heard was the report of the gun, and that
this was the real instant of the murder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is so, we have now to determine what
Barker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming that they are
not the actual murderers, could have been doing
from quarter to eleven, when the sound of the
shot brought them down, until quarter past eleven,
when they rang the bell and summoned the ser-
vants. What were they doing, and why did they
not instantly give the alarm? That is the question
which faces us, and when it has been answered
we shall surely have gone some way to solve our
problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced myself,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that there is
an understanding between those two people. She
must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some
jest within a few hours of her husband&#8217;s murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even
in her own account of what occurred. I am not
a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you
are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has
</p>
<p>690</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Dawning Light
</p>
<p>taught me that there are few wives, having any re-
gard for their husbands, who would let any man&#8217;s
spoken word stand between them and that hus-
band&#8217;s dead body. Should I ever marry, Watson, I
should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling
which would prevent her from being walked off by
a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a
few yards of her. It was badly stage-managed; for
even the rawest investigators must be struck by the
absence of the usual feminine ululation. If there
had been nothing else, this incident alone would
have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my
mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think then, definitely, that Barker and
Mrs. Douglas are guilty of the murder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an appalling directness about your
questions, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, shaking his pipe
at me. &#8220;They come at me like bullets. If you put
it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth
about the murder, and are conspiring to conceal it,
then I can give you a whole-souled answer. I am
sure they do. But your more deadly proposition
is not so clear. Let us for a moment consider the
difficulties which stand in the way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will suppose that this couple are united
by the bonds of a guilty love, and that they have
determined to get rid of the man who stands be-
tween them. It is a large supposition; for discreet
inquiry among servants and others has failed to
corroborate it in any way. On the contrary, there
is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were
very attached to each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, I am sure, cannot he true.&#8221; said I, think-
ing of the beautiful smiling face in the garden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well at least they gave that impression. How-
ever, we will suppose that they are an extraordi-
narily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon
this point, and conspire to murder the husband.
He happens to be a man over whose head some
danger hangs&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have only their word for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked thoughtful. &#8220;I see, Watson. You
are sketching out a theory by which everything
they say from the beginning is false. According
to your idea, there was never any hidden men-
ace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss
MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a
good sweeping generalization. Let us see what
that brings us to. They invent this theory to ac-
count for the crime. They then play up to the idea
by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the
existence of some outsider. The stain on the win-
dowsill conveys the same idea. So does the card on
</p>
<p>the body, which might have been prepared in the
house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson.
But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncom-
promising bits which won&#8217;t slip into their places.
Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons&#8212;and an
American one at that? How could they be so sure
that the sound of it would not bring someone on
to them? It&#8217;s a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen
did not start out to inquire for the slamming door.
Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess that I can&#8217;t explain it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire
to murder a husband, are they going to advertise
their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding
ring after his death? Does that strike you as very
probable, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it does not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And once again, if the thought of leaving a
bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you,
would it really have seemed worth doing when the
dullest detective would naturally say this is an ob-
vious blind, as the bicycle is the first thing which
the fugitive needed in order to make his escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can conceive of no explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet there should be no combination of
events for which the wit of man cannot conceive
an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise, with-
out any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a
possible line of thought. It is, I admit, mere imagi-
nation; but how often is imagination the mother of
truth?
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will suppose that there was a guilty secret,
a really shameful secret in the life of this man Dou-
glas. This leads to his murder by someone who is,
we will suppose, an avenger, someone from out-
side. This avenger, for some reason which I con-
fess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead
man&#8217;s wedding ring. The vendetta might conceiv-
ably date back to the man&#8217;s first marriage, and the
ring be taken for some such reason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before this avenger got away, Barker and the
wife had reached the room. The assassin con-
vinced them that any attempt to arrest him would
lead to the publication of some hideous scandal.
They were converted to this idea, and preferred to
let him go. For this purpose they probably lowered
the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly,
and then raised it again. He made his escape, and
for some reason thought that he could do so more
safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left
his machine where it would not be discovered un-
til he had got safely away. So far we are within the
bounds of possibility, are we not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>691</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is possible, no doubt,&#8221; said I, with
some reserve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to remember, Watson, that what-
ever occurred is certainly something very extraor-
dinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious
case, the couple&#8212;not necessarily a guilty cou-
ple&#8212;realize after the murderer is gone that they
have placed themselves in a position in which it
may be difficult for them to prove that they did
not themselves either do the deed or connive at
it. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situ-
ation. The mark was put by Barker&#8217;s bloodstained
slipper upon the window-sill to suggest how the
fugitive got away. They obviously were the two
who must have heard the sound of the gun; so
they gave the alarm exactly as they would have
done, but a good half hour after the event.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do you propose to prove all this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if there were an outsider, he may be
traced and taken. That would be the most effec-
tive of all proofs. But if not&#8212;well, the resources
of science are far from being exhausted. I think
that an evening alone in that study would help me
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An evening alone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I propose to go up there presently. I have ar-
ranged it with the estimable Ames, who is by no
means whole-hearted about Barker. I shall sit in
that room and see if its atmosphere brings me in-
spiration. I&#8217;m a believer in the genius loci. You
smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall see. By the
way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll borrow that if I may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&#8212;but what a wretched weapon! If
there is danger&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should
certainly ask for your assistance. But I&#8217;ll take the
umbrella. At present I am only awaiting the return
of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where
they are at present engaged in trying for a likely
owner to the bicycle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald
and White Mason came back from their expedi-
tion, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great
advance in our investigation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, I&#8217;ll admeet that I had my doubts if there
was ever an outsider,&#8221; said MacDonald, &#8220;but that&#8217;s
all past now. We&#8217;ve had the bicycle identified, and
we have a description of our man; so that&#8217;s a long
step on our journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I congratulate you both
with all my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Dou-
glas had seemed disturbed since the day before,
when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at
Tunbridge Wells then that he had become con-
scious of some danger. It was clear, therefore,
that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was
from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to
have come. We took the bicycle over with us and
showed it at the hotels. It was identified at once by
the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging
to a man named Hargrave, who had taken a room
there two days before. This bicycle and a small
valise were his whole belongings. He had regis-
tered his name as coming from London, but had
given no address. The valise was London made,
and the contents were British; but the man himself
was undoubtedly an American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Holmes gleefully, &#8220;you have
indeed done some solid work while I have been
sitting spinning theories with my friend! It&#8217;s a les-
son in being practical, Mr. Mac.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it&#8217;s just that, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the inspec-
tor with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this may all fit in with your theories,&#8221; I
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may or may not be. But let us hear the
end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So little that it was evident that he had care-
fully guarded himself against identification. There
were no papers or letters, and no marking upon
the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his
bedroom table. He had left the hotel after break-
fast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more
was heard of him until our inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said
White Mason. &#8220;If the fellow did not want the hue
and cry raised over him, one would imagine that
he would have returned and remained at the hotel
as an inoffensive tourist. As it is, he must know
that he will be reported to the police by the hotel
manager and that his disappearance will be con-
nected with the murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So one would imagine. Still, he has been jus-
tified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since
he has not been taken. But his description&#8212;what
of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald referred to his notebook. &#8220;Here we
have it so far as they could give it. They don&#8217;t seem
to have taken any very particular stock of him; but

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Dawning Light
</p>
<p>still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are
all agreed that this about covers the points. He
was a man about five foot nine in height, fifty or
so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a grayish
moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of
them described as fierce and forbidding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, bar the expression, that might almost be
a description of Douglas himself,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;He is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and mous-
tache, and about the same height. Did you get
anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a
reefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat
and a soft cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the shotgun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is less than two feet long. It could very well
have fitted into his valise. He could have carried it
inside his overcoat without difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do you consider that all this bears
upon the general case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said MacDonald, &#8220;when
we have got our man&#8212;and you may be sure that I
had his description on the wires within five min-
utes of hearing it&#8212;we shall be better able to judge.
But, even as it stands, we have surely gone a long
way. We know that an American calling himself
Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago
with bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-
off shotgun; so he came with the deliberate pur-
pose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for
this place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed
in his overcoat. No one saw him arrive, so far
as we can learn; but he need not pass through
the village to reach the park gates, and there are
many cyclists upon the road. Presumably he at
once concealed his cycle among the laurels where
it was found, and possibly lurked there himself,
with his eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas
to come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to
use inside a house; but he had intended to use it
outside, and there it has very obvious advantages,
as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the
sound of shots is so common in an English sport-
ing neighbourhood that no particular notice would
be taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all very clear,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was
he to do next? He left his bicycle and approached
the house in the twilight. He found the bridge
down and no one about. He took his chance, in-
tending, no doubt, to make some excuse if he met
anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first
room that he saw, and concealed himself behind
</p>
<p>the curtain. Thence he could see the drawbridge
go up, and he knew that his only escape was
through the moat. He waited until quarter-past
eleven, when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly
round came into the room. He shot him and es-
caped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle
would be described by the hotel people and be a
clue against him; so he left it there and made his
way by some other means to London or to some
safe hiding place which he had already arranged.
How is that, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear
so far as it goes. That is your end of the story.
My end is that the crime was committed half an
hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and
Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal some-
thing; that they aided the murderer&#8217;s escape&#8212;or
at least that they reached the room before he es-
caped&#8212;and that they fabricated evidence of his
escape through the window, whereas in all proba-
bility they had themselves let him go by lowering
the bridge. That&#8217;s my reading of the first half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two detectives shook their heads.
&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tum-
</p>
<p>ble out of one mystery into another,&#8221; said the Lon-
don inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And in some ways a worse one,&#8221; added White
Mason. &#8220;The lady has never been in America in all
her life. What possible connection could she have
with an American assassin which would cause her
to shelter him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I freely admit the difficulties,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I
propose to make a little investigation of my own
to-night, and it is just possible that it may con-
tribute something to the common cause.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;No, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson&#8217;s um-
</p>
<p>brella&#8212;my wants are simple. And Ames, the faith-
ful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me.
All my lines of thought lead me back invariably
to the one basic question&#8212;why should an athletic
man develop his frame upon so unnatural an in-
strument as a single dumb-bell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was late that night when Holmes returned
from his solitary excursion. We slept in a double-
bedded room, which was the best that the little
country inn could do for us. I was already asleep
when I was partly awakened by his entrance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Holmes,&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;have you found
anything out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his
hand. Then the tall, lean figure inclined towards
me. &#8220;I say, Watson,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;would you
be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic,

<p>a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose
mind has lost its grip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; I answered in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; he said, and not another
word would he utter that night.

<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Solution
</p>
<p>Next morning, after breakfast, we found In-
spector MacDonald and White Mason seated in
close consultation in the small parlour of the local
police sergeant. On the table in front of them were
piled a number of letters and telegrams, which
they were carefully sorting and docketing. Three
had been placed on one side.
