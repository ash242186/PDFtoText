<p>CHAPTER II.
Sherlock Holmes Discourses
</p>
<p>It was one of those dramatic moments for
which my friend existed. It would be an overstate-
ment to say that he was shocked or even excited
by the amazing announcement. Without having a
tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was
undoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation.
Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual
perceptions were exceedingly active. There was
no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt
at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather
the quiet and interested composure of the chemist
who sees the crystals falling into position from his
oversaturated solution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Remarkable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised.
Why should I be surprised? I receive an anony-
mous communication from a quarter which I know
to be important, warning me that danger threatens
a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this
danger has actually materialized and that the per-
son is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I
am not surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few short sentences he explained to the in-
spector the facts about the letter and the cipher.
MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his
great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tan-
gle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going down to Birlstone this morning,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I had come to ask you if you cared to
come with me&#8212;you and your friend here. But
from what you say we might perhaps be doing bet-
ter work in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think not,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!&#8221; cried the inspector.
&#8220;The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in
a day or two; but where&#8217;s the mystery if there is a
man in London who prophesied the crime before
ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands
on that man, and the rest will follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose
to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald turned over the letter which
Holmes had handed him. &#8220;Posted in Camber-
well&#8212;that doesn&#8217;t help us much. Name, you say,
is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn&#8217;t
you say that you have sent him money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In notes to Camberwell post-office.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you ever trouble to see who called for
</p>
<p>them?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
The inspector looked surprised and a little
</p>
<p>shocked. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I always keep faith. I had promised
</p>
<p>when he first wrote that I would not try to trace
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think there is someone behind him?&#8221;
&#8220;I know there is.&#8221;
&#8220;This professor that I&#8217;ve heard you mention?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;
Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid
</p>
<p>quivered as he glanced towards me. &#8220;I won&#8217;t con-
ceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the
C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your
bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries
myself about the matter. He seems to be a very
respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve got so far as to recognize the
talent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, you can&#8217;t but recognize it! After I heard
your view I made it my business to see him. I
had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got
that way I canna think; but he had out a reflec-
tor lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a
minute. He lent me a book; but I don&#8217;t mind say-
ing that it was a bit above my head, though I had
a good Aberdeen upbringing. He&#8217;d have made a
grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair
and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his
hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was
like a father&#8217;s blessing before you go out into the
cold, cruel world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands.
&#8220;Great!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Great! Tell me, Friend Mac-
Donald, this pleasing and touching interview was,
I suppose, in the professor&#8217;s study?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221;
&#8220;A fine room, is it not?&#8221;
&#8220;Very fine&#8212;very handsome indeed, Mr.
</p>
<p>Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;You sat in front of his writing desk?&#8221;
&#8220;Just so.&#8221;
&#8220;Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp
</p>
<p>was turned on my face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>671</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Valley Of Fear
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be. Did you happen to observe a pic-
ture over the professor&#8217;s head?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I
learned that from you. Yes, I saw the picture&#8212;a
young woman with her head on her hands, peep-
ing at you sideways.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector endeavoured to look interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Baptiste Greuze,&#8221; Holmes continued,
joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his
chair, &#8220;was a French artist who flourished between
the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his
working career. Modern criticism has more than
indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his
contemporaries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector&#8217;s eyes grew abstracted. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t
we better&#8212;&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing so,&#8221; Holmes interrupted. &#8220;All
that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing
upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery.
In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appeal-
ingly to me. &#8220;Your thoughts move a bit too quick
for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,
and I can&#8217;t get over the gap. What in the whole
wide world can be the connection between this
dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All knowledge comes useful to the detective,&#8221;
remarked Holmes. &#8220;Even the trivial fact that in
the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Je-
une Fille a l&#8217;Agneau fetched one million two hun-
dred thousand francs&#8212;more than forty thousand
pounds&#8212;at the Portalis sale may start a train of
reflection in your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was clear that it did. The inspector looked
honestly interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may remind you,&#8221; Holmes continued, &#8220;that
the professor&#8217;s salary can be ascertained in several
trustworthy books of reference. It is seven hun-
dred a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how could he buy&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so! How could he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s remarkable,&#8221; said the inspector
thoughtfully. &#8220;Talk away, Mr. Holmes. I&#8217;m just
loving it. It&#8217;s fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by
genuine admiration&#8212;the characteristic of the real
artist. &#8220;What about Birlstone?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve time yet,&#8221; said the inspector, glancing
at his watch. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a cab at the door, and it won&#8217;t
</p>
<p>take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this
picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes,
that you had never met Professor Moriarty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never have.&#8221;
&#8220;Then how do you know about his rooms?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s another matter. I have been three
</p>
<p>times in his rooms, twice waiting for him un-
der different pretexts and leaving before he came.
Once&#8212;well, I can hardly tell about the once to an
official detective. It was on the last occasion that I
took the liberty of running over his papers&#8212;with
the most unexpected results.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You found something compromising?&#8221;
&#8220;Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed
</p>
<p>me. However, you have now seen the point of the
picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man.
How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His
younger brother is a station master in the west of
England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year.
And he owns a Greuze.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
&#8220;Surely the inference is plain.&#8221;
&#8220;You mean that he has a great income and that
</p>
<p>he must earn it in an illegal fashion?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for
</p>
<p>thinking so&#8212;dozens of exiguous threads which
lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web
where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurk-
ing. I only mention the Greuze because it brings
the matter within the range of your own observa-
tion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say
is interesting: it&#8217;s more than interesting&#8212;it&#8217;s just
wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you
can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary&#8212;where does
the money come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, the name has a familiar sound. Some-
</p>
<p>one in a novel, was he not? I don&#8217;t take much
stock of detectives in novels&#8212;chaps that do things
and never let you see how they do them. That&#8217;s
just inspiration: not business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jonathan Wild wasn&#8217;t a detective, and he
wasn&#8217;t in a novel. He was a master criminal, and
he lived last century&#8212;1750 or thereabouts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s no use to me. I&#8217;m a practical man.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever
</p>
<p>did in your life would be to shut yourself up for
three months and read twelve hours a day at the
annals of crime. Everything comes in circles&#8212;even
Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden
force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his
brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent

</p>
<p>commission. The old wheel turns, and the same
spoke comes up. It&#8217;s all been done before, and
will be again. I&#8217;ll tell you one or two things about
Moriarty which may interest you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll interest me, right enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I happen to know who is the first link in his
chain&#8212;a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at
one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pick-
pockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the
other, with every sort of crime in between. His
chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof
and guarded and inaccessible to the law as him-
self. What do you think he pays him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six thousand a year. That&#8217;s paying for brains,
you see&#8212;the American business principle. I
learned that detail quite by chance. It&#8217;s more than
the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea
of Moriarty&#8217;s gains and of the scale on which he
works. Another point: I made it my business to
hunt down some of Moriarty&#8217;s checks lately&#8212;just
common innocent checks that he pays his house-
hold bills with. They were drawn on six different
banks. Does that make any impression on your
mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he wanted no gossip about his wealth.
No single man should know what he had. I have
no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the
bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank
or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime
when you have a year or two to spare I commend
to you the study of Professor Moriarty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more
impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had
lost himself in his interest. Now his practical
Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap
to the matter in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can keep, anyhow,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes,
Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark
that there is some connection between the profes-
sor and the crime. That you get from the warning
received through the man Porlock. Can we for our
present practical needs get any further than that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may form some conception as to the mo-
tives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your orig-
inal remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unex-
plained, murder. Now, presuming that the source
of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be
two different motives. In the first place, I may tell
you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his
</p>
<p>people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only
one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we
might suppose that this murdered man&#8212;this Dou-
glas whose approaching fate was known by one
of the arch-criminal&#8217;s subordinates&#8212;had in some
way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed,
and would be known to all&#8212;if only to put the fear
of death into them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other is that it has been engineered by
Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was
there any robbery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, it would, of course, be against the first
hypothesis and in favour of the second. Mori-
arty may have been engaged to engineer it on a
promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid
so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But
whichever it may be, or if it is some third combi-
nation, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek
the solution. I know our man too well to suppose
that he has left anything up here which may lead
us to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then to Birlstone we must go!&#8221; cried MacDon-
ald, jumping from his chair. &#8220;My word! it&#8217;s later
than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five
minutes for preparation, and that is all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And ample for us both,&#8221; said Holmes, as he
sprang up and hastened to change from his dress-
ing gown to his coat. &#8220;While we are on our way,
Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell
me all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All about it&#8221; proved to be disappointingly lit-
tle, and yet there was enough to assure us that
the case before us might well be worthy of the ex-
pert&#8217;s closest attention. He brightened and rubbed
his thin hands together as he listened to the mea-
gre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile
weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a
fitting object for those remarkable powers which,
like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner
when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted
and rusted with inaction.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s eyes glistened, his pale
cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager
face shone with an inward light when the call for
work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab,
he listened intently to MacDonald&#8217;s short sketch
of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The
inspector was himself dependent, as he explained
to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him
</p>

<p>by the milk train in the early hours of the morn-
ing. White Mason, the local officer, was a per-
sonal friend, and hence MacDonald had been not
