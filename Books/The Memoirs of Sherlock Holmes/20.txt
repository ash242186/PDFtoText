<p>lancing over the somewhat incoherent
series of Memoirs with which I have en-
deavored to illustrate a few of the men-
tal peculiarities of my friend Mr. Sher-
</p>
<p>lock Holmes, I have been struck by the difficulty
which I have experienced in picking out exam-
ples which shall in every way answer my purpose.
For in those cases in which Holmes has performed
some tour de force of analytical reasoning, and has
demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of
investigation, the facts themselves have often been
so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel
justified in laying them before the public. On the
other hand, it has frequently happened that he has
been concerned in some research where the facts
have been of the most remarkable and dramatic
character, but where the share which he has him-
self taken in determining their causes has been less
pronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish.
The small matter which I have chronicled under
the heading of &#8220;A Study in Scarlet,&#8221; and that other
later one connected with the loss of the Gloria Scott,
may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charyb-
dis which are forever threatening the historian. It
may be that in the business of which I am now
about to write the part which my friend played
is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole
train of circumstances is so remarkable that I can-
not bring myself to omit it entirely from this series.
</p>
<p>It had been a close, rainy day in October. Our
blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled
upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter
which he had received by the morning post. For
myself, my term of service in India had trained me
to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer
of 90 was no hardship. But the paper was uninter-
esting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out
of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New
Forest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank
account had caused me to postpone my holiday,
and as to my companion, neither the country nor
the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.
He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of
people, with his filaments stretching out and run-
ning through them, responsive to every little ru-
mor or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation
of Nature found no place among his many gifts,
and his only change was when he turned his mind
from the evil-doer of the town to track down his
brother of the country.
</p>
<p>Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for con-
versation, I had tossed aside the barren paper, and
leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study.
Suddenly my companion&#8217;s voice broke in upon my
thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It does seem
a very preposterous way of settling a dispute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most preposterous!&#8221; I exclaimed, and then,
suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost
thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared
at him in blank amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, Holmes?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;This is be-
yond anything which I could have imagined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed heartily at my perplexity.
&#8220;You remember,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that some little time
</p>
<p>ago, when I read you the passage in one of Poe&#8217;s
sketches, in which a close reasoner follows the un-
spoken thought of his companion, you were in-
clined to treat the matter as a mere tour de force of
the author. On my remarking that I was constantly
in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed
incredulity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Wat-
</p>
<p>son, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I
saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a
train of thought, I was very happy to have the op-
portunity of reading it off, and eventually of break-
ing into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I was still far from satisfied. &#8220;In the exam-
ple which you read to me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the reasoner
drew his conclusions from the actions of the man
whom he observed. If I remember right, he stum-
bled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars,
and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my
chair, and what clues can I have given you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do yourself an injustice. The features
are given to man as the means by which he shall
express his emotions, and yours are faithful ser-
vants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you read my train of
thoughts from my features?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your features, and especially your eyes. Per-
haps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie
commenced?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I will tell you. After throwing down
</p>
<p>your paper, which was the action which drew my
attention to you, you sat for half a minute with
a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed them-
selves upon your newly-framed picture of General
Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face
that a train of thought had been started. But it
did not lead very far. Your eyes turned across
to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher
which stands upon the top of your books. You
then glanced up at the wall, and of course your
</p>
<p>365</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Resident Patient
</p>
<p>meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if
the portrait were framed it would just cover that
bare space and correspond with Gordon&#8217;s picture
over there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have followed me wonderfully!&#8221; I ex-
claimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far I could hardly have gone astray. But
now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you
looked hard across as if you were studying the
character in his features. Then your eyes ceased
to pucker, but you continued to look across, and
your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the
incidents of Beecher&#8217;s career. I was well aware that
you could not do this without thinking of the mis-
sion which he undertook on behalf of the North
at the time of the Civil War, for I remember you
expressing your passionate indignation at the way
in which he was received by the more turbulent
of our people. You felt so strongly about it that
I knew you could not think of Beecher without
thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw
your eyes wander away from the picture, I sus-
pected that your mind had now turned to the Civil
War, and when I observed that your lips set, your
eyes sparkled, and your hands clinched, I was pos-
itive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry
which was shown by both sides in that desperate
struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder;
you shook your head. You were dwelling upon
the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.
Your hand stole towards your own old wound, and
a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me
that the ridiculous side of this method of settling
international questions had forced itself upon your
mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was
preposterous, and was glad to find that all my de-
ductions had been correct.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221; said I. &#8220;And now that you have
explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as be-
fore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I as-
sure you. I should not have intruded it upon your
attention had you not shown some incredulity the
other day. But the evening has brought a breeze
with it. What do you say to a ramble through Lon-
don?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was weary of our little sitting-room and
gladly acquiesced. For three hours we strolled
about together, watching the ever-changing kalei-
doscope of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet
Street and the Strand. His characteristic talk, with
its keen observance of detail and subtle power of
inference held me amused and enthralled. It was
</p>
<p>ten o&#8217;clock before we reached Baker Street again.
A brougham was waiting at our door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! A doctor&#8217;s&#8212;general practitioner, I per-
ceive,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Not been long in practice,
but has had a good deal to do. Come to consult
us, I fancy! Lucky we came back!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes&#8217;s
methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to
see that the nature and state of the various med-
ical instruments in the wicker basket which hung
in the lamplight inside the brougham had given
him the data for his swift deduction. The light in
our window above showed that this late visit was
indeed intended for us. With some curiosity as
to what could have sent a brother medico to us at
such an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum.
</p>
<p>A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers
rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered. His
age may not have been more than three or four and
thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy
hue told of a life which has sapped his strength
and robbed him of his youth. His manner was
nervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentle-
man, and the thin white hand which he laid on the
mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather
than of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and som-
bre&#8212;a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch
of color about his necktie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, doctor,&#8221; said Holmes, cheerily.
&#8220;I am glad to see that you have only been waiting
a very few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke to my coachman, then?&#8221;
&#8220;No, it was the candle on the side-table that
</p>
<p>told me. Pray resume your seat and let me know
how I can serve you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,&#8221; said our
visitor, &#8220;and I live at 403 Brook Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you not the author of a monograph upon
obscure nervous lesions?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>His pale cheeks flushed with pleasure at hear-
ing that his work was known to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I so seldom hear of the work that I thought it
was quite dead,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My publishers gave me
a most discouraging account of its sale. You are
yourself, I presume, a medical man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A retired army surgeon.&#8221;
&#8220;My own hobby has always been nervous dis-
</p>
<p>ease. I should wish to make it an absolute spe-
cialty, but, of course, a man must take what he can
get at first. This, however, is beside the question,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate how
valuable your time is. The fact is that a very sin-
gular train of events has occurred recently at my
house in Brook Street, and to-night they came to
</p>
<p>366</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>such a head that I felt it was quite impossible for
me to wait another hour before asking for your ad-
vice and assistance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes sat down and lit his pipe.
&#8220;You are very welcome to both,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Pray
let me have a detailed account of what the circum-
stances are which have disturbed you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One or two of them are so trivial,&#8221; said Dr.
Trevelyan, &#8220;that really I am almost ashamed to
mention them. But the matter is so inexplicable,
and the recent turn which it has taken is so elabo-
rate, that I shall lay it all before you, and you shall
judge what is essential and what is not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am compelled, to begin with, to say some-
thing of my own college career. I am a London
University man, you know, and I am sure that you
will not think that I am unduly singing my own
praises if I say that my student career was consid-
ered by my professors to be a very promising one.
After I had graduated I continued to devote myself
to research, occupying a minor position in King&#8217;s
College Hospital, and I was fortunate enough to
excite considerable interest by my research into
the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win the
Bruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the mono-
graph on nervous lesions to which your friend has
just alluded. I should not go too far if I were to say
that there was a general impression at that time
that a distinguished career lay before me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the one great stumbling-block lay in my
want of capital. As you will readily understand,
a specialist who aims high is compelled to start
in one of a dozen streets in the Cavendish Square
quarter, all of which entail enormous rents and
furnishing expenses. Besides this preliminary out-
lay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some
years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse.
To do this was quite beyond my power, and I
could only hope that by economy I might in ten
years&#8217; time save enough to enable me to put up
my plate. Suddenly, however, an unexpected inci-
dent opened up quite a new prospect to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a visit from a gentleman of the name
of Blessington, who was a complete stranger to
me. He came up to my room one morning, and
plunged into business in an instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You are the same Percy Trevelyan who has
had so distinguished a career and won a great
prize lately?&#8217; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Answer me frankly,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;for you
will find it to your interest to do so. You have
</p>
<p>all the cleverness which makes a successful man.
Have you the tact?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not help smiling at the abruptness of
the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I trust that I have my share,&#8217; I said.
&#8220; &#8216;Any bad habits? Not drawn towards drink,
</p>
<p>eh?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Really, sir!&#8217; I cried.
&#8220; &#8216;Quite right! That&#8217;s all right! But I was bound
</p>
<p>to ask. With all these qualities, why are you not in
practice?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shrugged my shoulders.
&#8220; &#8216;Come, come!&#8217; said he, in his bustling way.
</p>
<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s the old story. More in your brains than in your
pocket, eh? What would you say if I were to start
you in Brook Street?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I stared at him in astonishment.
&#8220; &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s for my sake, not for yours,&#8217; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you
it will suit me very well. I have a few thousands to
invest, d&#8217;ye see, and I think I&#8217;ll sink them in you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But why?&#8217; I gasped.
&#8220; &#8216;Well, it&#8217;s just like any other speculation, and
</p>
<p>safer than most.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;What am I to do, then?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you. I&#8217;ll take the house, furnish it,
</p>
<p>pay the maids, and run the whole place. All you
have to do is just to wear out your chair in the
consulting-room. I&#8217;ll let you have pocket-money
and everything. Then you hand over to me three
quarters of what you earn, and you keep the other
quarter for yourself.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the strange proposal, Mr. Holmes,
with which the man Blessington approached me.
I won&#8217;t weary you with the account of how we
bargained and negotiated. It ended in my mov-
ing into the house next Lady-day, and starting in
practice on very much the same conditions as he
had suggested. He came himself to live with me in
the character of a resident patient. His heart was
weak, it appears, and he needed constant medi-
cal supervision. He turned the two best rooms of
the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for
himself. He was a man of singular habits, shun-
ning company and very seldom going out. His life
was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity
itself. Every evening, at the same hour, he walked
into the consulting-room, examined the books, put
down five and three-pence for every guinea that I
had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong-
box in his own room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may say with confidence that he never had
occasion to regret his speculation. From the first it
</p>
<p>367</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Resident Patient
</p>
<p>was a success. A few good cases and the reputa-
tion which I had won in the hospital brought me
rapidly to the front, and during the last few years
I have made him a rich man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much, Mr. Holmes, for my past history and
my relations with Mr. Blessington. It only remains
for me now to tell you what has occurred to bring
me her to-night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some weeks ago Mr. Blessington came down
to me in, as it seemed to me, a state of consider-
able agitation. He spoke of some burglary which,
he said, had been committed in the West End, and
he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessar-
ily excited about it, declaring that a day should
not pass before we should add stronger bolts to
our windows and doors. For a week he contin-
ued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peer-
ing continually out of the windows, and ceasing
to take the short walk which had usually been the
prelude to his dinner. From his manner it struck
me that he was in mortal dread of something or
somebody, but when I questioned him upon the
point he became so offensive that I was compelled
to drop the subject. Gradually, as time passed, his
fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed
his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him
to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now
lies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened was this. Two days ago I re-
ceived the letter which I now read to you. Neither
address nor date is attached to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;A Russian nobleman who is now
resident in England,&#8217; it runs, &#8216;would
be glad to avail himself of the profes-
sional assistance of Dr. Percy Trevelyan.
He has been for some years a victim
to cataleptic attacks, on which, as is
well known, Dr. Trevelyan is an author-
ity. He proposes to call at about quar-
ter past six to-morrow evening, if Dr.
Trevelyan will make it convenient to be
at home.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This letter interest me deeply, because the
chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy is the
rareness of the disease. You may believe, than,
that I was in my consulting-room when, at the ap-
pointed hour, the page showed in the patient.
</p>
<p>He was an elderly man, thin, demure, and
common-place&#8212;by no means the conception one
forms of a Russian nobleman. I was much more
struck by the appearance of his companion. This
was a tall young man, surprisingly handsome,
with a dark, fierce face, and the limbs and chest
</p>
<p>of a Hercules. He had his hand under the other&#8217;s
arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair
with a tenderness which one would hardly have
expected from his appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You will excuse my coming in, doctor,&#8217; said
he to me, speaking English with a slight lisp. &#8216;This
is my father, and his health is a matter of the most
overwhelming importance to me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was touched by this filial anxiety. &#8216;You
would, perhaps, care to remain during the consul-
tation?&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Not for the world,&#8217; he cried with a gesture of
horror. &#8216;It is more painful to me than I can express.
If I were to see my father in one of these dreadful
seizures I am convinced that I should never sur-
vive it. My own nervous system is an exception-
ally sensitive one. With your permission, I will
remain in the waiting-room while you go into my
father&#8217;s case.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To this, of course, I assented, and the young
man withdrew. The patient and I then plunged
into a discussion of his case, of which I took ex-
haustive notes. He was not remarkable for intel-
ligence, and his answers were frequently obscure,
which I attributed to his limited acquaintance with
our language. Suddenly, however, as I sat writing,
he ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries,
and on my turning towards him I was shocked to
see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair,
staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face.
He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My first feeling, as I have just said, was one
of pity and horror. My second, I fear, was rather
one of professional satisfaction. I made notes of
my patient&#8217;s pulse and temperature, tested the
rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes.
There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of
these conditions, which harmonized with my for-
mer experiences. I had obtained good results in
such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and
the present seemed an admirable opportunity of
testing its virtues. The bottle was downstairs in
my laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in his
chair, I ran down to get it. There was some little
delay in finding it&#8212;five minutes, let us say&#8212;and
then I returned. Imagine my amazement to find
the room empty and the patient gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, my first act was to run into the
waiting-room. The son had gone also. The hall
door had been closed, but not shut. My page who
admits patients is a new boy and by no means
quick. He waits downstairs, and runs up to show
patients out when I ring the consulting-room bell.
He had heard nothing, and the affair remained a
</p>
<p>368</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>complete mystery. Mr. Blessington came in from
his walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say any-
thing to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth,
I have got in the way of late of holding as little
communication with him as possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never thought that I should see any-
thing more of the Russian and his son, so you can
imagine my amazement when, at the very same
hour this evening, they both came marching into
my consulting-room, just as they had done before.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I feel that I owe you a great many apologies
for my abrupt departure yesterday, doctor,&#8217; said
my patient.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I confess that I was very much surprised at
it,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, the fact is,&#8217; he remarked, &#8216;that when I
recover from these attacks my mind is always very
clouded as to all that has gone before. I woke up
in a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made
my way out into the street in a sort of dazed way
when you were absent.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And I,&#8217; said the son, &#8216;seeing my father pass
the door of the waiting-room, naturally thought
that the consultation had come to an end. It was
not until we had reached home that I began to re-
alize the true state of affairs.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, laughing, &#8216;there is no harm done
except that you puzzled me terribly; so if you, sir,
would kindly step into the waiting-room I shall
be happy to continue our consultation which was
brought to so abrupt an ending.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For half an hour or so I discussed that old
gentleman&#8217;s symptoms with him, and then, hav-
ing prescribed for him, I saw him go off upon the
arm of his son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you that Mr. Blessington generally
chose this hour of the day for his exercise. He came
in shortly afterwards and passed upstairs. An in-
stant later I heard him running down, and he burst
into my consulting-room like a man who is mad
with panic.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Who has been in my room?&#8217; he cried.
&#8220; &#8216;No one,&#8217; said I.
&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8217; He yelled. &#8216;Come up and look!&#8217;
&#8220;I passed over the grossness of his language, as
</p>
<p>he seemed half out of his mind with fear. When I
went upstairs with him he pointed to several foot-
prints upon the light carpet.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;D&#8217;you mean to say those are mine?&#8217; he cried.
&#8220;They were certainly very much larger than
</p>
<p>any which he could have made, and were evi-
dently quite fresh. It rained hard this afternoon, as
</p>
<p>you know, and my patients were the only people
who called. It must have been the case, then, that
the man in the waiting-room had, for some un-
known reason, while I was busy with the other, as-
cended to the room of my resident patient. Noth-
ing has been touched or taken, but there were the
footprints to prove that the intrusion was an un-
doubted fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blessington seemed more excited over
the matter than I should have thought possible,
though of course it was enough to disturb any-
body&#8217;s peace of mind. He actually sat crying in an
arm-chair, and I could hardly get him to speak co-
herently. It was his suggestion that I should come
round to you, and of course I at once saw the pro-
priety of it, for certainly the incident is a very sin-
gular one, though he appears to completely over-
rate its importance. If you would only come back
with me in my brougham, you would at least be
able to soothe him, though I can hardly hope that
you will be able to explain this remarkable occur-
rence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long nar-
rative with an intentness which showed me that
his interest was keenly aroused. His face was as
impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more
heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled
up more thickly from his pipe to emphasize each
curious episode in the doctor&#8217;s tale. As our visi-
tor concluded, Holmes sprang up without a word,
handed me my hat, picked his own from the table,
and followed Dr. Trevelyan to the door. Within a
quarter of an hour we had been dropped at the
door of the physician&#8217;s residence in Brook Street,
one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one
associates with a West-End practice. A small page
admitted us, and we began at once to ascend the
broad, well-carpeted stair.
</p>
<p>But a singular interruption brought us to a
standstill. The light at the top was suddenly
whisked out, and from the darkness came a reedy,
quivering voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a pistol,&#8221; it cried. &#8220;I give you my word
that I&#8217;ll fire if you come any nearer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This really grows outrageous, Mr. Blessing-
ton,&#8221; cried Dr. Trevelyan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then it is you, doctor,&#8221; said the voice, with
a great heave of relief. &#8220;But those other gentlemen,
are they what they pretend to be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the
darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the voice at last.
&#8220;You can come up, and I am sorry if my precau-
tions have annoyed you.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Resident Patient
</p>
<p>He relit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw
before us a singular-looking man, whose appear-
ance, as well as his voice, testified to his jangled
nerves. He was very fat, but had apparently at
some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung
about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of
a blood-hound. He was of a sickly color, and his
thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the in-
tensity of his emotion. In his hand he held a pistol,
but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am
sure I am very much obliged to you for coming
round. No one ever needed your advice more than
I do. I suppose that Dr. Trevelyan has told you of
this most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Who are these two
men Mr. Blessington, and why do they wish to mo-
lest you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the resident patient, in a ner-
vous fashion, &#8220;of course it is hard to say that. You
can hardly expect me to answer that, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t know?&#8221;
&#8220;Come in here, if you please. Just have the
</p>
<p>kindness to step in here.&#8221;
He led the way into his bedroom, which was
</p>
<p>large and comfortably furnished.
&#8220;You see that,&#8221; said he, pointing to a big black
</p>
<p>box at the end of his bed. &#8220;I have never been a
very rich man, Mr. Holmes&#8212;never made but one
investment in my life, as Dr. Trevelyan would tell
you. But I don&#8217;t believe in bankers. I would never
trust a banker, Mr. Holmes. Between ourselves,
what little I have is in that box, so you can under-
stand what it means to me when unknown people
force themselves into my rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked at Blessington in his question-
ing way and shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot possibly advise you if you try to de-
ceive me,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have told you everything.&#8221;
Holmes turned on his heel with a gesture of
</p>
<p>disgust. &#8220;Good-night, Dr. Trevelyan,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And no advice for me?&#8221; cried Blessington, in
</p>
<p>a breaking voice.
&#8220;My advice to your, sir, is to speak the truth.&#8221;
A minute later we were in the street and walk-
</p>
<p>ing for home. We had crossed Oxford Street and
were half way down Harley Street before I could
get a word from my companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to bring you out on such a fool&#8217;s errand,
Watson,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;It is an interesting case,
too, at the bottom of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make little of it,&#8221; I confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is quite evident that there are two
men&#8212;more, perhaps, but at least two&#8212;who are
determined for some reason to get at this fellow
Blessington. I have no doubt in my mind that both
on the first and on the second occasion that young
man penetrated to Blessington&#8217;s room, while his
confederate, by an ingenious device, kept the doc-
tor from interfering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the catalepsy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fraudulent imitation, Watson, though I
should hardly dare to hint as much to our special-
ist. It is a very easy complaint to imitate. I have
done it myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the purest chance Blessington was out on
each occasion. Their reason for choosing so un-
usual an hour for a consultation was obviously to
insure that there should be no other patient in the
waiting-room. It just happened, however, that this
hour coincided with Blessington&#8217;s constitutional,
which seems to show that they were not very well
acquainted with his daily routine. Of course, if
they had been merely after plunder they would at
least have made some attempt to search for it. Be-
sides, I can read in a man&#8217;s eye when it is his own
skin that he is frightened for. It is inconceivable
that this fellow could have made two such vindic-
tive enemies as these appear to be without know-
ing of it. I hold it, therefore, to be certain that he
does know who these men are, and that for rea-
sons of his own he suppresses it. It is just possible
that to-morrow may find him in a more commu-
nicative mood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there not one alternative,&#8221; I suggested,
&#8220;grotesquely improbably, no doubt, but still just
conceivable? Might the whole story of the catalep-
tic Russian and his son be a concoction of Dr.
Trevelyan&#8217;s, who has, for his own purposes, been
in Blessington&#8217;s rooms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an
amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it was one of the
first solutions which occurred to me, but I was
soon able to corroborate the doctor&#8217;s tale. This
young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet
which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to
see those which he had made in the room. When
I tell you that his shoes were square-toed instead
of being pointed like Blessington&#8217;s, and were quite
an inch and a third longer than the doctor&#8217;s, you
will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to
his individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for
</p>
<p>370</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I shall be surprised if we do not hear something
further from Brook Street in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s prophecy was soon fulfilled,
and in a dramatic fashion. At half-past seven next
morning, in the first glimmer of daylight, I found
him standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,&#8221;
said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, then?&#8221;
&#8220;The Brook Street business.&#8221;
&#8220;Any fresh news?&#8221;
&#8220;Tragic, but ambiguous,&#8221; said he, pulling up
</p>
<p>the blind. &#8220;Look at this&#8212;a sheet from a note-book,
with &#8216;For God&#8217;s sake come at once&#8212;P. T.,&#8217; scrawled
upon it in pencil. Our friend, the doctor, was hard
put to it when he wrote this. Come along, my dear
fellow, for it&#8217;s an urgent call.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour or so we were back at
the physician&#8217;s house. He came running out to
meet us with a face of horror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, such a business!&#8221; he cried, with his hands
to his temples.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;
&#8220;Blessington has committed suicide!&#8221;
Holmes whistled.
&#8220;Yes, he hanged himself during the night.&#8221;
We had entered, and the doctor had preceded
</p>
<p>us into what was evidently his waiting-room.
&#8220;I really hardly know what I am doing,&#8221; he
</p>
<p>cried. &#8220;The police are already upstairs. It has
shaken me most dreadfully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you find it out?&#8221;
&#8220;He has a cup of tea taken in to him early every
</p>
<p>morning. When the maid entered, about seven,
there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the
middle of the room. He had tied his cord to the
hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and
he had jumped off from the top of the very box
that he showed us yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.
&#8220;With your permission,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;I
</p>
<p>should like to go upstairs and look into the mat-
ter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We both ascended, followed by the doctor.
It was a dreadful sight which met us as we en-
</p>
<p>tered the bedroom door. I have spoken of the im-
pression of flabbiness which this man Blessington
conveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was ex-
aggerated and intensified until he was scarce hu-
man in his appearance. The neck was drawn out
</p>
<p>like a plucked chicken&#8217;s, making the rest of him
seem the more obese and unnatural by the con-
trast. He was clad only in his long night-dress, and
his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded
starkly from beneath it. Beside him stood a smart-
looking police-inspector, who was taking notes in
a pocket-book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, heartily, as my
friend entered, &#8220;I am delighted to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Lanner,&#8221; answered Holmes;
&#8220;you won&#8217;t think me an intruder, I am sure. Have
you heard of the events which led up to this af-
fair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard something of them.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you formed any opinion?&#8221;
&#8220;As far as I can see, the man has been driven
</p>
<p>out of his senses by fright. The bed has been
well slept in, you see. There&#8217;s his impression deep
enough. It&#8217;s about five in the morning, you know,
that suicides are most common. That would be
about his time for hanging himself. It seems to
have been a very deliberate affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say that he has been dead about three
hours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,&#8221; said
I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noticed anything peculiar about the room?&#8221;
asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Found a screw-driver and some screws on the
wash-hand stand. Seems to have smoked heavily
during the night, too. Here are four cigar-ends that
I picked out of the fireplace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;have you got his cigar-
holder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have seen none.&#8221;
&#8220;His cigar-case, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, it was in his coat-pocket.&#8221;
Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar
</p>
<p>which it contained.
&#8220;Oh, this is an Havana, and these others are
</p>
<p>cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by
the Dutch from their East Indian colonies. They
are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are
thinner for their length than any other brand.&#8221; He
picked up the four ends and examined them with
his pocket-lens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of these have been smoked from a holder
and two without,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Two have been cut by
a not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends
bitten off by a set of excellent teeth. This is no sui-
cide, Mr. Lanner. It is a very deeply planned and
cold-blooded murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; cried the inspector.
&#8220;And why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>371</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Resident Patient
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should any one murder a man in so
clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we have to find out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could they get in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the front door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was barred in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was barred after them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw their traces. Excuse me a moment, and I
may be able to give you some further information
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went over to the door, and turning the lock
he examined it in his methodical way. Then he
took out the key, which was on the inside, and in-
spected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs
the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were
each in turn examined, until at last he professed
himself satisfied, and with my aid and that of the
inspector cut down the wretched object and laid it
reverently under a sheet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about this rope?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is cut off this,&#8221; said Dr. Trevelyan, drawing a
large coil from under the bed. &#8220;He was morbidly
nervous of fire, and always kept this beside him,
so that he might escape by the window in case the
stairs were burning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That must have saved them trouble,&#8221; said
Holmes, thoughtfully. &#8220;Yes, the actual facts are
very plain, and I shall be surprised if by the af-
ternoon I cannot give you the reasons for them as
well. I will take this photograph of Blessington,
which I see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help
me in my inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have told us nothing!&#8221; cried the doc-
tor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there can be no doubt as to the sequence
of events,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;There were three of
them in it: the young man, the old man, and a
third, to whose identity I have no clue. The first
two, I need hardly remark, are the same who mas-
queraded as the Russian count and his son, so we
can give a very full description of them. They
were admitted by a confederate inside the house.
If I might offer you a word of advice, Inspector, it
would be to arrest the page, who, as I understand,
has only recently come into your service, Doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The young imp cannot be found,&#8221; said Dr.
Trevelyan; &#8220;the maid and the cook have just been
searching for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shou
