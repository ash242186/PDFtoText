<p>am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to
go,&#8221; said Holmes, as we sat down to-
gether to our breakfast one morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go! Where to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Dartmoor; to King&#8217;s Pyland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was not surprised. Indeed, my only won-
der was that he had not already been mixed upon
this extraordinary case, which was the one topic
of conversation through the length and breadth
of England. For a whole day my companion had
rambled about the room with his chin upon his
chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharg-
ing his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and
absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks.
Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up
by our news agent, only to be glanced over and
tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I
knew perfectly well what it was over which he was
brooding. There was but one problem before the
public which could challenge his powers of analy-
sis, and that was the singular disappearance of the
favorite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder
of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly an-
nounced his intention of setting out for the scene
of the drama it was only what I had both expected
and hoped for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be most happy to go down with you
if I should not be in the way,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson, you would confer a great fa-
vor upon me by coming. And I think that your
time will not be misspent, for there are points
about the case which promise to make it an ab-
solutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to
catch our train at Paddington, and I will go fur-
ther into the matter upon our journey. You would
oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent
field-glass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so it happened that an hour or so later
I found myself in the corner of a first-class car-
riage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sher-
lock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in
his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into
the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured
at Paddington. We had left Reading far behind
us before he thrust the last one of them under the
seat, and offered me his cigar-case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going well,&#8221; said he, looking out the
window and glancing at his watch. &#8220;Our rate at
present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,&#8221;
said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this
line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a
</p>
<p>simple one. I presume that you have looked into
this matter of the murder of John Straker and the
disappearance of Silver Blaze?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen what the Telegraph and the Chroni-
cle have to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is one of those cases where the art of the rea-
soner should be used rather for the sifting of de-
tails than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. The
tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and
of such personal importance to so many people,
that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise,
conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to
detach the framework of fact&#8212;of absolute unde-
niable fact&#8212;from the embellishments of theorists
and reporters. Then, having established ourselves
upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what
inferences may be drawn and what are the special
points upon which the whole mystery turns. On
Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both
Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and from
Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case,
inviting my cooperation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuesday evening!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;And this is
Thursday morning. Why didn&#8217;t you go down yes-
terday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I made a blunder, my dear Wat-
son&#8212;which is, I am afraid, a more common occur-
rence than any one would think who only knew
me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could
not believe it possible that the most remarkable
horse in England could long remain concealed,
especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the
north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday
I expected to hear that he had been found, and
that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker.
When, however, another morning had come, and
I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy
Simpson nothing had been done, I felt that it was
time for me to take action. Yet in some ways I feel
that yesterday has not been wasted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have formed a theory, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I have got a grip of the essential facts
of the case. I shall enumerate them to you, for
nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to
another person, and I can hardly expect your co-
operation if I do not show you the position from
which we start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my
cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his
long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon
the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the
events which had led to our journey.
</p>
<p>281</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Silver Blaze
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silver Blaze,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is from the Somomy
stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his fa-
mous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year, and has
brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to
Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time
of the catastrophe he was the first favorite for the
Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on him.
He has always, however, been a prime favorite
with the racing public, and has never yet disap-
pointed them, so that even at those odds enormous
sums of money have been laid upon him. It is
obvious, therefore, that there were many people
who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver
Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next
Tuesday.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact was, of course, appreciated at King&#8217;s
Pyland, where the Colonel&#8217;s training-stable is situ-
ated. Every precaution was taken to guard the fa-
vorite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey
who rode in Colonel Ross&#8217;s colors before he be-
came too heavy for the weighing-chair. He has
served the Colonel for five years as jockey and
for seven as trainer, and has always shown him-
self to be a zealous and honest servant. Under
him were three lads; for the establishment was a
small one, containing only four horses in all. One
of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while
the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent
characters. John Straker, who is a married man,
lived in a small villa about two hundred yards
from the stables. He has no children, keeps one
maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The coun-
try round is very lonely, but about half a mile to
the north there is a small cluster of villas which
have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the
use of invalids and others who may wish to en-
joy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two
miles to the west, while across the moor, also about
two miles distant, is the larger training establish-
ment of Mapleton, which belongs to Lord Backwa-
ter, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other
direction the moor is a complete wilderness, in-
habited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was
the general situation last Monday night when the
catastrophe occurred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On that evening the horses had been exercised
and watered as usual, and the stables were locked
up at nine o&#8217;clock. Two of the lads walked up to
the trainer&#8217;s house, where they had supper in the
kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained
on guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid,
Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his sup-
per, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton.
She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the
stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty
</p>
<p>should drink nothing else. The maid carried a
lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path
ran across the open moor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the
stables, when a man appeared out of the dark-
ness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into
the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she
saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing,
dressed in a gray suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap.
He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a
knob to it. She was most impressed, however, by
the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervous-
ness of his manner. His age, she thought, would
be rather over thirty than under it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Can you tell me where I am?&#8217; he asked. &#8216;I
had almost made up my mind to sleep on the
moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You are close to the King&#8217;s Pyland training-
stables,&#8217; said she.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!&#8217; he cried.
&#8216;I understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone
every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you
are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would
not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress,
would you?&#8217; He took a piece of white paper folded
up out of his waistcoat pocket. &#8216;See that the boy
has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest
frock that money can buy.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was frightened by the earnestness of his
manner, and ran past him to the window through
which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It
was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the
small table inside. She had begun to tell him of
what had happened, when the stranger came up
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Good-evening,&#8217; said he, looking through the
window. &#8216;I wanted to have a word with you.&#8217; The
girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the cor-
ner of the little paper packet protruding from his
closed hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What business have you here?&#8217; asked the lad.
&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s business that may put something into
</p>
<p>your pocket,&#8217; said the other. &#8216;You&#8217;ve two horses
in for the Wessex Cup&#8212;Silver Blaze and Bayard.
Let me have the straight tip and you won&#8217;t be a
loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could
give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs,
and that the stable have put their money on him?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;So, you&#8217;re one of those damned touts!&#8217; cried
the lad. &#8216;I&#8217;ll show you how we serve them in King&#8217;s
Pyland.&#8217; He sprang up and rushed across the sta-
ble to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the
house, but as she ran she looked back and saw
that the stranger was leaning through the window.
</p>
<p>282</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out
with the hound he was gone, and though he ran
all round the buildings he failed to find any trace
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Did the stable-boy,
when he ran out with the dog, leave the door un-
locked behind him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson, excellent!&#8221; murmured my
companion. &#8220;The importance of the point struck
me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dart-
moor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy
locked the door before he left it. The window, I
may add, was not large enough for a man to get
through.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had re-
turned, when he sent a message to the trainer and
told him what had occurred. Straker was excited
at hearing the account, although he does not seem
to have quite realized its true significance. It left
him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker,
waking at one in the morning, found that he was
dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said that
he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about
the horses, and that he intended to walk down to
the stables to see that all was well. She begged
him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain
pattering against the window, but in spite of her
entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and
left the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning,
to find that her husband had not yet returned. She
dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off
for the stables. The door was open; inside, hud-
dled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in
a state of absolute stupor, the favorite&#8217;s stall was
empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting
loft above the harness-room were quickly aroused.
They had heard nothing during the night, for they
are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously
under the influence of some powerful drug, and
as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to
sleep it off while the two lads and the two women
ran out in search of the absentees. They still had
hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken
out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending
the knoll near the house, from which all the neigh-
boring moors were visible, they not only could see
no signs of the missing favorite, but they perceived
something which warned them that they were in
the presence of a tragedy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About a quarter of a mile from the stables
John Straker&#8217;s overcoat was flapping from a furze-
bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-
</p>
<p>shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom
of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate
trainer. His head had been shattered by a sav-
age blow from some heavy weapon, and he was
wounded on the thigh, where there was a long,
clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp
instrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had
defended himself vigorously against his assailants,
for in his right hand he held a small knife, which
was clotted with blood up to the handle, while
in his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat,
which was recognized by the maid as having been
worn on the preceding evening by the stranger
who had visited the stables. Hunter, on recover-
ing from his stupor, was also quite positive as to
the ownership of the cravat. He was equally cer-
tain that the same stranger had, while standing at
the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so
deprived the stables of their watchman. As to the
missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the
mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow
that he had been there at the time of the struggle.
But from that morning he has disappeared, and al-
though a large reward has been offered, and all the
gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has
come of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that
the remains of his supper left by the stable-lad con-
tain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium,
while the people at the house partook of the same
dish on the same night without any ill effect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the main facts of the case, stripped
of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. I
shall now recapitulate what the police have done
in the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has
been committed, is an extremely competent officer.
Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise
to great heights in his profession. On his arrival
he promptly found and arrested the man upon
whom suspicion naturally rested. There was lit-
tle difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited one
of those villas which I have mentioned. His name,
it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man
of excellent birth and education, who had squan-
dered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now
by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in
the sporting clubs of London. An examination of
his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of
five thousand pounds had been registered by him
against the favorite. On being arrested he volun-
teered that statement that he had come down to
Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information
about the King&#8217;s Pyland horses, and also about
Desborough, the second favorite, which was in
charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables. He
</p>
<p>283</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Silver Blaze
</p>
<p>did not attempt to deny that he had acted as de-
scribed upon the evening before, but declared that
he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished
to obtain first-hand information. When confronted
with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was ut-
terly unable to account for its presence in the hand
of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed
that he had been out in the storm of the night be-
fore, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer
weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as
might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the ter-
rible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed.
On the other hand, there was no wound upon his
person, while the state of Straker&#8217;s knife would
show that one at least of his assailants must bear
his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nut-
shell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I
shall be infinitely obliged to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had listened with the greatest interest to the
statement which Holmes, with characteristic clear-
ness, had laid before me. Though most of the facts
were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreci-
ated their relative importance, nor their connection
to each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is in not possible,&#8221; I suggested, &#8220;that the in-
cised wound upon Straker may have been caused
by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which
follow any brain injury?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is more than possible; it is probable,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;In that case one of the main points in
favor of the accused disappears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said I, &#8220;even now I fail to under-
stand what the theory of the police can be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that whatever theory we state has
very grave objections to it,&#8221; returned my compan-
ion. &#8220;The police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy
Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in
some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the
stable door and took out the horse, with the in-
tention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether.
His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have
put this on. Then, having left the door open be-
hind him, he was leading the horse away over the
moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the
trainer. A row naturally ensued. Simpson beat out
the trainer&#8217;s brains with his heavy stick without
receiving any injury from the small knife which
Straker used in self-defence, and then the thief ei-
ther led the horse on to some secret hiding-place,
or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and
be now wandering out on the moors. That is the
case as it appears to the police, and improbable as
it is, all other explanations are more improbable
</p>
<p>still. However, I shall very quickly test the mat-
ter when I am once upon the spot, and until then
I cannot really see how we can get much further
than our present position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evening before we reached the little
town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a
shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dart-
moor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the sta-
tion&#8212;the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair
and beard and curiously penetrating light blue
eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat
and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim
little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter
was Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the
other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly
making his name in the English detective service.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted that you have come down, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;The Inspector here
has done all that could possibly be suggested, but
I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to
avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have there been any fresh developments?&#8221;
asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say that we have made very lit-
tle progress,&#8221; said the Inspector. &#8220;We have an open
carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like
to see the place before the light fails, we might talk
it over as we drive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute later we were all seated in a comfort-
able landau, and were rattling through the quaint
old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was full
of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,
while Holmes threw in an occasional question or
interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his
arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while
I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two
detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory,
which was almost exactly what Holmes had fore-
told in the train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy
Simpson,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;and I believe myself that
he is our man. At the same time I recognize
that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that
some new development may upset it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Straker&#8217;s knife?&#8221;
&#8220;We have quite come to the conclusion that he
</p>
<p>wounded himself in his fall.&#8221;
&#8220;My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to
</p>
<p>me as we came down. If so, it would tell against
this man Simpson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any
sign of a wound. The evidence against him is cer-
tainly very strong. He had a great interest in the
</p>
<p>284</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>disappearance of the favorite. He lies under sus-
picion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was
undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with
a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead
man&#8217;s hand. I really think we have enough to go
before a jury.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head. &#8220;A clever counsel
would tear it all to rags,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why should
he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished
to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a
duplicate key been found in his possession? What
chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all,
where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a
horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own
explanation as to the paper which he wished the
maid to give to the stable-boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says that it was a ten-pound note. One
was found in his purse. But your other difficul-
ties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not
a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at
Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably
brought from London. The key, having served its
purpose, would be hurled away. The horse may be
at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon
the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he say about the cravat?&#8221;
&#8220;He acknowledges that it is his, and declares
</p>
<p>that he had lost it. But a new element has been in-
troduced into the case which may account for his
leading the horse from the stable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes pricked up his ears.
&#8220;We have found traces which show that a party
</p>
<p>of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a
mile of the spot where the murder took place. On
Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that
there was some understanding between Simpson
and these gypsies, might he not have been lead-
ing the horse to them when he was overtaken, and
may they not have him now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly possible.&#8221;
&#8220;The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I
</p>
<p>have also examined every stable and out-house in
Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is another training-stable quite close, I
understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and that is a factor which we must cer-
tainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse,
was second in the betting, they had an interest in
the disappearance of the favorite. Silas Brown, the
trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the
event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. We
have, however, examined the stables, and there is
nothing to connect him with the affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And nothing to connect this man Simpson
with the interests of the Mapleton stables?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the
conversation ceased. A few minutes later our
driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with
overhanging eaves which stood by the road. Some
distance off, across a paddock, lay a long gray-
tiled out-building. In every other direction the low
curves of the moor, bronze-colored from the fad-
ing ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken
only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a clus-
ter of houses away to the westward which marked
the Mapleton stables. We all sprang out with the
exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back
with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him,
entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only
when I touched his arm that he roused himself
with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said he, turning to Colonel Ross,
who had looked at him in some surprise. &#8220;I was
day-dreaming.&#8221; There was a gleam in his eyes and
a suppressed excitement in his manner which con-
vinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his
hand was upon a clue, though I could not imag-
ine where he had found it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to
the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; said Gregory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I should prefer to stay here a little
and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker
was brought back here, I presume?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-
morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been in your service some years,
Colonel Ross?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always found him an excellent servant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume that you made an inventory of what
he had in this pockets at the time of his death, In-
spector?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the things themselves in the sitting-
room, if you would care to see them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad.&#8221; We all filed into the
front room and sat round the central table while
the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid
a small heap of things before us. There was a box
of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A D P
brier-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half an
ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a
gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminum
pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled
knife with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked
Weiss &amp; Co., London.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Silver Blaze
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very singular knife,&#8221; said Holmes,
lifting it up and examining it minutely. &#8220;I pre-
sume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the
one which was found in the dead man&#8217;s grasp.
Watson, this knife is surely in your line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what we call a cataract knife,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I thought so. A very delicate blade devised
</p>
<p>for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man
to carry with him upon a rough expedition, espe-
cially as it would not shut in his pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which
we found beside his body,&#8221; said the Inspector.
&#8220;His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the
dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he
left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps
the best that he could lay his hands on at the mo-
ment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very possible. How about these papers?&#8221;
&#8220;Three of them are receipted hay-dealers&#8217; ac-
</p>
<p>counts. One of them is a letter of instructions from
Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner&#8217;s account for
thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame
Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire.
Mrs. Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend
of her husband&#8217;s and that occasionally his letters
were addressed here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive
tastes,&#8221; remarked Holmes, glancing down the ac-
count. &#8220;Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a
single costume. However there appears to be noth-
ing more to learn, and we may now go down to the
scene of the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we emerged from the sitting-room a
woman, who had been waiting in the passage,
took a step forward and laid her hand upon the
Inspector&#8217;s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin
and eager, stamped with the print of a recent hor-
ror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got them? Have you found them?&#8221;
she panted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has
come from London to help us, and we shall do all
that is possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-
party some little time ago, Mrs. Straker?&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; you are mistaken.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You
</p>
<p>wore a costume of dove-colored silk with ostrich-
feather trimming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had such a dress, sir,&#8221; answered the
lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that quite settles it,&#8221; said Holmes. And
with an apology he followed the Inspector outside.
A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow
in which the body had been found. At the brink
of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had
been hung.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no wind that night, I understand,&#8221;
said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None; but very heavy rain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case the overcoat was not blown
against the furze-bush, but placed there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was laid across the bush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You fill me with interest, I perceive that the
ground has been trampled up a good deal. No
doubt many feet have been here since Monday
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A piece of matting has been laid here at the
side, and we have all stood upon that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this bag I have one of the boots which
Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson&#8217;s shoes, and
a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!&#8221;
Holmes took the bag, and, descending into the hol-
low, he pushed the matting into a more central
position. Then stretching himself upon his face
and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a
careful study of the trampled mud in front of him.
&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said he, suddenly. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; It was
a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with
mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot think how I came to overlook it,&#8221; said
the Inspector, with an expression of annoyance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw
it because I was looking for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You expected to find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it not unlikely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took the boots from the bag, and compared
the impressions of each of them with marks upon
the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of
the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns
and bushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that there are no more tracks,&#8221; said
the Inspector. &#8220;I have examined the ground very
carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Holmes, rising. &#8220;I should not
have the impertinence to do it again after what you
say. But I should like to take a little walk over the
moor before it grows dark, that I may know my
ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this
horseshoe into my pocket for luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>286</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of
impatience at my companion&#8217;s quiet and system-
atic method of work, glanced at his watch. &#8220;I wish
you would come back with me, Inspector,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;There are several points on which I should
like your advice, and especially as to whether we
do not owe it to the public to remove our horse&#8217;s
name from the entries for the Cup.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; cried Holmes, with decision.
&#8220;I should let the name stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel bowed. &#8220;I am very glad to have
had your opinion, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You will find us at
poor Straker&#8217;s house when you have finished your
walk, and we can drive together into Tavistock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned back with the Inspector, while
Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. The
sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of
Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front
of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich,
ruddy browns where the faded ferns and bram-
bles caught the evening light. But the glories of
the landscape were all wasted upon my compan-
ion, who was sunk in the deepest thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, Watson,&#8221; said he at last. &#8220;We
may leave the question of who killed John Straker
for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding
out what has become of the horse. Now, suppos-
ing that he broke away during or after the tragedy,
where could he have gone to? The horse is a very
gregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts
would have been either to return to King&#8217;s Pyland
or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild
upon the moor? He would surely have been seen
by now. And why should gypsies kidnap him?
These people always clear out when they hear of
trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the
police. They could not hope to sell such a horse.
They would run a great risk and gain nothing by
taking him. Surely that is clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he, then?&#8221;
&#8220;I have already said that he must have gone
</p>
<p>to King&#8217;s Pyland or to Mapleton. He is not at
King&#8217;s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let
us take that as a working hypothesis and see what
it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspec-
tor remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls
away towards Mapleton, and you can see from
here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which
must have been very wet on Monday night. If
our supposition is correct, then the horse must
have crossed that, and there is the point where we
should look for his tracks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had been walking briskly during this con-
versation, and a few more minutes brought us
</p>
<p>to the hollow in question. At Holmes&#8217; request I
walked down the bank to the right, and he to the
left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard
him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to
me. The track of a horse was plainly outlined in
the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which
he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impres-
sion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See the value of imagination,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;It is the one quality which Gregory lacks. We
imagined what might have happened, acted upon
the supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let
us proceed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over
a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. Again the
ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks.
Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick
them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was
Holmes who saw them first, and he stood point-
ing with a look of triumph upon his face. A man&#8217;s
track was visible beside the horse&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The horse was alone before,&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is
</p>
<p>this?&#8221;
The double track turned sharp off and took the
</p>
<p>direction of King&#8217;s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and
we both followed along after it. His eyes were on
the trail, but I happened to look a little to one side,
and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming
back again in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One for you, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, when I
pointed it out. &#8220;You have saved us a long walk,
which would have brought us back on our own
traces. Let us follow the return track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of
asphalt which led up to the gates of the Mapleton
stables. As we approached, a groom ran out from
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any loiterers about here,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wished to ask a question,&#8221; said Holmes,
with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket.
&#8220;Should I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas
Brown, if I were to call at five o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be,
for he is always the first stirring. But here he is, sir,
to answer your questions for himself. No, sir, no;
it is as much as my place is worth to let him see
me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown
which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-
looking elderly man strode out from the gate with
a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.
</p>
<p>287</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Silver Blaze
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Dawson!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;No gossip-
ing! Go about your business! And you, what the
devil do you want here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten minutes&#8217; talk with you, my good sir,&#8221; said
Holmes in the sweetest of voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We
want no stranger here. Be off, or you may find a
dog at your heels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned forward and whispered some-
thing in the trainer&#8217;s ear. He started violently and
flushed to the temples.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;an infernal lie!&#8221;
&#8220;Very good. Shall we argue about it here in
</p>
<p>public or talk it over in your parlor?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, come in if you wish to.&#8221;
Holmes smiled. &#8220;I shall not keep you more
</p>
<p>than a few minutes, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now, Mr.
Brown, I am quite at your disposal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all
faded into grays before Holmes and the trainer
reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as
had been brought about in Silas Brown in that
short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspi-
ration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook
until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the
wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all
gone too, and he cringed along at my companion&#8217;s
side like a dog with its master.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your instructions will be done. It shall all be
done,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be no mistake,&#8221; said Holmes,
looking round at him. The other winced as he read
the menace in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be
there. Should I change it first or not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes thought a little and then burst out
laughing. &#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I shall write to
you about it. No tricks, now, or&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from
</p>
<p>me to-morrow.&#8221; He turned upon his heel, disre-
garding the trembling hand which the other held
out to him, and we set off for King&#8217;s Pyland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A more perfect compound of the bully, cow-
ard, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have sel-
dom met with,&#8221; remarked Holmes as we trudged
along together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has the horse, then?&#8221;
&#8220;He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to
</p>
<p>him so exactly what his actions had been upon that
morning that he is convinced that I was watching
</p>
<p>him. Of course you observed the peculiarly square
toes in the impressions, and that his own boots ex-
actly corresponded to them. Again, of course no
subordinate would have dared to do such a thing.
I described to him how, when according to his cus-
tom he was the first down, he perceived a strange
horse wandering over the moor. How he went out
to it, and his astonishment at recognizing, from
the white forehead which has given the favorite its
name, that chance had put in his power the only
horse which could beat the one upon which he had
put his money. Then I described how his first im-
pulse had been to lead him back to King&#8217;s Pyland,
and how the devil had shown him how he could
hide the horse until the race was over, and how
he had led it back and concealed it at Mapleton.
When I told him every detail he gave it up and
thought only of saving his own skin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But his stables had been searched?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and old horse-fakir like him has many a
dodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his
power now, since he has every interest in injuring
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple
of his eye. He knows that his only hope of mercy
is to produce it safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man
who would be likely to show much mercy in any
case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I
follow my own methods, and tell as much or as
little as I choose. That is the advantage of being
unofficial. I don&#8217;t know whether you observed it,
Watson, but the Colonel&#8217;s manner has been just a
trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have
a little amusement at his expense. Say nothing to
him about the horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not without your permission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course this is all quite a minor point
compared to the question of who killed John
Straker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will devote yourself to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, we both go back to London
by the night train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was thunderstruck by my friend&#8217;s words. We
had only been a few hours in Devonshire, and that
he should give up an investigation which he had
begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to
me. Not a word more could I draw from him until
we were back at the trainer&#8217;s house. The Colonel
and the Inspector were awaiting us in the parlor.
</p>
<p>288</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;My friend and I return to town by the night-
express,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;We have had a charming
little breath of your beautiful Dartmoor air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Inspector opened his eyes, and the
Colonel&#8217;s lip curled in a sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you despair of arresting the murderer of
poor Straker,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;There are
certainly grave difficulties in the way,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
have every hope, however, that your horse will
start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have
your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photo-
graph of Mr. John Straker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Inspector took one from an envelope and
handed it to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants.
If I might ask you to wait here for an instant, I have
a question which I should like to put to the maid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say that I am rather disappointed
in our London consultant,&#8221; said Colonel Ross,
bluntly, as my friend left the room. &#8220;I do not see
that we are any further than when he came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least you have his assurance that your
horse will run,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have his assurance,&#8221; said the Colonel,
with a shrug of his shoulders. &#8220;I should prefer to
have the horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was about to make some reply in defence of
my friend when he entered the room again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am quite ready
for Tavistock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we stepped into the carriage one of the
stable-lads held the door open for us. A sudden
idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned for-
ward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a few sheep in the paddock,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Who attends to them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you noticed anything amiss with them
of late?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, not of much account; but three of
them have gone lame, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased,
for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,&#8221; said
he, pinching my arm. &#8220;Gregory, let me recom-
mend to your attention this singular epidemic
among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Ross still wore an expression which
showed the poor opinion which he had formed
</p>
<p>of my companion&#8217;s ability, but I saw by the In-
spector&#8217;s face that his attention had been keenly
aroused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You consider that to be important?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exceedingly so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any point to which you would wish to
draw my attention?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the curious incident of the dog in the night-
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog did nothing in the night-time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the curious incident,&#8221; remarked
Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>Four days later Holmes and I were again in the
train, bound for Winchester to see the race for the
Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met us by appointment
outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the
course beyond the town. His face was grave, and
his manner was cold in the extreme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen nothing of my horse,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that you would know him when
you saw him?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>The Colonel was very angry. &#8220;I have been on
the turf for twenty years, and never was asked
such a question as that before,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A child
would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead
and his mottled off-foreleg.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the betting?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is the curious part of it. You could
have got fifteen to one yesterday, but the price has
become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly
get three to one now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Somebody knows
something, that is clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the
grand stand I glanced at the card to see the entries.
</p>
<p>1. Mr. Heath Newton&#8217;s The Negro. Red cap.
Cinnamon jacket.
</p>
<p>2. Colonel Wardlaw&#8217;s Pugilist. Pink cap. Blue
and black jacket.
</p>
<p>3. Lord Backwater&#8217;s Desborough. Yellow cap
and sleeves.
</p>
<p>4. Colonel Ross&#8217;s Silver Blaze. Black cap. Red

</p>
<p>5. Duke of Balmoral&#8217;s Iris. Yellow and black
stripes.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Silver Blaze
</p>
<p>&#8220;We scratched our other one, and put all hopes
on your word,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;Why, what is
that? Silver Blaze favorite?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five to four against Silver Blaze!&#8221; roared the
ring. &#8220;Five to four against Silver Blaze! Five to
fifteen against Desborough! Five to four on the
field!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the numbers up,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;They are
all six there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All six there? Then my horse is running,&#8221;
cried the Colonel in great agitation. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
see him. My colors have not passed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only five have passed. This must be he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out
from the weighting enclosure and cantered past
us, bearing on its back the well-known black and
red of the Colonel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not my horse,&#8221; cried the owner. &#8220;That
beast has not a white hair upon its body. What is
this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, let us see how he gets on,&#8221; said
my friend, imperturbably. For a few minutes he
gazed through my field-glass. &#8220;Capital! An ex-
cellent start!&#8221; he cried suddenly. &#8220;There they are,
coming round the curve!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From our drag we had a superb view as they
came up the straight. The six horses were so
close together that a carpet could have covered
them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton
stable showed to the front. Before they reached
us, however, Desborough&#8217;s bolt was shot, and the
Colonel&#8217;s horse, coming away with a rush, passed
the post a good six lengths before its rival, the
Duke of Balmoral&#8217;s Iris making a bad third.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my race, anyhow,&#8221; gasped the Colonel,
passing his hand over his eyes. &#8220;I confess that I can
make neither head nor tail of it. Don&#8217;t you think
that you have kept up your mystery long enough,
Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything.
Let us all go round and have a look at the horse to-
gether. Here he is,&#8221; he continued, as we made our
way into the weighing enclosure, where only own-
ers and their friends find admittance. &#8220;You have
only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine,
and you will find that he is the same old Silver
Blaze as ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You take my breath away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found him in the hands of a fakir, and took
the liberty of running him just as he was sent
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir, you have done wonders. The
horse looks very fit and well. It never went bet-
ter in its life. I owe you a thousand apologies for
having doubted your ability. You have done me a
great service by recovering my horse. You would
do me a greater still if you could lay your hands
on the murderer of John Straker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done so,&#8221; said Holmes quietly.
The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got him! Where is he, then?&#8221;
&#8220;He is here.&#8221;
&#8220;Here! Where?&#8221;
&#8220;In my company at the present moment.&#8221;
The Colonel flushed angrily. &#8220;I quite recognize
</p>
<p>that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but I must regard what you have just said
as either a very bad joke or an insult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. &#8220;I assure you that I
have not associated you with the crime, Colonel,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;The real murderer is standing immedi-
ately behind you.&#8221; He stepped past and laid his
hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The horse!&#8221; cried both the Colonel and myself.
&#8220;Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I
</p>
<p>say that it was done in self-defence, and that John
Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of
your confidence. But there goes the bell, and as I
stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer
a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves
that evening as we whirled back to London, and I
fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel
Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our
companion&#8217;s narrative of the events which had oc-
curred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the
Monday night, and the means by which he had
unravelled them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that any theories which I
had formed from the newspaper reports were en-
tirely erroneous. And yet there were indications
there, had they not been overlaid by other details
which concealed their true import. I went to De-
vonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson
was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that
the evidence against him was by no means com-
plete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as
we reached the trainer&#8217;s house, that the immense
significance of the curried mutton occurred to me.
You may remember that I was distrait, and re-
mained sitting after you had all alighted. I was
marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly
have overlooked so obvious a clue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;that even now I
cannot see how it helps us.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;It was the first link in my chain of reasoning.
Powdered opium is by no means tasteless. The fla-
vor is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were
it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would
undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no
more. A curry was exactly the medium which
would disguise this taste. By no possible suppo-
sition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have
caused curry to be served in the trainer&#8217;s family
that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coinci-
dence to suppose that he happened to come along
with powdered opium upon the very night when a
dish happened to be served which would disguise
the flavor. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson
becomes eliminated from the case, and our atten-
tion centers upon Straker and his wife, the only
two people who could have chosen curried mut-
ton for supper that night. The opium was added
after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for
the others had the same for supper with no ill ef-
fects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish
without the maid seeing them?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before deciding that question I had grasped
the significance of the silence of the dog, for one
true inference invariably suggests others. The
Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was
kept in the stables, and yet, though some one
had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had
not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the
loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one
whom the dog knew well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was already convinced, or almost convinced,
that John Straker went down to the stables in the
dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For
what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or
why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet
I was at a loss to know why. There have been
cases before now where trainers have made sure
of great sums of money by laying against their
own horses, through agents, and then preventing
them from winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a
pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and
subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that
the contents of his pockets might help me to form
a conclusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they did so. You cannot have forgotten
the singular knife which was found in the dead
man&#8217;s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man
would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Wat-
son told us, a form of knife which is used for the
most delicate operations known in surgery. And it
was to be used for a delicate operation that night.
You must know, with your wide experience of turf
matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make
</p>
<p>a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse&#8217;s ham,
and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave abso-
lutely no trace. A horse so treated would develop
a slight lameness, which would be put down to
a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but
never to foul play.&#8221;
