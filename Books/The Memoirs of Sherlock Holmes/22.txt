<p>he July which immediately succeeded
my marriage was made memorable by
three cases of interest, in which I had the
privilege of being associated with Sher-
</p>
<p>lock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find
them recorded in my notes under the headings of
&#8220;The Adventure of the Second Stain,&#8221; &#8220;The Ad-
venture of the Naval Treaty,&#8221; and &#8220;The Adventure
of the Tired Captain.&#8221; The first of these, however,
deals with interest of such importance and impli-
cates so many of the first families in the kingdom
that for many years it will be impossible to make
it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was
engaged has ever illustrated the value of his ana-
lytical methods so clearly or has impressed those
who were associated with him so deeply. I still
retain an almost verbatim report of the interview
in which he demonstrated the true facts of the
case to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and
Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of
Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies
upon what proved to be side-issues. The new cen-
tury will have come, however, before the story can
be safely told. Meanwhile I pass on to the second
on my list, which promised also at one time to be
of national importance, and was marked by several
incidents which give it a quite unique character.
</p>
<p>During my school-days I had been intimately
associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who
was of much the same age as myself, though he
was two classes ahead of me. He was a very
brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which
the school had to offer, finished his exploits by
winning a scholarship which sent him on to con-
tinue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was,
I remember, extremely well connected, and even
when we were all little boys together we knew
that his mother&#8217;s brother was Lord Holdhurst, the
great conservative politician. This gaudy relation-
ship did him little good at school. On the contrary,
it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him
about the playground and hit him over the shins
with a wicket. But it was another thing when he
came out into the world. I heard vaguely that his
abilities and the influences which he commanded
had won him a good position at the Foreign Office,
and then he passed completely out of my mind un-
til the following letter recalled his existence:
</p>
<p>Briarbrae, Woking.
My dear Watson:
</p>
<p>I have no doubt that you can remem-
ber &#8220;Tadpole&#8221; Phelps, who was in the
fifth form when you were in the third.
It is possible even that you may have
</p>
<p>heard that through my uncle&#8217;s influ-
ence I obtained a good appointment at
the Foreign Office, and that I was in a
situation of trust and honor until a hor-
rible misfortune came suddenly to blast
my career.
</p>
<p>There is no use writing of the details
of that dreadful event. In the event
of your acceding to my request it is
probable that I shall have to narrate
them to you. I have only just recovered
from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am
still exceedingly weak. Do you think
that you could bring your friend Mr.
Holmes down to see me? I should like
to have his opinion of the case, though
the authorities assure me that nothing
more can be done. Do try to bring him
down, and as soon as possible. Every
minute seems an hour while I live in
this state of horrible suspense. Assure
him that if I have not asked his advice
sooner it was not because I did not ap-
preciate his talents, but because I have
been off my head ever since the blow
fell. Now I am clear again, though I
dare not think of it too much for fear of
a relapse. I am still so weak that I have
to write, as you see, by dictating. Do
try to bring him.
</p>
<p>Your old school-fellow,
Percy Phelps.
</p>
<p>There was something that touched me as I read
this letter, something pitiable in the reiterated ap-
peals to bring Holmes. So moved was I that even
had it been a difficult matter I should have tried
it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his
art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid
as his client could be to receive it. My wife agreed
with me that not a moment should be lost in lay-
ing the matter before him, and so within an hour
of breakfast-time I found myself back once more
in the old rooms in Baker Street.
</p>
<p>Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his
dressing-gown, and working hard over a chemical
investigation. A large curved retort was boiling fu-
riously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen burner, and
the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre
measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I en-
tered, and I, seeing that his investigation must be
of importance, seated myself in an arm-chair and
waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, draw-
ing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette,
</p>
<p>389</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>and finally brought a test-tube containing a solu-
tion over to the table. In his right hand he held a
slip of litmus-paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You come at a crisis, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If this
paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it
means a man&#8217;s life.&#8221; He dipped it into the test-
tube and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crim-
son. &#8220;Hum! I thought as much!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I will
be at your service in an instant, Watson. You will
find tobacco in the Persian slipper.&#8221; He turned to
his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which
were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw
himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up
his knees until his fingers clasped round his long,
thin shins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very commonplace little murder,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got something better, I fancy. You are the
stormy petrel of crime, Watson. What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I handed him the letter, which he read with the
most concentrated attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not tell us very much, does it?&#8221; he re-
marked, as he handed it back to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet the writing is of interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the writing is not his own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. It is a woman&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s surely,&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a woman&#8217;s, and a woman of rare charac-
ter. You see, at the commencement of an investiga-
tion it is something to know that your client is in
close contact with some one who, for good or evil,
has an exceptional nature. My interest is already
awakened in the case. If you are ready we will
start at once for Woking, and see this diplomatist
who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he
dictates his letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to catch an early
train at Waterloo, and in a little under an hour
we found ourselves among the fir-woods and the
heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large
detached house standing in extensive grounds
within a few minutes&#8217; walk of the station. On
sending in our cards we were shown into an el-
egantly appointed drawing-room, where we were
joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man
who received us with much hospitality. His age
may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his
cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that
he still conveyed the impression of a plump and
mischievous boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad that you have come,&#8221; said he,
shaking our hands with effusion. &#8220;Percy has been
</p>
<p>inquiring for you all morning. Ah, poor old chap,
he clings to any straw! His father and his mother
asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the
subject is very painful to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had no details yet,&#8221; observed
Holmes. &#8220;I perceive that you are not yourself a
member of the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then,
glancing down, he began to laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you saw the J H monogram on my
locket,&#8221; said he. &#8220;For a moment I thought you
had done something clever. Joseph Harrison is
my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister An-
nie I shall at least be a relation by marriage. You
will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed
him hand-and-foot this two months back. Perhaps
we&#8217;d better go in at once, for I know how impatient
he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chamber in which we were shown was on
the same floor as the drawing-room. It was fur-
nished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom,
with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and
corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was
lying upon a sofa near the open window, through
which came the rich scent of the garden and the
balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside
him, who rose as we entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I leave, Percy?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>He clutched her hand to detain her. &#8220;How are
you, Watson?&#8221; said he, cordially. &#8220;I should never
have known you under that moustache, and I dare
say you would not be prepared to swear to me.
This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sher-
lock Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I introduced him in a few words, and we both
sat down. The stout young man had left us, but his
sister still remained with her hand in that of the
invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a little
short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful
olive complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a
wealth of deep black hair. Her rich tints made the
white face of her companion the more worn and
haggard by the contrast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t waste your time,&#8221; said he, raising him-
self upon the sofa. &#8220;I&#8217;ll plunge into the matter
without further preamble. I was a happy and suc-
cessful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of being
married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune
wrecked all my prospects in life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, as Watson may have told you, in the
Foreign Office, and through the influences of my
</p>
<p>390</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose rapidly to a responsi-
ble position. When my uncle became foreign min-
ister in this administration he gave me several mis-
sions of trust, and as I always brought them to a
successful conclusion, he came at last to have the
utmost confidence in my ability and tact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly ten weeks ago&#8212;to be more accurate,
on the twenty-third of May&#8212;he called me into his
private room, and, after complimenting me on the
good work which I had done, he informed me that
he had a new commission of trust for me to exe-
cute.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This,&#8217; said he, taking a gray roll of paper
from his bureau, &#8216;is the original of that secret treaty
between England and Italy of which, I regret to
say, some rumors have already got into the public
press. It is of enormous importance that nothing
further should leak out. The French or the Russian
embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the
contents of these papers. They should not leave
my bureau were it not that it is absolutely neces-
sary to have them copied. You have a desk in your
office?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then take the treaty and lock it up there. I
shall give directions that you may remain behind
when the others go, so that you may copy it at your
leisure without fear of being overlooked. When
you have finished, relock both the original and the
draft in the desk, and hand them over to me per-
sonally to-morrow morning.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the papers and&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me an instant,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Were
you alone during this conversation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a large room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty feet each way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the centre?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And speaking low?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle&#8217;s voice is always remarkably low. I
hardly spoke at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes, shutting his eyes;
&#8220;pray go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did exactly what he indicated, and waited
until the other clerks had departed. One of them in
my room, Charles Gorot, had some arrears of work
to make up, so I left him there and went out to
dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious
to hurry my work, for I knew that Joseph&#8212;the Mr.
Harrison whom you saw just now&#8212;was in town,
</p>
<p>and that he would travel down to Woking by the
eleven-o&#8217;clock train, and I wanted if possible to
catch it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came to examine the treaty I saw at
once that it was of such importance that my un-
cle had been guilty of no exaggeration in what he
had said. Without going into details, I may say
that it defined the position of Great Britain towards
the Triple Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy
which this country would pursue in the event of
the French fleet gaining a complete ascendancy
over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The ques-
tions treated in it were purely naval. At the end
were the signatures of the high dignitaries who
had signed it. I glanced my eyes over it, and then
settled down to my task of copying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a long document, written in the French
language, and containing twenty-six separate ar-
ticles. I copied as quickly as I could, but at nine
o&#8217;clock I had only done nine articles, and it seemed
hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was
feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner
and also from the effects of a long day&#8217;s work. A
cup of coffee would clear my brain. A commission-
aire remains all night in a little lodge at the foot of
the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at
his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be
working over time. I rang the bell, therefore, to
summon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To my surprise, it was a woman who an-
swered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly
woman, in an apron. She explained that she was
the commissionaire&#8217;s wife, who did the charing,
and I gave her the order for the coffee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote two more articles and then, feeling
more drowsy than ever, I rose and walked up and
down the room to stretch my legs. My coffee had
not yet come, and I wondered what was the cause
of the delay could be. Opening the door, I started
down the corridor to find out. There was a straight
passage, dimly lighted, which led from the room
in which I had been working, and was the only
exit from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with
the commissionaire&#8217;s lodge in the passage at the
bottom. Half way down this staircase is a small
landing, with another passage running into it at
right angles. This second one leads by means of a
second small stair to a side door, used by servants,
and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from
Charles Street. Here is a rough chart of the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I think that I quite follow you,&#8221;
said Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>391</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of the utmost importance that you should
notice this point. I went down the stairs and into
the hall, where I found the commissionaire fast
asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling furiously
upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and blew
out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the
floor. Then I put out my hand and was about
to shake the man, who was still sleeping soundly,
when a bell over his head rang loudly, and he woke
with a start.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Mr. Phelps, sir!&#8217; said he, looking at me in
bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I came down to see if my coffee was ready.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir.&#8217;
He looked at me and then up at the still quivering
bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?&#8217;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The bell!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;What bell is it?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s the bell of the room you were working
in.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cold hand seemed to close round my heart.
Some one, then, was in that room where my pre-
cious treaty lay upon the table. I ran frantically up
the stair and along the passage. There was no one
in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in
the room. All was exactly as I left it, save only that
the papers which had been committed to my care
had been taken from the desk on which they lay.
The copy was there, and the original was gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his
hands. I could see that the problem was entirely
to his heart. &#8220;Pray, what did you do then?&#8221; he
murmured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognized in an instant that the thief must
have come up the stairs from the side door. Of
course I must have met him if he had come the
other way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were satisfied that he could not have
been concealed in the room all the time, or in the
</p>
<p>corridor which you have just described as dimly
lighted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely impossible. A rat could not
conceal himself either in the room or the corridor.
There is no cover at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Pray proceed.&#8221;
&#8220;The commissionaire, seeing by my pale face
</p>
<p>that something was to be feared, had followed me
upstairs. Now we both rushed along the corridor
and down the steep steps which led to Charles
Street. The door at the bottom was closed, but
unlocked. We flung it open and rushed out. I
can distinctly remember that as we did so there
came three chimes from a neighboring clock. It
was quarter to ten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is of enormous importance,&#8221; said
Holmes, making a note upon his shirt-cuff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The night was very dark, and a thin, warm
rain was falling. There was no one in Charles
Street, but a great traffic was going on, as usual,
in Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along
the pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the
far corner we found a policeman standing.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;A robbery has been committed,&#8217; I gasped. &#8216;A
document of immense value has been stolen from
the Foreign Office. Has any one passed this way?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have been standing here for a quarter of an
hour, sir,&#8217; said he; &#8216;only one person has passed dur-
ing that time&#8212;a woman, tall and elderly, with a
Paisley shawl.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, that is only my wife,&#8217; cried the commis-
sionaire; &#8216;has no one else passed?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No one.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Then it must be the other way that the thief
</p>
<p>took,&#8217; cried the fellow, tugging at my sleeve.
&#8220;But I was not satisfied, and the attempts
</p>
<p>which he made to draw me away increased my
suspicions.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Which way did the woman go?&#8217; I cried.
&#8220; &#8216;I don&#8217;t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had
</p>
<p>no special reason for watching her. She seemed to
be in a hurry.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How long ago was it?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Oh, not very many minutes.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Within the last five?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Well, it could not be more than five.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;You&#8217;re only wasting your time, sir, and every
</p>
<p>minute now is of importance,&#8217; cried the commis-
sionaire; &#8216;take my word for it that my old woman
has nothing to do with it, and come down to the
other end of the street. Well, if you won&#8217;t, I will.&#8217;
And with that he rushed off in the other direction.
</p>
<p>392</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;But I was after him in an instant and caught
him by the sleeve.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Where do you live?&#8217; said I.
&#8220; &#8216;16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;But
</p>
<p>don&#8217;t let yourself be drawn away upon a false
scent, Mr. Phelps. Come to the other end of the
street and let us see if we can hear of anything.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing was to be lost by following his ad-
vice. With the policeman we both hurried down,
but only to find the street full of traffic, many peo-
ple coming and going, but all only too eager to get
to a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was
no lounger who could tell us who had passed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we returned to the office, and searched
the stairs and the passage without result. The cor-
ridor which led to the room was laid down with a
kind of creamy linoleum which shows an impres-
sion very easily. We examined it very carefully, but
found no outline of any footmark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had it been raining all evening?&#8221;
&#8220;Since about seven.&#8221;
&#8220;How is it, then, that the woman who came
</p>
<p>into the room about nine left no traces with her
muddy boots?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you raised the point. It occurred to
me at the time. The charwomen are in the habit
of taking off their boots at the commissionaire&#8217;s
office, and putting on list slippers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very clear. There were no marks, then,
though the night was a wet one? The chain of
events is certainly one of extraordinary interest.
What did you do next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We examined the room also. There is no pos-
sibility of a secret door, and the windows are quite
thirty feet from the ground. Both of them were fas-
tened on the inside. The carpet prevents any pos-
sibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordi-
nary whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that
whoever stole my papers could only have come
through the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the fireplace?&#8221;
&#8220;They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope
</p>
<p>hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk.
Whoever rang it must have come right up to the
desk to do it. But why should any criminal wish
to ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly the incident was unusual. What
were your next steps? You examined the room,
I presume, to see if the intruder had left any
traces&#8212;any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin
or other trifle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing of the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No smell?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, we never thought of that.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth
</p>
<p>a great deal to us in such an investigation.&#8221;
&#8220;I never smoke myself, so I think I should have
</p>
<p>observed it if there had been any smell of tobacco.
There was absolutely no clue of any kind. The
only tangible fact was that the commissionaire&#8217;s
wife&#8212;Mrs. Tangey was the name&#8212;had hurried
out of the place. He could give no explanation
save that it was about the time when the woman
always went home. The policeman and I agreed
that our best plan would be to seize the woman
before she could get rid of the papers, presuming
that she had them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this
time, and Mr. Forbes, the detective, came round at
once and took up the case with a great deal of en-
ergy. We hired a hansom, and in half an hour we
were at the address which had been given to us.
A young woman opened the door, who proved to
be Mrs. Tangey&#8217;s eldest daughter. Her mother had
not come back yet, and we were shown into the
front room to wait.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About ten minutes later a knock came at the
door, and here we made the one serious mistake
for which I blame myself. Instead of opening the
door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We
heard her say, &#8216;Mother, there are two men in the
house waiting to see you,&#8217; and an instant after-
wards we heard the patter of feet rushing down
the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we
both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the
woman had got there before us. She stared at us
with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly recognizing
me, an expression of absolute astonishment came
over her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Why, if it isn&#8217;t Mr. Phelps, of the office!&#8217; she
cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Come, come, who did you think we were
when you ran away from us?&#8217; asked my compan-
ion.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I thought you were the brokers,&#8217; said she, &#8216;we
have had some trouble with a tradesman.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That&#8217;s not quite good enough,&#8217; answered
Forbes. &#8216;We have reason to believe that you have
taken a paper of importance from the Foreign Of-
fice, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You
must come back with us to Scotland Yard to be
searched.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in vain that she protested and resisted.
A four-wheeler was brought, and we all three
drove back in it. We had first made an examina-
tion of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen
</p>
<p>393</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>fire, to see whether she might have made away
with the papers during the instant that she was
alone. There were no signs, however, of any ashes
or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard she
was handed over at once to the female searcher.
I waited in an agony of suspense until she came
back with her report. There were no signs of the
papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then for the first time the horror of my situa-
tion came in its full force. Hitherto I had been act-
ing, and action had numbed thought. I had been
so confident of regaining the treaty at once that I
had not dared to think of what would be the con-
sequence if I failed to do so. But now there was
nothing more to be done, and I had leisure to re-
alize my position. It was horrible. Watson there
would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy
at school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle
and of his colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame
which I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon
every one connected with me. What though I was
the victim of an extraordinary accident? No al-
lowance is made for accidents where diplomatic
interests are at stake. I was ruined, shamefully,
hopelessly ruined. I don&#8217;t know what I did. I fancy
I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection
of a group of officials who crowded round me, en-
deavoring to soothe me. One of them drove down
with me to Waterloo, and saw me into the Wok-
ing train. I believe that he would have come all the
way had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near
me, was going down by that very train. The doctor
most kindly took charge of me, and it was well he
did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before we
reached home I was practically a raving maniac.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine the state of things here when
they were roused from their beds by the doctor&#8217;s
ringing and found me in this condition. Poor An-
nie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr.
Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at
the station to be able to give an idea of what had
happened, and his story did not mend matters. It
was evident to all that I was in for a long illness,
so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom,
and it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I
have lain, Mr. Holmes, for over nine weeks, uncon-
scious, and raving with brain-fever. If it had not
been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor&#8217;s
care I should not be speaking to you now. She has
nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked
after me by night, for in my mad fits I was capable
of anything. Slowly my reason has cleared, but it
is only during the last three days that my memory
has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never
had. The first thing that I did was to wire to Mr.
</p>
<p>Forbes, who had the case in hand. He came out,
and assures me that, though everything has been
done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The
commissionaire and his wife have been examined
in every way without any light being thrown upon
the matter. The suspicions of the police then rested
upon young Gorot, who, as you may remember,
stayed over time in the office that night. His re-
maining behind and his French name were really
the only two points which could suggest suspicion;
but, as a matter of fact, I did not begin work until
he had gone, and his people are of Huguenot ex-
traction, but as English in sympathy and tradition
as you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate
him in any way, and there the matter dropped.
I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last
hope. If you fail me, then my honor as well as my
position are forever forfeited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired
out by this long recital, while his nurse poured him
out a glass of some stimulating medicine. Holmes
sat silently, with his head thrown back and his eyes
closed, in an attitude which might seem listless to
a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most
intense self-absorption.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You statement has been so explicit,&#8221; said he at
last, &#8220;that you have really left me very few ques-
tions to ask. There is one of the very utmost im-
portance, however. Did you tell any one that you
had this special task to perform?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;
&#8220;Not Miss Harrison here, for example?&#8221;
&#8220;No. I had not been back to Woking between
</p>
<p>getting the order and executing the commission.&#8221;
&#8220;And none of your people had by chance been
</p>
<p>to see you?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Did any of them know their way about in the
</p>
<p>office?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.&#8221;
&#8220;Still, of course, if you said nothing to any one
</p>
<p>about the treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.&#8221;
&#8220;I said nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you know anything of the commission-
</p>
<p>aire?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing except that he is an old soldier.&#8221;
&#8220;What regiment?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, I have heard&#8212;Coldstream Guards.&#8221;
&#8220;Thank you. I have no doubt I can get de-
</p>
<p>tails from Forbes. The authorities are excellent
at amassing facts, though they do not always use
them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>394</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>He walked past the couch to the open window,
and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose,
looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and
green. It was a new phase of his character to me,
for I had never before seen him show any keen
interest in natural objects.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in which deduction is so nec-
essary as in religion,&#8221; said he, leaning with his
back against the shutters. &#8220;It can be built up as an
exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assur-
ance of the goodness of Providence seems to me
to rest in the flowers. All other things, our pow-
ers our desires, our food, are all really necessary
for our existence in the first instance. But this rose
is an extra. Its smell and its color are an embel-
lishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only
goodness which gives extras, and so I say again
that we have much to hope from the flowers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes
during this demonstration with surprise and a
good deal of disappointment written upon their
faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the moss-
rose between his fingers. It had lasted some min-
utes before the young lady broke in upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see any prospect of solving this mys-
tery, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; she asked, with a touch of as-
perity in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the mystery!&#8221; he answered, coming back
with a start to the realities of life. &#8220;Well, it would
be absurd to deny that the case is a very abstruse
and complicated one, but I can promise you that
I will look into the matter and let you know any
points which may strike me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see any clue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have furnished me with seven, but, of
course, I must test them before I can pronounce
upon their value.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You suspect some one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go to London and test your conclu-
sions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,&#8221;
said Holmes, rising. &#8220;I think, Watson, we cannot
do better. Do not allow yourself to indulge in false
hopes, Mr. Phelps. The affair is a very tangled
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be in a fever until I see you again,&#8221; cried
the diplomatist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll come out be the same train to-
morrow, though it&#8217;s more than likely that my re-
port will be a negative one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you for promising to come,&#8221; cried
our client. &#8220;It gives me fresh life to know that
something is being done. By the way, I have had a
letter from Lord Holdhurst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! What did he say?&#8221;
&#8220;He was cold, but not harsh. I dare say my
</p>
<p>severe illness prevented him from being that. He
repeated that the matter was of the utmost impor-
tance, and added that no steps would be taken
about my future&#8212;by which he means, of course,
my dismissal&#8212;until my health was restored and I
had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was reasonable and considerate,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Come, Watson, for we have a goody
day&#8217;s work before us in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the
station, and we were soon whirling up in a
Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in profound
thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we
had passed Clapham Junction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very cheery thing to come into London
by any of these lines which run high, and allow
you to look down upon the houses like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I thought he was joking, for the view was sor-
did enough, but he soon explained himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at those big, isolated clumps of building
rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a
lead-colored sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The board-schools.&#8221;
&#8220;Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future!
</p>
<p>Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in
each, out of which will spring the wise, better Eng-
land of the future. I suppose that man Phelps does
not drink?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not think so.&#8221;
&#8220;Nor should I, but we are bound to take every
</p>
<p>possibility into account. The poor devil has cer-
tainly got himself into very deep water, and it&#8217;s a
question whether we shall ever be able to get him
ashore. What did you think of Miss Harrison?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl of strong character.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken.
</p>
<p>She and her brother are the only children of an
iron-master somewhere up Northumberland way.
He got engaged to her when traveling last winter,
and she came down to be introduced to his people,
with her brother as escort. Then came the smash,
and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother
Joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been making a few independent inquiries, you
see. But to-day must be a day of inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My practice&#8212;&#8221; I began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you find your own cases more interest-
ing than mine&#8212;&#8221; said Holmes, with some asperity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say that my practice could get
along very well for a day or two, since it is the
slackest time in the year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said he, recovering his good-
humor. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll look into this matter together.
I think that we should begin be seeing Forbes. He
can probably tell us all the details we want un-
til we know from what side the case is to be ap-
proached.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you had a clue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have several, but we can only test
their value by further inquiry. The most difficult
crime to track is the one which is purposeless.
Now this is not purposeless. Who is it who profits
by it? There is the French ambassador, there is the
Russian, there is who-ever might sell it to either of
these, and there is Lord Holdhurst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Holdhurst!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman
might find himself in a position where he was not
sorry to have such a document accidentally de-
stroyed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a statesman with the honorable record of
Lord Holdhurst?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a possibility and we cannot afford to dis-
regard it. We shall see the noble lord to-day and
find out if he can tell us anything. Meanwhile I
have already set inquiries on foot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I sent wires from Woking station to every
evening paper in London. This advertisement will
appear in each of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed over a sheet torn from a note-book.
On it was scribbled in pencil:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#163;10 reward. The number of the cab
which dropped a fare at or about the
door of the Foreign Office in Charles
Street at quarter to ten in the evening
of May 23d. Apply 221b, Baker Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are confident that the thief came in a
cab?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps
is correct in stating that there is no hiding-place ei-
ther in the room or the corridors, then the person
must have come from outside. If he came from
</p>
<p>outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace
of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined
within a few minutes of his passing, then it is ex-
ceeding probably that he came in a cab. Yes, I think
that we may safely deduce a cab.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds plausible.&#8221;
&#8220;That is one of the clues of which I spoke. It
</p>
<p>may lead us to something. And then, of course,
there is the bell&#8212;which is the most distinctive fea-
ture of the case. Why should the bell ring? Was it
the thief who did it out of bravado? Or was it some
one who was with the thief who did it in order to
prevent the crime? Or was it an accident? Or was
it&#8212;?&#8221; He sank back into the state of intense and
silent thought from which he had emerged; but
it seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his ev-
ery mood, that some new possibility had dawned
suddenly upon him.
</p>
<p>It was twenty past three when we reached our
terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet
we pushed on at once to Scotland Yard. Holmes
had already wired to Forbes, and we found him
waiting to receive us&#8212;a small, foxy man with a
sharp but by no means amiable expression. He
was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, espe-
cially when he heard the errand upon which we
had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of your methods before now, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he, tartly. &#8220;You are ready enough
to use all the information that the police can lay at
your disposal, and then you try to finish the case
yourself and bring discredit on them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;out of my
last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared
in four, and the police have had all the credit in
forty-nine. I don&#8217;t blame you for not knowing this,
for you are young and inexperienced, but if you
wish to get on in your new duties you will work
with me and not against me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad of a hint or two,&#8221; said the de-
tective, changing his manner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve certainly had
no credit from the case so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What steps have you taken?&#8221;
&#8220;Tangey, the commissionaire, has been shad-
</p>
<p>owed. He left the Guards with a good character
and we can find nothing against him. His wife is
a bad lot, though. I fancy she knows more about
this than appears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you shadowed her?&#8221;
&#8220;We have set one of our women on to her. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Tangey drinks, and our woman has been with her
twice when she was well on, but she could get
nothing out of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>396</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I understand that they have had brokers in the
house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they were paid off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did the money come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all right. His pension was due. They
have not shown any sign of being in funds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What explanation did she give of having an-
swered the bell when Mr. Phelps rang for the cof-
fee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She said that he husband was very tired and
she wished to relieve him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, certainly that would agree with his be-
ing found a little later asleep in his chair. There is
nothing against them then but the woman&#8217;s char-
acter. Did you ask her why she hurried away that
night? Her haste attracted the attention of the po-
lice constable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was later than usual and wanted to get
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you point out to her that you and Mr.
Phelps, who started at least twenty minutes after
he, got home before her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She explains that by the difference between a
&#8217;bus and a hansom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she make it clear why, on reaching her
house, she ran into the back kitchen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she had the money there with which
to pay off the brokers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has at least an answer for everything. Did
you ask her whether in leaving she met any one or
saw any one loitering about Charles Street?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She saw no one but the constable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you seem to have cross-examined her
pretty thoroughly. What else have you done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clerk Gorot has been shadowed all these
nine weeks, but without result. We can show noth-
ing against him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have nothing else to go upon&#8212;no ev-
idence of any kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you formed a theory about how that bell
rang?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess that it beats me. It was
a cool hand, whoever it was, to go and give the
alarm like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was a queer thing to do. Many thanks
to you for what you have told me. If I can put
the man into your hands you shall hear from me.
Come along, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going to now?&#8221; I asked, as we
left the office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now going to interview Lord Hold-
hurst, the cabinet minister and future premier of
England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were fortunate in finding that Lord Hold-
hurst was still in his chambers in Downing Street,
and on Holmes sending in his card we were in-
stantly shown up. The statesman received us
with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is
remarkable, and seated us on the two luxuriant
lounges on either side of the fireplace. Standing on
the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his
sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair
prematurely tinged with gray, he seemed to repre-
sent that not to common type, a nobleman who is
in truth noble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name is very familiar to me, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he, smiling. &#8220;And, of course, I can-
not pretend to be ignorant of the object of your
visit. There has only been one occurrence in these
offices which could call for your attention. In
whose interest are you acting, may I ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,&#8221; answered
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my unfortunate nephew! You can under-
stand that our kinship makes it the more impossi-
ble for me to screen him in any way. I fear that the
incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon
his career.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the document is found?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, that, of course, would be different.&#8221;
&#8220;I had one or two questions which I wished to
</p>
<p>ask you, Lord Holdhurst.&#8221;
&#8220;I shall be happy to give you any information
</p>
<p>in my power.&#8221;
&#8220;Was it in this room that you gave your instruc-
</p>
<p>tions as to the copying of the document?&#8221;
&#8220;It was.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you could hardly have been overheard?&#8221;
&#8220;It is out of the question.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you ever mention to any one that it was
</p>
<p>your intention to give any one the treaty to be
copied?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;
&#8220;You are certain of that?&#8221;
&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps
</p>
<p>never said so, and nobody else knew anything of
the matter, then the thief&#8217;s presence in the room
was purely accidental. He saw his chance and he
took it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>397</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>The statesman smiled. &#8220;You take me out of my
province there,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Holmes considered for a moment. &#8220;There is an-
other very important point which I wish to discuss
with you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You feared, as I understand,
that very grave results might follow from the de-
tails of this treaty becoming known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the expressive face of
the statesman. &#8220;Very grave results indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And have they occurred?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French
or Russian Foreign Office, you would expect to
hear of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should,&#8221; said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then,
and nothing has been heard, it is not unfair to
suppose that for some reason the treaty has not
reached them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the
thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang
it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he waits a little longer he will get no price
at all. The treaty will cease to be secret in a few
months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is most important,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Of
course, it is a possible supposition that the thief
has had a sudden illness&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An attack of brain-fever, for example?&#8221; asked
the statesman, flashing a swift glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say so,&#8221; said Holmes, imperturbably.
&#8220;And now, Lord Holdhurst, we have already taken
up too much of your valuable time, and we shall
wish you good-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every success to your investigation, be the
criminal who it may,&#8221; answered the nobleman, as
he bowed us out the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine fellow,&#8221; said Holmes, as we came
out into Whitehall. &#8220;But he has a struggle to keep
up his position. He is far from rich and has many
calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots had
been resoled. Now, Watson, I won&#8217;t detain you
from your legitimate work any longer. I shall do
nothing more to-day, unless I have an answer to
my cab advertisement. But I should be extremely
obliged to you if you would come down with me
to Woking to-morrow, by the same train which we
took yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I met him accordingly next morning and we
traveled down to Woking together. He had had
no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no
fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He
had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of
countenance of a red Indian, and I could not gather
from his appearance whether he was satisfied or
not with the position of the case. His conversa-
tion, I remember, was about the Bertillon system
of measurements, and he expressed his enthusias-
tic admiration of the French savant.
</p>
<p>We found our client still under the charge of
his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better
than before. He rose from the sofa and greeted us
without difficulty when we entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.
&#8220;My report, as I expected, is a negative one,&#8221;
</p>
<p>said Holmes. &#8220;I have seen Forbes, and I have seen
your uncle, and I have set one or two trains of in-
quiry upon foot which may lead to something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not lost heart, then?&#8221;
&#8220;By no means.&#8221;
&#8220;God bless you for saying that!&#8221; cried Miss
</p>
<p>Harrison. &#8220;If we keep our courage and our pa-
tience the truth must come out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have more to tell you than you have for
us,&#8221; said Phelps, reseating himself upon the couch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped you might have something.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, we have had an adventure during the
</p>
<p>night, and one which might have proved to be a
serious one.&#8221; His expression grew very grave as
he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear
sprang up in his eyes. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that I begin to believe that I am the unconscious
centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my
life is aimed at as well as my honor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Holmes.
&#8220;It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I
</p>
<p>know, an enemy in the world. Yet from last night&#8217;s
experience I can come to no other conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray let me hear it.&#8221;
&#8220;You must know that last night was the very
</p>
<p>first night that I have ever slept without a nurse in
the room. I was so much better that I thought I
could dispense with one. I had a night-light burn-
ing, however. Well, about two in the morning I
had sunk into a light sleep when I was suddenly
aroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound
which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank,
and I lay listening to it for some time under the im-
pression that it must come from that cause. Then
it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the
</p>
<p>398</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>window a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in amaze-
ment. There could be no doubt what the sounds
were now. The first ones had been caused by
some one forcing an instrument through the slit
between the sashes, and the second by the catch
being pressed back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a pause then for about ten minutes,
as if the person were waiting to see whether the
noise had awakened me. Then I heard a gentle
creaking as the window was very slowly opened.
I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not
what they used to be. I sprang out of bed and
flung open the shutters. A man was crouching at
the window. I could see little of him, for he was
gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort
of cloak which came across the lower part of his
face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that
he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me
like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as
he turned to run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is most interesting,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Pray
what did you do then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have followed him through the open
window if I had been stronger. As it was, I rang
the bell and roused the house. It took me some
little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and the
servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and
that brought Joseph down, and he roused the oth-
ers. Joseph and the groom found marks on the
bed outside the window, but the weather has been
so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow
the trail across the grass. There&#8217;s a place, however,
on the wooden fence which skirts the road which
shows signs, they tell me, as if some one had got
over, and had snapped the top of the rail in doing
so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I
thought I had best have your opinion first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This tale of our client&#8217;s appeared to have an ex-
traordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose
from his chair and paced about the room in uncon-
trollable excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Misfortunes never come single,&#8221; said Phelps,
smiling, though it was evident that his adventure
had somewhat shaken him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have certainly had your share,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Do you think you could walk round the
house with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph
will come, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I also,&#8221; said Miss Harrison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid not,&#8221; said Holmes, shaking his
head. &#8220;I think I must ask you to remain sitting
exactly where you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young lady resumed her seat with an air of
displeasure. Her brother, however, had joined us
and we set off all four together. We passed round
the lawn to the outside of the young diploma-
tist&#8217;s window. There were, as he had said, marks
upon the bed, but they were hopelessly blurred
and vague. Holmes stopped over them for an in-
stant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any one could make much of
this,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Let us go round the house and see
why this particular room was chose by the burglar.
I should have thought those larger windows of the
drawing-room and dining-room would have had
more attractions for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are more visible from the road,&#8221; sug-
gested Mr. Joseph Harrison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which
he might have attempted. What is it for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the side entrance for trades-people. Of
course it is locked at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever had an alarm like this before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said our client.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you keep plate in the house, or anything
to attract burglars?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of value.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes strolled round the house with his
hands in his pockets and a negligent air which was
unusual with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said he to Joseph Harrison, &#8220;you
found some place, I understand, where the fellow
scaled the fence. Let us have a look at that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plump young man led us to a spot where
the top of one of the wooden rails had been
cracked. A small fragment of the wood was hang-
ing down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it
critically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that was done last night? It
looks rather old, does it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, possibly so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no marks of any one jumping down
upon the other side. No, I fancy we shall get no
help here. Let us go back to the bedroom and talk
the matter over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning
upon the arm of his future brother-in-law. Holmes
walked swiftly across the lawn, and we were at
the open window of the bedroom long before the
others came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Harrison,&#8221; said Holmes, speaking with
the utmost intensity of manner, &#8220;you must stay
where you are all day. Let nothing prevent you
</p>
<p>399</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>from staying where you are all day. It is of the
utmost importance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the
girl in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you go to bed lock the door of this room
on the outside and keep the key. Promise to do
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Percy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will come to London with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And am I to remain here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for his sake. You can serve him. Quick!
Promise!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other
two came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you sit moping there, Annie?&#8221; cried
her brother. &#8220;Come out into the sunshine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight
headache and this room is deliciously cool and
soothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
asked our client.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in investigating this minor affair we
must not lose sight of our main inquiry. It would
be a very great help to me if you would come up
to London with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in
an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of
any help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-
night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to propose it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit
me, he will find the bird flown. We are all in your
hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must tell us exactly
what you would like done. Perhaps you would
prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man,
you know, and he&#8217;ll look after you. We&#8217;ll have our
lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall
all three set off for town together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss
Harrison excused herself from leaving the bed-
room, in accordance with Holmes&#8217;s suggestion.
What the object of my friend&#8217;s manoeuvres was I
could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady
</p>
<p>away from Phelps, who, rejoiced by his return-
ing health and by the prospect of action, lunched
with us in the dining-room. Holmes had still more
startling surprise for us, however, for, after accom-
panying us down to the station and seeing us into
our carriage, he calmly announced that he had no
intention of leaving Woking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are one or two small points which I
should desire to clear up before I go,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some ways
rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London
you would oblige me by driving at once to Baker
Street with our friend here, and remaining with
him until I see you again. It is fortunate that you
are old school-fellows, as you must have much to
talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom
to-night, and I will be with you in time for break-
fast, for there is a train which will take me into
Waterloo at eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about our investigation in London?&#8221;
asked Phelps, ruefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at
present I can be of more immediate use here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope
to be back to-morrow night,&#8221; cried Phelps, as we
began to move from the platform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,&#8221; an-
swered Holmes, and waved his hand to us cheerily
as we shot out from the station.
</p>
<p>Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but
neither of us could devise a satisfactory reason for
this new development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he wants to find out some clue as
to the burglary last night, if a burglar it was. For
myself, I don&#8217;t believe it was an ordinary thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your own idea, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Upon my word, you may put it down to my
</p>
<p>weak nerves or not, but I believe there is some
deep political intrigue going on around me, and
that for some reason that passes my understanding
my life is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds
high-flown and absurd, but consider the fats! Why
should a thief try to break in at a bedroom win-
dow, where there could be no hope of any plunder,
and why should he come with a long knife in his
hand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure it was not a house-breaker&#8217;s
jimmy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it was a knife. I saw the flash of the
blade quite distinctly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why on earth should you be pursued with
such animosity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>400</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that
would account for his action, would it not? Pre-
suming that your theory is correct, if he can lay
his hands upon the man who threatened you last
night he will have gone a long way towards finding
who took the naval treaty. It is absurd to suppose
that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you,
while the other threatens your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Holmes said that he was not going to Bri-
arbrae.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known him for some time,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;but I never knew him do anything yet without a
very good reason,&#8221; and with that our conversation
drifted off on to other topics.
</p>
<p>But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was
still weak after his long illness, and his misfortune
made him querulous and nervous. In vain I en-
deavored to interest him in Afghanistan, in India,
in social questions, in anything which might take
his mind out of the groove. He would always come
back to his lost treaty, wondering, guessing, spec-
ulating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps
Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should
have in the morning. As the evening wore on his
excitement became quite painful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have implicit faith in Holmes?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I have seen him do some remarkable things.&#8221;
&#8220;But he never brought light into anything quite
</p>
<p>so dark as this?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, yes, I have known him solve questions
</p>
<p>which presented fewer clues than yours.&#8221;
&#8220;But not where such large interests are at
</p>
<p>stake?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that. To my certain knowledge
</p>
<p>he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning
houses of Europe in very vital matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know him well, Watson. He is such
an inscrutable fellow that I never quite know what
to make of him. Do you think he is hopeful? Do
you think he expects to make a success of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has said nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;That is a bad sign.&#8221;
&#8220;On the contrary, I have noticed that when he
</p>
<p>is off the trail he generally says so. It is when he is
on a scent and is not quite absolutely sure yet that
it is the right one that he is most taciturn. Now,
my dear fellow, we can&#8217;t help matters by making
ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore
you to go to bed and so be fresh for whatever may
await us to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was able at last to persuade my companion
to take my advice, though I knew from his excited
</p>
<p>manner that there was not much hope of sleep for
him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay
tossing half the night myself, brooding over this
strange problem, and inventing a hundred theo-
ries, each of which was more impossible than the
last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why
had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-
room all day? Why had he been so careful not to
inform the people at Briarbrae that he intended to
remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until I
fell asleep in the endeavor to find some explana-
tion which would cover all these facts.
</p>
<p>It was seven o&#8217;clock when I awoke, and I set
off at once for Phelps&#8217;s room, to find him haggard
and spent after a sleepless night. His first question
was whether Holmes had arrived yet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be here when he promised,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and
not an instant sooner or later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And my words were true, for shortly after eight
a hansom dashed up to the door and our friend
got out of it. Standing in the window we saw that
his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that
his face was very grim and pale. He entered the
house, but it was some little time before he came
upstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks like a beaten man,&#8221; cried Phelps.
I was forced to confess that he was right. &#8220;Af-
</p>
<p>ter all,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the clue of the matter lies probably
here in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phelps gave a groan.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I had
</p>
<p>hoped for so much from his return. But surely his
hand was not tied up like that yesterday. What can
be the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not wounded, Holmes?&#8221; I asked, as
my friend entered the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, it is only a scratch through my own clum-
siness,&#8221; he answered, nodding his good-mornings
to us. &#8220;This case of yours, Mr. Phelps, is certainly
one of the darkest which I have ever investigated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared that you would find it beyond you.&#8221;
&#8220;It has been a most remarkable experience.&#8221;
&#8220;That bandage tells of adventures,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us what has happened?&#8221;
&#8220;After breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember
</p>
<p>that I have breathed thirty miles of Surrey air this
morning. I suppose that there has been no answer
from my cabman advertisement? Well, well, we
cannot expect to score every time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The table was all laid, and just as I was about to
ring Mrs. Hudson entered with the tea and coffee.
A few minutes later she brought in three covers,
and we all drew up to the table, Holmes ravenous,
</p>
<p>401</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Naval Treaty
</p>
<p>I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of de-
pression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,&#8221; said
Holmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken.
&#8220;Her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good
an idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What
have you here, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ham and eggs,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! What are you going to take, Mr.
Phelps&#8212;curried fowl or eggs, or will you help
yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I can eat nothing,&#8221; said Phelps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come! Try the dish before you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I would really rather not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Holmes, with a mischievous
twinkle, &#8220;I suppose that you have no objection to
helping me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he ut-
tered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as
white as the plate upon which he looked. Across
the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-
gray paper. He caught it up, devoured it with
his eyes, and then danced madly about the room,
passing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his de-
light. Then he fell back into an arm-chair so limp
and exhausted with his own emotions that we had
to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from
fainting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There! there!&#8221; said Holmes, soothing, patting
him upon the shoulder. &#8220;It was too bad to spring
it on you like this, but Watson here will tell you
that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. &#8220;God
bless you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You have saved my honor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my own was at stake, you know,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;I assure you it is just as hateful to me to
fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a
commission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phelps thrust away the precious document into
the innermost pocket of his coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast
any further, and yet I am dying to know how you
got it and where it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee,
and turned his attention to the ham and eggs.
Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down
into his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I did first, and how I came
to do it afterwards,&#8221; said he. &#8220;After leaving you
at the station I went for a charming walk through
some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little
</p>
<p>village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn,
and took the precaution of filling my flask and of
putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There
I remained until evening, when I set off for Woking
again, and found myself in the high-road outside
Briarbrae just after sunset.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I waited until the road was clear&#8212;it
is never a very frequented one at any time, I
fancy&#8212;and then I clambered over the fence into
the grounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely the gate was open!&#8221; ejaculated Phelps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these mat-
ters. I chose the place where the three fir-trees
stand, and behind their screen I got over with-
out the least chance of any one in the house be-
ing able to see me. I crouched down among
the bushes on the other side, and crawled from
one to the other&#8212;witness the disreputable state of
my trouser knees&#8212;until I had reached the clump
of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom
window. There I squatted down and awaited de-
velopments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blind was not down in your room, and I
could see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by
the table. It was quarter-past ten when she closed
her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure
that she had turned the key in the lock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The key!&#8221; ejaculated Phelps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had given Miss Harrison instructions to
lock the door on the outside and take the key with
her when she went to bed. She carried out every
one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly
without her cooperation you would not have that
paper in you coat-pocket. She departed then and
the lights went out, and I was left squatting in the
rhododendron-bush.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The night was fine, but still it was a very
weary vigil. Of course it has the sort of excite-
ment about it that the sportsman feels when he
lies beside the water-course and waits for the big
game. It was very long, though&#8212;almost as long,
Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly
room when we looked into the little problem of the
Speckled Band. There was a church-clock down at
Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought
more than once that it had stopped. At last how-
ever about two in the morning, I suddenly heard
the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and
the creaking of a key. A moment later the ser-
vant&#8217;s door was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison
stepped out into the moonlight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph!&#8221; ejaculated Phelps.

thrown over his shoulder so that he could conceal
his face in an instant if there were any alarm. He
walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,
and when he reached the window he worked a
long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed
back the catch. Then he flung open the window,
