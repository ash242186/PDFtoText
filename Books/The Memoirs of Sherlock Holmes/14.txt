<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>[In publishing these short sketches based upon
the numerous cases in which my companion&#8217;s sin-
gular gifts have made us the listeners to, and even-
tually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only
natural that I should dwell rather upon his suc-
cesses than upon his failures. And this not so
much for the sake of his reputations&#8212;for, indeed,
it was when he was at his wits&#8217; end that his energy
and his versatility were most admirable&#8212;but be-
cause where he failed it happened too often that no
one else succeeded, and that the tale was left for-
ever without a conclusion. Now and again, how-
ever, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth
was still discovered. I have noted of some half-
dozen cases of the kind the Adventure of the Mus-
grave Ritual and that which I am about to recount
are the two which present the strongest features of
interest.]
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>herlock Holmes was a man who sel-
dom took exercise for exercise&#8217;s sake.
Few men were capable of greater muscu-
lar effort, and he was undoubtedly one
</p>
<p>of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever
seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion
as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred him-
self save when there was some professional object
to be served. Then he was absolutely untiring and
indefatigable. That he should have kept himself in
training under such circumstances is remarkable,
but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his
habits were simple to the verge of austerity. Save
for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices,
and he only turned to the drug as a protest against
the monotony of existence when cases were scanty
and the papers uninteresting.
</p>
<p>One day in early spring he had so far relaxed
as to go for a walk with me in the Park, where
the first faint shoots of green were breaking out
upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the
chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their
five-fold leaves. For two hours we rambled about
together, in silence for the most part, as befits
two men who know each other intimately. It was
nearly five before we were back in Baker Street
once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, sir,&#8221; said our page-boy, as he
opened the door. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a gentleman here
asking for you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. &#8220;So much
for afternoon walks!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Has this gentleman
gone, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ask him in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; he came in.&#8221;
&#8220;How long did he wait?&#8221;
&#8220;Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, sir, a-walkin&#8217; and a-stampin&#8217; all the time
he was here. I was waitin&#8217; outside the door, sir, and
I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage,
and he cries, &#8216;Is that man never goin&#8217; to come?&#8217;
Those were his very words, sir. &#8216;You&#8217;ll only need
to wait a little longer,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Then I&#8217;ll wait in the
open air, for I feel half choked,&#8217; says he. &#8216;I&#8217;ll be
back before long.&#8217; And with that he ups and he
outs, and all I could say wouldn&#8217;t hold him back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, you did your best,&#8221; said Holmes,
as we walked into our room. &#8220;It&#8217;s very annoying,
though, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and
this looks, from the man&#8217;s impatience, as if it were
of importance. Hullo! That&#8217;s not your pipe on the
table. He must have left his behind him. A nice
old brier with a good long stem of what the tobac-
conists call amber. I wonder how many real amber
mouthpieces there are in London? Some people
think that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have
been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind
him which he evidently values highly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that he values it highly?&#8221; I
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe
at seven and sixpence. Now it has, you see, been
twice mended, once in the wooden stem and once
in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you
observe, with silver bands, must have cost more
than the pipe did originally. The man must value
the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up
rather than buy a new one with the same money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; I asked, for Holmes was turn-
ing the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in
his peculiar pensive way.
</p>
<p>He held it up and tapped on it with his long,
thin fore-finger, as a professor might who was lec-
turing on a bone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary inter-
est,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Nothing has more individuality,
save perhaps watches and bootlaces. The indica-
tions here, however, are neither very marked nor
very important. The owner is obviously a muscu-
lar man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth,
careless in his habits, and with no need to practise
economy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend threw out the information in a very
offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at
me to see if I had followed his reasoning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think a man must be well-to-do if he
smokes a seven-shilling pipe,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>295</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Yellow Face
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an
ounce,&#8221; Holmes answered, knocking a little out on
his palm. &#8220;As he might get an excellent smoke
for half the price, he has no need to practise econ-
omy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other points?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe
at lamps and gas-jets. You can see that it is quite
charred all down one side. Of course a match
could not have done that. Why should a man hold
a match to the side of his pipe? But you cannot
light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred.
And it is all on the right side of the pipe. From
that I gather that he is a left-handed man. You
hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how nat-
urally you, being right-handed, hold the left side
to the flame. You might do it once the other way,
but not as a constancy. This has always been held
so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It takes
a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good
set of teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken
I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have some-
thing more interesting than his pipe to study.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An instant later our door opened, and a tall
young man entered the room. He was well but
quietly dressed in a dark-gray suit, and carried
a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have
put him at about thirty, though he was really some
years older.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said he, with some embar-
rassment; &#8220;I suppose I should have knocked. Yes,
of course I should have knocked. The fact is that I
am a little upset, and you must put it all down to
that.&#8221; He passed his hand over his forehead like a
man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than
sat down upon a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that you have not slept for a night or
two,&#8221; said Holmes, in his easy, genial way. &#8220;That
tries a man&#8217;s nerves more than work, and more
even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted your advice, sir. I don&#8217;t know what
to do and my whole life seems to have gone to
pieces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish to employ me as a consulting detec-
tive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that only. I want your opinion as a judi-
cious man&#8212;as a man of the world. I want to know
what I ought to do next. I hope to God you&#8217;ll be
able to tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it
seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful
</p>
<p>to him, and that his will all through was overriding
his inclinations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very delicate thing,&#8221; said he. &#8220;One
does not like to speak of one&#8217;s domestic affairs to
strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct
of one&#8217;s wife with two men whom I have never
seen before. It&#8217;s horrible to have to do it. But I&#8217;ve
got to the end of my tether, and I must have ad-
vice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Grant Munro&#8212;&#8221; began Holmes.
</p>
<p>Our visitor sprang from his chair. &#8220;What!&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;you know my nane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish to preserve your incognito,&#8221; said
Holmes, smiling, &#8220;I would suggest that you cease
to write your name upon the lining of your hat,
or else that you turn the crown towards the per-
son whom you are addressing. I was about to say
that my friend and I have listened to a good many
strange secrets in this room, and that we have had
the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled
souls. I trust that we may do as much for you.
Might I beg you, as time may prove to be of im-
portance, to furnish me with the facts of your case
without further delay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor again passed his hand over his fore-
head, as if he found it bitterly hard. From every
gesture and expression I could see that he was a re-
served, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in
his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to
expose them. Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture
of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to
the winds, he began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The facts are these, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
am a married man, and have been so for three
years. During that time my wife and I have loved
each other as fondly and lived as happily as any
two that ever were joined. We have not had a
difference, not one, in thought or word or deed.
And now, since last Monday, there has suddenly
sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that
there is something in her life and in her thought
of which I know as little as if she were the woman
who brushes by me in the street. We are estranged,
and I want to know why.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there is one thing that I want to impress
upon you before I go any further, Mr. Holmes.
Effie loves me. Don&#8217;t let there be any mistake
about that. She loves me with her whole heart and
soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel
it. I don&#8217;t want to argue about that. A man can
tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But
there&#8217;s this secret between us, and we can never be
the same until it is cleared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>296</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,&#8220; said
Holmes, with some impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I know about Effie&#8217;s history.
She was a widow when I met her first, though
quite young&#8212;only twenty-five. Her name then
was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when
she was young, and lived in the town of Atlanta,
where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer
with a good practice. They had one child, but the
yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both
husband and child died of it. I have seen his death
certificate. This sickened her of America, and she
came back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in
Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had
left her comfortably off, and that she had a capi-
tal of about four thousand five hundred pounds,
which had been so well invested by him that it
returned an average of seven per cent. She had
only been six months at Pinner when I met her;
we fell in love with each other, and we married a
few weeks afterwards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have
an income of seven or eight hundred, we found
ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-
pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was
very countrified, considering that it is so close to
town. We had an inn and two houses a little above
us, and a single cottage at the other side of the
field which faces us, and except those there were
no houses until you got half way to the station.
My business took me into town at certain seasons,
but in summer I had less to do, and then in our
country home my wife and I were just as happy
as could be wished. I tell you that there never was
a shadow between us until this accursed affair be-
gan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I ought to tell you before I
go further. When we married, my wife made over
all her property to me&#8212;rather against my will, for
I saw how awkward it would be if my business af-
fairs went wrong. However, she would have it so,
and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she
came to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Jack,&#8217; said she, &#8216;when you took my money
you said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you
for it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Certainly,&#8217; said I. &#8216;It&#8217;s all your own.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I want a hundred pounds.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imag-
ined it was simply a new dress or something of the
kind that she was after.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What on earth for?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Oh,&#8217; said she, in her playful way, &#8216;you said
that you were only my banker, and bankers never
ask questions, you know.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If you really mean it, of course you shall have
the money,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Oh, yes, I really mean it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And you won&#8217;t tell me what you want it for?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Some day, perhaps, but not just at present,
Jack.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I had to be content with that, thought it
was the first time that there had ever been any se-
cret between us. I gave her a check, and I never
thought any more of the matter. It may have noth-
ing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought
it only right to mention it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I told you just now that there is a cot-
tage not far from our house. There is just a field
between us, but to reach it you have to go along
the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it
is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be
very fond of strolling down there, for trees are al-
ways a neighborly kind of things. The cottage had
been standing empty this eight months, and it was
a pity, for it was a pretty two storied place, with
an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it.
I have stood many a time and thought what a neat
little homestead it would make.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll
down that way, when I met an empty van coming
up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things
lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. It
was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I
walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk
they were who had come to live so near us. And as
I looked I suddenly became aware that a face was
watching me out of one of the upper windows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what there was about that face,
Mr. Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right
down my back. I was some little way off, so that
I could not make out the features, but there was
something unnatural and inhuman about the face.
That was the impression that I had, and I moved
quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the per-
son who was watching me. But as I did so the face
suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed
to have been plucked away into the darkness of the
room. I stood for five minutes thinking the busi-
ness over, and trying to analyze my impressions.
I could not tell if the face were that of a man or
a woman. It had been too far from me for that.
But its color was what had impressed me most. It
was of a livid chalky white, and with something
</p>
<p>297</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Yellow Face
</p>
<p>set and rigid about it which was shockingly un-
natural. So disturbed was I that I determined to
see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage.
I approached and knocked at the door, which was
instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman with a
harsh, forbidding face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What may you be wantin&#8217;?&#8217; she asked, in a
Northern accent.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I am your neighbor over yonder,&#8217; said I, nod-
ding towards my house. &#8216;I see that you have only
just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any
help to you in any&#8212;&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ay, we&#8217;ll just ask ye when we want ye,&#8217; said
she, and shut the door in my face. Annoyed at
the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked
home. All evening, though I tried to think of
other things, my mind would still turn to the ap-
parition at the window and the rudeness of the
woman. I determined to say nothing about the
former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly
strung woman, and I had no wish that she would
share the unpleasant impression which had been
produced upon myself. I remarked to her, how-
ever, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now
occupied, to which she returned no reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It
has been a standing jest in the family that noth-
ing could ever wake me during the night. And
yet somehow on that particular night, whether
it may have been the slight excitement produced
by my little adventure or not I know not, but
I slept much more lightly than usual. Half in
my dreams I was dimly conscious that something
was going on in the room, and gradually became
aware that my wife had dressed herself and was
slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips
were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of
surprise or remonstrance at this untimely prepa-
ration, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell
upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and
astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expres-
sion such as I had never seen before&#8212;such as I
should have thought her incapable of assuming.
She was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing
furtively towards the bed as she fastened her man-
tle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, think-
ing that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly
from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp
creaking which could only come from the hinges
of the front door. I sat up in bed and rapped my
knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was
truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the
pillow. It was three in the morning. What on this
</p>
<p>earth could my wife be doing out on the country
road at three in the morning?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the
thing over in my mind and trying to find some
possible explanation. The more I thought, the
more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear.
I was still puzzling over it when I heard the door
gently close again, and her footsteps coming up
the stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Where in the world have you been, Effie?&#8217; I
asked as she entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping
cry when I spoke, and that cry and start troubled
me more than all the rest, for there was something
indescribably guilty about them. My wife had al-
ways been a woman of a frank, open nature, and
it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own
room, and crying out and wincing when her own
husband spoke to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You awake, Jack!&#8217; she cried, with a nervous
laugh. &#8216;Why, I thought that nothing could awake
you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Where have you been?&#8217; I asked, more sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I don&#8217;t wonder that you are surprised,&#8217; said
she, and I could see that her fingers were trembling
as she undid the fastenings of her mantle. &#8216;Why, I
never remember having done such a thing in my
life before. The fact is that I felt as though I were
choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of
fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted
if I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few
minutes, and now I am quite myself again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the time that she was telling me this story
she never once looked in my direction, and her
voice was quite unlike her usual tones. It was ev-
ident to me that she was saying what was false. I
said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the
wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a
thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. What
was it that my wife was concealing from me?
Where had she been during that strange expedi-
tion? I felt that I should have no peace until I knew,
and yet I shrank from asking her again after once
she had told me what was false. All the rest of the
night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after
theory, each more unlikely than the last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have gone to the City that day, but
I was too disturbed in my mind to be able to pay
attention to business matters. My wife seemed to
be as upset as myself, and I could see from the
little questioning glances which she kept shooting
at me that she understood that I disbelieved her
statement, and that she was at her wits&#8217; end what
</p>
<p>298</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>to do. We hardly exchanged a word during break-
fast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a
walk, that I might think the matter out in the fresh
morning air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went as far as the Crystal Palace, spent an
hour in the grounds, and was back in Norbury by
one o&#8217;clock. It happened that my way took me
past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to
look at the windows, and to see if I could catch a
glimpse of the strange face which had looked out
at me on the day before. As I stood there, imagine
my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when the door suddenly
opened and my wife walked out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was struck dumb with astonishment at the
sight of her; but my emotions were nothing to
those which showed themselves upon her face
when our eyes met. She seemed for an instant to
wish to shrink back inside the house again; and
then, seeing how useless all concealment must be,
she came forward, with a very white face and
frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, Jack,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I have just been in to see
if I can be of any assistance to our new neighbors.
Why do you look at me like that, Jack? You are not
angry with me?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;So,&#8217; said I, &#8216;this is where you went during the
night.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What do you mean?&#8217; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You came here. I am sure of it. Who are
these people, that you should visit them at such
an hour?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have not been here before.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How can you tell me what you know is
false?&#8217; I cried. &#8216;Your very voice changes as you
speak. When have I ever had a secret from you? I
shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the mat-
ter to the bottom.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No, no, Jack, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8217; she gasped,
in uncontrollable emotion. Then, as I approached
the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back
with convulsive strength.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I implore you not to do this, Jack,&#8217; she cried.
&#8216;I swear that I will tell you everything some day,
but nothing but misery can come of it if you enter
that cottage.&#8217; Then, as I tried to shake her off, she
clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Trust me, Jack!&#8217; she cried. &#8216;Trust me only this
once. You will never have cause to regret it. You
know that I would not have a secret from you if it
were not for your own sake. Our whole lives are
at stake in this. If you come home with me, all will
</p>
<p>be well. If you force your way into that cottage, all
is over between us.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was such earnestness, such despair, in
her manner that her words arrested me, and I
stood irresolute before the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I will trust you on one condition, and on one
condition only,&#8217; said I at last. &#8216;It is that this mys-
tery comes to an end from now. You are at liberty
to preserve your secret, but you must promise me
that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more
doings which are kept from my knowledge. I am
willing to forget those which are passed if you will
promise that there shall be no more in the future.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I was sure that you would trust me,&#8217; she
cried, with a great sigh of relief. &#8216;It shall be just
as you wish. Come away&#8212;oh, come away up to
the house.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away
from the cottage. As we went I glanced back, and
there was that yellow livid face watching us out
of the upper window. What link could there be
between that creature and my wife? Or how could
the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day
before be connected with her? It was a strange
puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never
know ease again until I had solved it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For two days after this I stayed at home, and
my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engage-
ment, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of
the house. On the third day, however, I had ample
evidence that her solemn promise was not enough
to hold her back from this secret influence which
drew her away from her husband and her duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had gone into town on that day, but I re-
turned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my
usual train. As I entered the house the maid ran
into the hall with a startled face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Where is your mistress?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I think that she has gone out for a walk,&#8217; she
answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind was instantly filled with suspicion.
I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in
the house. As I did so I happened to glance out of
one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with
whom I had just been speaking running across the
field in the direction of the cottage. Then of course
I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone
over there, and had asked the servant to call her
if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed
down and hurried across, determined to end the
matter once and forever. I saw my wife and the
maid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not
stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the
</p>
<p>299</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Yellow Face
</p>
<p>secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I
vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret
no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it,
but turned the handle and rushed into the passage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all still and quiet upon the ground floor.
In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and
a large black cat lay coiled up in the basket; but
there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen
before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally
deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find
two other rooms empty and deserted at the top.
There was no one at all in the whole house. The
furniture and pictures were of the most common
and vulgar description, save in the one chamber
at the window of which I had seen the strange
face. That was comfortable and elegant, and all
my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame when
I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a
fell-length photograph of my wife, which had been
taken at my request only three months ago.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I stayed long enough to make certain that the
house was absolutely empty. Then I left it, feeling
a weight at my heart such as I had never had be-
fore. My wife came out into the hall as I entered
my house; but I was too hurt and angry to speak
with her, and pushing past her, I made my way
into my study. She followed me, however, before I
could close the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,&#8217;
said she; &#8216;but if you knew all the circumstances I
am sure that you would forgive me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Tell me everything, then,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I cannot, Jack, I cannot,&#8217; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Until you tell me who it is that has been liv-
ing in that cottage, and who it is to whom you
have given that photograph, there can never be any
confidence between us,&#8217; said I, and breaking away
from her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr.
Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I
know anything more about this strange business.
It is the first shadow that has come between us,
and it has so shaken me that I do not know what
I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning
it occurred to me that you were the man to advise
me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place my-
self unreservedly in your hands. If there is any
point which I have not made clear, pray question
me about it. But, above all, tell me quickly what I
am to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes and I had listened with the utmost in-
terest to this extraordinary statement, which had
been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a
</p>
<p>man who is under the influence of extreme emo-
tions. My companion sat silent for some time, with
his chin upon his hand, lost in thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;could you swear that
this was a man&#8217;s face which you saw at the win-
dow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Each time that I saw it I was some distance
away from it, so that it is impossible for me to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You appear, however, to have been disagree-
ably impressed by it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed to be of an unnatural color, and to
have a strange rigidity about the features. When I
approached, it vanished with a jerk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since your wife asked you for a
hundred pounds?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly two months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a photograph of her first
husband?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there was a great fire at Atlanta very
shortly after his death, and all her papers were de-
stroyed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet she had a certificate of death. You say
that you saw it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever meet any one who knew her in
America?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or get letters from it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I should like to think over the
matter a little now. If the cottage is now perma-
nently deserted we may have some difficulty. If,
on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the in-
mates were warned of your coming, and left before
you entered yesterday, then they may be back now,
and we should clear it all up easily. Let me advise
you, then, to return to Norbury, and to examine
the windows of the cottage again. If you have rea-
son to believe that is inhabited, do not force your
way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. We
shall be with you within an hour of receiving it,
and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of
the business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if it is still empty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I shall come out to-morrow and
talk it over with you. Good-bye, and, above all,
do not fret until you know that you really have a
cause for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>300</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I am afraid that this is a bad business, Wat-
son,&#8221; said my companion, as he returned after ac-
companying Mr. Grant Munro to the door. &#8220;What
do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It had an ugly sound,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s blackmail in it, or I am much mis-
taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is the blackmailer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it must be the creature who lives in the
only comfortable room in the place, and has her
photograph above his fireplace. Upon my word,
Watson, there is something very attractive about
that livid face at the window, and I would not have
missed the case for worlds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a theory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised
if it does not turn out to be correct. This woman&#8217;s
first husband is in that cottage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How else can we explain her frenzied anxi-
ety that her second one should not enter it? The
facts, as I read them, are something like this: This
woman was married in America. Her husband
developed some hateful qualities; or shall we say
that he contracted some loathsome disease, and
became a leper or an imbecile? She flies from him
at last, returns to England, changes her name, and
starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She has been
married three years, and believes that her posi-
tion is quite secure, having shown her husband the
death certificate of some man whose name she has
assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is dis-
covered by her first husband; or, we may suppose,
by some unscrupulous woman who has attached
herself to the invalid. They write to the wife, and
threaten to come and expose her. She asks for a
hundred pounds, and endeavors to buy them off.
They come in spite of it, and when the husband
mentions casually to the wife that there a new-
comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that
they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband
is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavor
to persuade them to leave her in peace. Having
no success, she goes again next morning, and her
husband meets her, as he has told us, as she comes
out. She promises him then not to go there again,
but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of
those dreadful neighbors was too strong for her,
and she made another attempt, taking down with
her the photograph which had probably been de-
manded from her. In the midst of this interview
the maid rushed in to say that the master had come
home, on which the wife, knowing that he would
</p>
<p>come straight down to the cottage, hurried the in-
mates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-
trees, probably, which was mentioned as standing
near. In this way he found the place deserted. I
shall be very much surprised, however, if it still so
when he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you
think of my theory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all surmise.&#8221;
&#8220;But at least it covers all the facts. When new
</p>
<p>facts come to our knowledge which cannot be cov-
ered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it.
We can do nothing more until we have a message
from our friend at Norbury.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But we had not a very long time to wait for
that. It came just as we had finished our tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cottage is still tenanted,&#8221; it said.
&#8220;Have seen the face again at the win-
dow. Will meet the seven o&#8217;clock train,
and will take no steps until you arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was waiting on the platform when we
stepped out, and we could see in the light of the
station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering
with agitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are still there, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, lay-
ing his hand hard upon my friend&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;I saw
lights in the cottage as I came down. We shall set-
tle it now once and for all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your plan, then?&#8221; asked Holmes, as
he walked down the dark tree-lined road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to force my way in and see for my-
self who is in the house. I wish you both to be
there as witnesses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite determined to do this, in spite
of your wife&#8217;s warning that it is better that you
should not solve the mystery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am determined.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I think that you are in the right. Any
</p>
<p>truth is better than indefinite doubt. We had bet-
ter go up at once. Of course, legally, we are putting
ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but I think that
it is worth it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a very dark night, and a thin rain be-
gan to fall as we turned from the high road into
a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on ei-
ther side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently
forward, however, and we stumbled after him as
best we could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the lights of my house,&#8221; he mur-
mured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees.
&#8220;And here is the cottage which I am going to en-
ter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>301</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Yellow Face
</p>
<p>We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke,
and there was the building close beside us. A yel-
low bar falling across the black foreground showed
that the door was not quite closed, and one win-
dow in the upper story was brightly illuminated.
As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across
the blind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is that creature!&#8221; cried Grant Munro.
&#8220;You can see for yourselves that some one is there.
Now follow me, and we shall soon know all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We approached the door; but suddenly a
woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in
the golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see
her face in the he darkness, but her arms were
thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t Jack!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I had
a presentiment that you would come this evening.
Think better of it, dear! Trust me again, and you
will never have cause to regret it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have trusted you too long, Effie,&#8221; he cried,
sternly. &#8220;Leave go of me! I must pass you. My
friends and I are going to settle this matter once
and forever!&#8221; He pushed her to one side, and we
followed closely after him. As he threw the door
open an old woman ran out in front of him and
tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back,
and an instant afterwards we were all upon the
stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room
at the top, and we entered at his heels.
</p>
<p>It was a cosy, well-furnished apartment, with
two candles burning upon the table and two upon
the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a
desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl.
Her face was turned away as we entered, but we
could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and
that she had long white gloves on. As she whisked
round to us, I gave a cry of surprise and hor-
ror. The face which she turned towards us was
of the strangest livid tint, and the features were
absolutely devoid of any expression. An instant
later the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a
laugh, passed his hand behind the child&#8217;s ear, a
mask peeled off from her countenance, an there
was a little coal black negress, with all her white
teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I
burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her mer-
riment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his
hand clutching his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What can be the meaning
of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you the meaning of it,&#8221; cried the
lady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set
face. &#8220;You have forced me, against my own judg-
ment, to tell you, and now we must both make the
</p>
<p>best of it. My husband died at Atlanta. M
