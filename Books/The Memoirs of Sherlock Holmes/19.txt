<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>O</p>
<p>ne summer night, a few months after
my marriage, I was seated by my own
hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding
over a novel, for my day&#8217;s work had been
</p>
<p>an exhausting one. My wife had already gone up-
stairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door
some time before told me that the servants had
also retired. I had risen from my seat and was
knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I sud-
denly heard the clang of the bell.
</p>
<p>I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve.
This could not be a visitor at so late an hour. A
patient, evidently, and possibly an all-night sit-
ting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and
opened the door. To my astonishment it was Sher-
lock Holmes who stood upon my step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I hoped that I might
not be too late to catch you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, pray come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look surprised, and no wonder! Relieved,
too, I fancy! Hum! You still smoke the Arcadia
mixture of your bachelor days then! There&#8217;s no
mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat. It&#8217;s easy
to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a
uniform, Watson. You&#8217;ll never pass as a pure-bred
civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying
your handkerchief in your sleeve. Could you put
me up tonight?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me that you had bachelor quarters
for one, and I see that you have no gentleman visi-
tor at present. Your hat-stand proclaims as much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted if you will stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll fill the vacant peg then. Sorry
to see that you&#8217;ve had the British workman in the
house. He&#8217;s a token of evil. Not the drains, I
hope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the gas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! He has left two nail-marks from his boot
upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it.
No, thank you, I had some supper at Waterloo, but
I&#8217;ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself
opposite to me and smoked for some time in si-
lence. I was well aware that nothing but business
of importance would have brought him to me at
such an hour, so I waited patiently until he should
come round to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that you are professionally rather busy
just now,&#8221; said he, glancing very keenly across at
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve had a busy day,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It may
seem very foolish in your eyes,&#8221; I added, &#8220;but re-
ally I don&#8217;t know how you deduced it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes chuckled to himself.
&#8220;I have the advantage of knowing your habits,
</p>
<p>my dear Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When your round is a
short one you walk, and when it is a long one you
use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, al-
though used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt
that you are at present busy enough to justify the
hansom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Elementary,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is one of those in-
</p>
<p>stances where the reasoner can produce an effect
which seems remarkable to his neighbor, because
the latter has missed the one little point which
is the basis of the deduction. The same may be
said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these
little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretri-
cious, depending as it does upon your retaining
in your own hands some factors in the problem
which are never imparted to the reader. Now, at
present I am in the position of these same readers,
for I hold in this hand several threads of one of
the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man&#8217;s
brain, and yet I lack the one or two which are
needful to complete my theory. But I&#8217;ll have them,
Watson, I&#8217;ll have them!&#8221; His eyes kindled and a
slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an
instant the veil had lifted upon his keen, intense
nature, but for an instant only. When I glanced
again his face had resumed that red-Indian com-
posure which had made so many regard him as a
machine rather than a man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem presents features of interest,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I may even say exceptional features of
interest. I have already looked into the matter, and
have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.
If you could accompany me in that last step you
might be of considerable service to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be delighted.&#8221;
&#8220;Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?&#8221;
&#8220;I have no doubt Jackson would take my prac-
</p>
<p>tice.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good. I want to start by the 11.10 from
</p>
<p>Waterloo.&#8221;
&#8220;That would give me time.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you
</p>
<p>a sketch of what has happened, and of what re-
mains to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sleepy before you came. I am quite
wakeful now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will compress the story as far as may be done
without omitting anything vital to the case. It is
</p>
<p>355</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Crooked Man
</p>
<p>conceivable that you may even have read some ac-
count of the matter. It is the supposed murder of
Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Alder-
shot, which I am investigating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing of it.&#8221;
&#8220;It has not excited much attention yet, except
</p>
<p>locally. The facts are only two days old. Briefly
they are these:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of
the most famous Irish regiments in the British
army. It did wonders both in the Crimea and the
Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself
upon every possible occasion. It was commanded
up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant
veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time
of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regi-
ment in which he had once carried a musket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Barclay had married at the time when
he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden
name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
a former color-sergeant in the same corps. There
was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little so-
cial friction when the young couple (for they were
still young) found themselves in their new sur-
roundings. They appear, however, to have quickly
adapted themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always,
I understand, been as popular with the ladies of
the regiment as her husband was with his brother
officers. I may add that she was a woman of great
beauty, and that even now, when she has been mar-
ried for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a
striking and queenly appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Barclay&#8217;s family life appears to have
been a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to
whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he
has never heard of any misunderstanding between
the pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay&#8217;s
devotion to his wife was greater than his wife&#8217;s
to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if he were ab-
sent from her for a day. She, on the other hand,
though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively
affectionate. But they were regarded in the regi-
ment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.
There was absolutely nothing in their mutual rela-
tions to prepare people for the tragedy which was
to follow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had
some singular traits in his character. He was a
dashing, jovial old solder in his usual mood, but
there were occasions on which he seemed to show
himself capable of considerable violence and vin-
dictiveness. This side of his nature, however, ap-
pears never to have been turned towards his wife.
</p>
<p>Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and
three out of five of the other officers with whom
I conversed, was the singular sort of depression
which came upon him at times. As the major ex-
pressed it, the smile had often been struck from
his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he
has been joining the gaieties and chaff of the mess-
table. For days on end, when the mood was on
him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. This
and a certain tinge of superstition were the only
unusual traits in his character which his brother
officers had observed. The latter peculiarity took
the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially
after dark. This puerile feature in a nature which
was conspicuously manly had often given rise to
comment and conjecture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first battalion of the Royal Munsters
(which is the old 117th) has been stationed at
Aldershot for some years. The married officers live
out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this
time occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a
mile from the north camp. The house stands in its
own grounds, but the west side of it is not more
than thirty yards from the high-road. A coachman
and two maids form the staff of servants. These
with their master and mistress were the sole occu-
pants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children,
nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the events at Lachine between nine
and ten on the evening of last Monday.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the
Roman Catholic Church, and had interested her-
self very much in the establishment of the Guild of
St. George, which was formed in connection with
the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supply-
ing the poor with cast-off clothing. A meeting of
the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and
Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order
to be present at it. When leaving the house she
was heard by the coachman to make some com-
monplace remark to her husband, and to assure
him that she would be back before very long. She
then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who
lives in the next villa, and the two went off to-
gether to their meeting. It lasted forty minutes,
and at a quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned
home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as
she passed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a room which is used as a morning-
room at Lachine. This faces the road and opens by
a large glass folding-door on to the lawn. The lawn
is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. It
was into this room that Mrs. Barclay went upon
her return. The blinds were not down, for the
</p>
<p>356</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs.
Barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell,
asking Jane Stewart, the house-maid, to bring her
a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual
habits. The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-
room, but hearing that his wife had returned he
joined her in the morning-room. The coachman
saw him cross the hall and enter it. He was never
seen again alive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tea which had been ordered was brought
up at the end of ten minutes; but the maid, as
she approached the door, was surprised to hear
the voices of her master and mistress in furious al-
tercation. She knocked without receiving any an-
swer, and even turned the handle, but only to find
that the door was locked upon the inside. Natu-
rally enough she ran down to tell the cook, and
the two women with the coachman came up into
the hall and listened to the dispute which was still
raging. They all agreed that only two voices were
to be heard, those of Barclay and of his wife. Bar-
clay&#8217;s remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that
none of them were audible to the listeners. The
lady&#8217;s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and
when she raised her voice could be plainly heard.
&#8216;You coward!&#8217; she repeated over and over again.
&#8216;What can be done now? What can be done now?
Give me back my life. I will never so much as
breathe the same air with you again! You coward!
You Coward!&#8217; Those were scraps of her conversa-
tion, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man&#8217;s
voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from
the woman. Convinced that some tragedy had
occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and
strove to force it, while scream after scream issued
from within. He was unable, however, to make his
way in, and the maids were too distracted with
fear to be of any assistance to him. A sudden
thought struck him, however, and he ran through
the hall door and round to the lawn upon which
the long French windows open. One side of the
window was open, which I understand was quite
usual in the summer-time, and he passed without
difficulty into the room. His mistress had ceased to
scream and was stretched insensible upon a couch,
while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-
chair, and his head upon the ground near the cor-
ner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier
stone dead in a pool of his own blood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, the coachman&#8217;s first thought, on
finding that he could do nothing for his master,
was to open the door. But here an unexpected
and singular difficulty presented itself. The key
was not in the inner side of the door, nor could
he find it anywhere in the room. He went out
</p>
<p>again, therefore, through the window, and having
obtained the help of a policeman and of a med-
ical man, he returned. The lady, against whom
naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was re-
moved to her room, still in a state of insensibility.
The Colonel&#8217;s body was then placed upon the sofa,
and a careful examination made of the scene of the
tragedy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The injury from which the unfortunate vet-
eran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut
some two inches long at the back part of his head,
which had evidently been caused by a violent
blow from a blunt weapon. Nor was it difficult
to guess what that weapon may have been. Upon
the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular
club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The
Colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons
brought from the different countries in which he
had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that
his club was among his trophies. The servants
deny having seen it before, but among the numer-
ous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may
have been overlooked. Nothing else of importance
was discovered in the room by the police, save the
inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay&#8217;s
person nor upon that of the victim nor in any part
of the room was the missing key to be found. The
door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith
from Aldershot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the state of things, Watson, when
upon the Tuesday morning I, at the request of Ma-
jor Murphy, went down to Aldershot to supple-
ment the efforts of the police. I think that you will
acknowledge that the problem was already one of
interest, but my observations soon made me real-
ize that it was in truth much more extraordinary
than would at first sight appear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before examining the room I cross-questioned
the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the
facts which I have already stated. One other detail
of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
housemaid. You will remember that on hearing
the sound of the quarrel she descended and re-
turned with the other servants. On that first occa-
sion, when she was alone, she says that the voices
of her master and mistress were sunk so low that
she could hear hardly anything, and judged by
their tones rather than their words that they had
fallen out. On my pressing her, however, she re-
membered that she heard the word David uttered
twice by the lady. The point is of the utmost im-
portance as guiding us towards the reason of the
sudden quarrel. The Colonel&#8217;s name, you remem-
ber, was James.
</p>
<p>357</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Crooked Man
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one thing in the case which had
made the deepest impression both upon the ser-
vants and the police. This was the contortion of
the Colonel&#8217;s face. It had set, according to their
account, into the most dreadful expression of fear
and horror which a human countenance is capa-
ble of assuming. More than one person fainted at
the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. It
was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and
that it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of
course, fitted in well enough with the police the-
ory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making
a murderous attack upon him. Nor was the fact of
the wound being on the back of his head a fatal
objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid
the blow. No information could be got from the
lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an
acute attack of brain-fever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the police I learned that Miss Morri-
son, who you remember went out that evening
with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge
of what it was which had caused the ill-humor in
which her companion had returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Having gathered these facts, Watson, I
smoked several pipes over them, trying to sepa-
rate those which were crucial from others which
were merely incidental. There could be no ques-
tion that the most distinctive and suggestive point
in the case was the singular disappearance of the
door-key. A most careful search had failed to dis-
cover it in the room. Therefore it must have been
taken from it. But neither the Colonel nor the
Colonel&#8217;s wife could have taken it. That was per-
fectly clear. Therefore a third person must have
entered the room. And that third person could
only have come in through the window. It seemed
to me that a careful examination of the room and
the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this
mysterious individual. You know my methods,
Watson. There was not one of them which I did
not apply to the inquiry. And it ended by my dis-
covering traces, but very different ones from those
which I had expected. There had been a man in the
room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from
the road. I was able to obtain five very clear im-
pressions of his foot-marks: one in the roadway
itself, at the point where he had climbed the low
wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones
upon the stained boards near the window where
he had entered. He had apparently rushed across
the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper than
his heels. But it was not the man who surprised
me. It was his companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His companion!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out
of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his
knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that?&#8221; he asked.
The paper was covered with the tracings of
</p>
<p>the foot-marks of some small animal. It had five
well-marked foot-pads, an indication of long nails,
and the whole print might be nearly as large as a
dessert-spoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dog,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Did you ever hear of a dog running up a cur-
</p>
<p>tain? I found distinct traces that this creature had
done so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A monkey, then?&#8221;
&#8220;But it is not the print of a monkey.&#8221;
&#8220;What can it be, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any crea-
</p>
<p>ture that we are familiar with. I have tried to re-
construct it from the measurements. Here are four
prints where the beast has been standing motion-
less. You see that it is no less than fifteen inches
from fore-foot to hind. Add to that the length of
neck and head, and you get a creature not much
less than two feet long&#8212;probably more if there
is any tail. But now observe this other measure-
ment. The animal has been moving, and we have
the length of its stride. In each case it is only about
three inches. You have an indication, you see, of a
long body with very short legs attached to it. It
has not been considerate enough to leave any of
its hair behind it. But its general shape must be
what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain,
and it is carnivorous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you deduce that?&#8221;
&#8220;Because it ran up the curtain. A canary&#8217;s cage
</p>
<p>was hanging in the window, and its aim seems to
have been to get at the bird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what was the beast?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a
</p>
<p>long way towards solving the case. On the whole,
it was probably some creature of the weasel and
stoat tribe&#8212;and yet it is larger than any of these
that I have seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what had it to do with the crime?&#8221;
&#8220;That, also, is still obscure. But we have
</p>
<p>learned a good deal, you perceive. We know that
a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel be-
tween the Barclays&#8212;the blinds were up and the
room lighted. We know, also, that he ran across the
lawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange
animal, and that he either struck the Colonel or,
as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down
from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his
</p>
<p>358</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>head on the corner of the fender. Finally, we have
the curious fact that the intruder carried away the
key with him when he left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your discoveries seem to have left the business
more obscure that it was before,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. They undoubtedly showed that the
affair was much deeper than was at first conjec-
tured. I thought the matter over, and I came to the
conclusion that I must approach the case from an-
other aspect. But really, Watson, I am keeping you
up, and I might just as well tell you all this on our
way to Aldershot to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, you have gone rather too far to
stop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left
the house at half-past seven she was on good terms
with her husband. She was never, as I think I
have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was
heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel
in a friendly fashion. Now, it was equally certain
that, immediately on her return, she had gone to
the room in which she was least likely to see her
husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman
will, and finally, on his coming in to her, had bro-
ken into violent recriminations. Therefore some-
thing had occurred between seven-thirty and nine
o&#8217;clock which had completely altered her feelings
towards him. But Miss Morrison had been with
her during the whole of that hour and a half. It
was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her
denial, that she must know something of the mat-
ter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My first conjecture was, that possibly there
had been some passages between this young lady
and the old soldier, which the former had now
confessed to the wife. That would account for
the angry return, and also for the girl&#8217;s denial
that anything had occurred. Nor would it be en-
tirely incompatible with most of the words over-
head. But there was the reference to David, and
there was the known affection of the Colonel for
his wife, to weigh against it, to say nothing of the
tragic intrusion of this other man, which might,
of course, be entirely disconnected with what had
gone before. It was not easy to pick one&#8217;s steps,
but, on the whole, I was inclined to dismiss the
idea that there had been anything between the
Colonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever
convinced that the young lady held the clue as to
what it was which had turned Mrs. Barclay to ha-
tred of her husband. I took the obvious course,
therefore, of calling upon Miss M., of explaining
to her that I was perfectly certain that she held the
facts in her possession, and of assuring her that
</p>
<p>her friend, Mrs. Barclay, might find herself in the
dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were
cleared up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Morrison is a little ethereal slip of a girl,
with timid eyes and blond hair, but I found her
by no means wanting in shrewdness and common-
sense. She sat thinking for some time after I had
spoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of
resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement
which I will condense for your benefit.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I promised my friend that I would say noth-
ing of the matter, and a promise is a promise,&#8217;
said she; &#8216;but if I can really help her when so
serious a charge is laid against her, and when
her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness,
then I think I am absolved from my promise. I
will tell you exactly what happened upon Monday
evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;We were returning from the Watt Street Mis-
sion about a quarter to nine o&#8217;clock. On our way
we had to pass through Hudson Street, which is a
very quiet thoroughfare. There is only one lamp in
it, upon the left-hand side, and as we approached
this lamp I saw a man coming towards us with
is back very bent, and something like a box slung
over one of his shoulders. He appeared to be de-
formed, for he carried his head low and walked
with his knees bent. We were passing him when
he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light
thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped
and screamed out in a dreadful voice, &#8220;My God,
it&#8217;s Nancy!&#8221; Mrs. Barclay turned as white as death,
and would have fallen down had the dreadful-
looking creature not caught hold of her. I was go-
ing to call for the police, but she, to my surprise,
spoke quite civilly to the fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I thought you had been dead this thirty
years, Henry,&#8221; said she, in a shaking voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;So I have,&#8221; said he, and it was awful to hear
the tones that he said it in. He had a very dark,
fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes
back to me in my dreams. His hair and whiskers
were shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled
and puckered like a withered apple.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Just walk on a little way, dear,&#8221; said Mrs.
Barclay; &#8220;I want to have a word with this man.
There is nothing to be afraid of.&#8221; She tried to speak
boldly, but she was still deadly pale and could
hardly get her words out for the trembling of her
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I did as she asked me, and they talked to-
gether for a few minutes. Then she came down
</p>
<p>359</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Crooked Man
</p>
<p>the street with her eyes blazing, and I saw the crip-
pled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shak-
ing his clenched fists in the air as if he were made
with rage. She never said a word until we were at
the door here, when she took me by the hand and
begged me to tell no one what had happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;It&#8217;s an old acquaintance of mine who has
come down in the world,&#8221; said she. When I
promised her I would say nothing she kissed me,
and I have never seen her since. I have told you
now the whole truth, and if I withheld it from the
police it is because I did not realize then the danger
in which my dear friend stood. I know that it can
only be to her advantage that everything should
be known.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was her statement, Watson, and to me,
as you can imagine, it was like a light on a dark
night. Everything which had been disconnected
before began at once to assume its true place, and
I had a shadowy presentiment of the whole se-
quence of events. My next step obviously was to
find the man who had produced such a remark-
able impression upon Mrs. Barclay. If he were still
in Aldershot it should not be a very difficult mat-
ter. There are not such a very great number of
civilians, and a deformed man was sure to have
attracted attention. I spent a day in the search, and
by evening&#8212;this very evening, Watson&#8212;I had run
him down. The man&#8217;s name is Henry Wood, and
he lives in lodgings in this same street in which
the ladies met him. He has only been five days in
the place. In the character of a registration-agent
I had a most interesting gossip with his landlady.
The man is by trade a conjurer and performer, go-
ing round the canteens after nightfall, and giving a
little entertainment at each. He carries some crea-
ture about with him in that box; about which the
landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation,
for she had never seen an animal like it. He uses
it in some of his tricks according to her account.
So much the woman was able to tell me, and also
that it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how
twisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange
tongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights
she had heard him groaning and weeping in his
bedroom. He was all right, as far as money went,
but in his deposit he had given her what looked
like a bad florin. She showed it to me, Watson,
and it was an Indian rupee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how
we stand and why it is I want you. It is perfectly
plain that after the ladies parted from this man he
followed them at a distance, that he saw the quar-
rel between husband and wife through the win-
dow, that he rushed in, and that the creature which
</p>
<p>he carried in his box got loose. That is all very cer-
tain. But he is the only person in this world who
can tell us exactly what happened in that room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you intend to ask him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly&#8212;but in the presence of a wit-
ness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am the witness?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will be so good. If he can clear the mat-
ter up, well and good. If he refuses, we have no
alternative but to apply for a warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you know he&#8217;ll be there when we
return?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure that I took some precau-
tions. I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting
guard over him who would stick to him like a burr,
go where he might. We shall find him in Hudson
Street to-morrow, Watson, and meanwhile I should
be the criminal myself if I kept you out of bed any
longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was midday when we found ourselves at the
scene of the tragedy, and, under my companion&#8217;s
guidance, we made our way at once to Hudson
Street. In spite of his capacity for concealing his
emotions, I could easily see that Holmes was in a
state of suppressed excitement, while I was myself
tingling with that half-sporting, half-intellectual
pleasure which I invariably experienced when I as-
sociated myself with him in his investigations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the street,&#8221; said he, as we turned into
a short thoroughfare lined with plain two-storied
brick houses. &#8220;Ah, here is Simpson to report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in all right, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; cried a small
street Arab, running up to us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, Simpson!&#8221; said Holmes, patting him
on the head. &#8220;Come along, Watson. This is the
house.&#8221; He sent in his card with a message that he
had come on important business, and a moment
later we were face to face with the man whom we
had come to see. In spite of the warm weather he
was crouching over a fire, and the little room was
like an oven. The man sat all twisted and hud-
dled in his chair in a way which gave an indescrib-
ably impression of deformity; but the face which
he turned towards us, though worn and swarthy,
must at some time have been remarkable for its
beauty. He looked suspiciously at us now out of
yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or
rising, he waved towards two chairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Henry Wood, late of India, I believe,&#8221; said
Holmes, affably. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come over this little matter
of Colonel Barclay&#8217;s death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What should I know about that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>360</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to ascertain. You know, I
suppose, that unless the matter is cleared up, Mrs.
Barclay, who is an old friend of yours, will in all
probability be tried for murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man gave a violent start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you are,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;nor
how you come to know what you do know, but
will you swear that this is true that you tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they are only waiting for her to come to
her senses to arrest her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! Are you in the police yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What business is it of yours, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s every man&#8217;s business to see justice done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take my word that she is innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who killed Colonel James Barclay, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a just providence that killed him. But,
mind you this, that if I had knocked his brains
out, as it was in my heart to do, he would have
had no more than his due from my hands. If his
own guilty conscience had not struck him down it
is likely enough that I might have had his blood
upon my soul. You want me to tell the story. Well,
I don&#8217;t know why I shouldn&#8217;t, for there&#8217;s no cause
for me to be ashamed of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in this way, sir. You see me now with
my back like a camel and by ribs all awry, but there
was a time when Corporal Henry Wood was the
smartest man in the 117th foot. We were in India
then, in cantonments, at a place we&#8217;ll call Bhurtee.
Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in
the same company as myself, and the belle of the
regiment, ay, and the finest girl that ever had the
breath of life between her lips, was Nancy Devoy,
the daughter of the color-sergeant. There were two
men that loved her, and one that she loved, and
you&#8217;ll smile when you look at this poor thing hud-
dled before the fire, and hear me say that it was
for my good looks that she loved me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, though I had her heart, her father was
set upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-
scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an educa-
tion, and was already marked for the sword-belt.
But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I
would have had her when the Mutiny broke out,
and all hell was loose in the country.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of
us with half a battery of artillery, a company of
Sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. There
</p>
<p>were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were
as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. About
the second week of it our water gave out, and it
was a question whether we could communicate
with General Neill&#8217;s column, which was moving
up country. It was our only chance, for we could
not hope to fight our way out with all the women
and children, so I volunteered to go out and to
warn General Neill of our danger. My offer was
accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Bar-
clay, who was supposed to know the ground better
than any other man, and who drew up a route by
which I might get through the rebel lines. At ten
o&#8217;clock the same night I started off upon my jour-
ney. There were a thousand lives to save, but it was
of only one that I was thinking when I dropped
over the wall that night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My way ran down a dried-up watercourse,
which we hoped would screen me from the en-
emy&#8217;s sentries; but as I crept round the corner of it
I walked right into six of them, who were crouch-
ing down in the dark waiting for me. In an instant
I was stunned with a blow and bound hand and
foot. But the real blow was to my heart and not to
my head, for as I came to and listened to as much
as I could understand of their talk, I heard enough
to tell me that my comrade, the very man who had
arranged the way that I was to take, had betrayed
me by means of a native servant into the hands of
the enemy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no need for me to dwell on that
part of it. You know now what James Barclay was
capable of. Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day,
but the rebels took me away with them in their re-
treat, and it was many a long year before ever I
saw a white face again. I was tortured and tried to
get away, and was captured and tortured again.
You can see for yourselves the state in which I
was left. Some of them that fled into Nepal took
me with them, and then afterwards I was up past
Darjeeling. The hill-folk up there murdered the
rebels who had me, and I became their slave for a
time until I escaped; but instead of going south I
had to go north, until I found myself among the
Afghans. There I wandered about for many a year,
and at last came back to the Punjaub, where I lived
mostly among the natives and picked up a living
by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What
use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back
to England or to make myself known to my old
comrades? Even my wish for revenge would not
make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and
my old pals should think of Harry Wood as hav-
ing died with a straight back, than see him living
and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. They
</p>
<p>361</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that
they never should. I heard that Barclay had mar-
ried Nancy, and that he was rising rapidly in the
regiment, but even that did not make me speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But when one gets old one has a longing for
home. For years I&#8217;ve been dreaming of the bright
green fields and the hedges of England. At last
I determined to see them before I died. I saved
enough to bring me across, and then I came here
where the soldiers are, for I know their ways and
how to amuse them and so earn enough to keep
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your narrative is most interesting,&#8221; said Sher-
lock Holmes. &#8220;I have already heard of your meet-
ing with Mrs. Barclay, and your mutual recogni-
tion. You then, as I understand, followed her home
and saw through the window an altercation be-
tween her husband and her, in which she doubt-
less cast his conduct to you in his teeth. Your
own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the
lawn and broke in upon them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as
I have never seen a man look before, and over he
went with his head on the fender. But he was dead
before he fell. I read death on his face as plain as
I can read that text over the fire. The bare sight of
me was like a bullet through his guilty heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Nancy fainted, and I caught up the key
of the door from her hand, intending to unlock it
and get help. But as I was doing it it seemed to me
better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing
might look black against me, and any way my se-
cret would be out if I were taken. In my haste I
thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my
stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up
the curtain. When I got him into his box, from
which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could
run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Teddy?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>The man leaned over and pulled up the front
of a kind of hutch in the corner. In an instant out
there s
