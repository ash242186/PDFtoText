<p>n anomaly which often struck me in the
character of my friend Sherlock Holmes
was that, although in his methods of
thought he was the neatest and most me-
</p>
<p>thodical of mankind, and although also he affected
a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the
less in his personal habits one of the most un-
tidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to dis-
traction. Not that I am in the least conventional in
that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work
in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural
Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather
more lax than befits a medical man. But with me
there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps
his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe
end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered corre-
spondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very
centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to
give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too,
that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-
air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer
humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-
trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and pro-
ceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.
R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room
was improved by it.
</p>
<p>Our chambers were always full of chemicals
and of criminal relics which had a way of wan-
dering into unlikely positions, and of turning up
in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places.
But his papers were my great crux. He had a
horror of destroying documents, especially those
which were connected with his past cases, and yet
it was only once in every year or two that he would
muster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as
I have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent
memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when
he performed the remarkable feats with which his
name is associated were followed by reactions of
lethargy during which he would lie about with his
violin and his books, hardly moving save from the
sofa to the table. Thus month after month his pa-
pers accumulated, until every corner of the room
was stacked with bundles of manuscript which
were on no account to be burned, and which could
not be put away save by their owner. One winter&#8217;s
night, as we sat together by the fire, I ventured
to suggest to him that, as he had finished past-
ing extracts into his common-place book, he might
employ the next two hours in making our room a
little more habitable. He could not deny the jus-
tice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he
went off to his bedroom, from which he returned
presently pulling a large tin box behind him. This
</p>
<p>he placed in the middle of the floor and, squatting
down upon a stool in front of it, he threw back the
lid. I could see that it was already a third full of
bundles of paper tied up with red tape into sepa-
rate packages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are cases enough here, Watson,&#8221; said
he, looking at me with mischievous eyes. &#8220;I think
that if you knew all that I had in this box you
would ask me to pull some out instead of putting
others in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the records of your early work,
then?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I have often wished that I had
notes of those cases.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely
before my biographer had come to glorify me.&#8221; He
lifted bundle after bundle in a tender, caressing
sort of way. &#8220;They are not all successes, Watson,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But there are some pretty little prob-
lems among them. Here&#8217;s the record of the Tar-
leton murders, and the case of Vamberry, the wine
merchant, and the adventure of the old Russian
woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium
crutch, as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the
club-foot, and his abominable wife. And here&#8212;ah,
now, this really is something a little recherche&#180;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dived his arm down to the bottom of the
chest, and brought up a small wooden box with
a sliding lid, such as children&#8217;s toys are kept in.
From within he produced a crumpled piece of pa-
per, and old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood
with a ball of string attached to it, and three rusty
old disks of metal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?&#8221;
he asked, smiling at my expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a curious collection.&#8221;
&#8220;Very curious, and the story that hangs round
</p>
<p>it will strike you as being more curious still.&#8221;
&#8220;These relics have a history then?&#8221;
&#8220;So much so that they are history.&#8221;
&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;
Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one,
</p>
<p>and laid them along the edge of the table. Then he
reseated himself in his chair and looked them over
with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are all that I have left to re-
mind me of the adventure of the Musgrave Ritual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had heard him mention the case more than
once, though I had never been able to gather the
details. &#8220;I should be so glad,&#8221; said I, &#8220;if you would
give me an account of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave the litter as it is?&#8220; he cried, mis-
chievously. &#8220;Your tidiness won&#8217;t bear much strain
after all, Watson. But I should be glad that you
</p>
<p>331</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Musgrave Ritual
</p>
<p>should add this case to your annals, for there are
points in it which make it quite unique in the
criminal records of this or, I believe, of any other
country. A collection of my trifling achievements
would certainly be incomplete which contained no
account of this very singular business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may remember how the affair of the Glo-
ria Scott, and my conversation with the unhappy
man whose fate I told you of, first turned my at-
tention in the direction of the profession which has
become my life&#8217;s work. You see me now when my
name has become known far and wide, and when
I am generally recognized both by the public and
by the official force as being a final court of ap-
peal in doubtful cases. Even when you knew me
first, at the time of the affair which you have com-
memorated in &#8216;A Study in Scarlet,&#8217; I had already
established a considerable, though not a very lu-
crative, connection. You can hardly realize, then,
how difficult I found it at first, and how long I had
to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first came up to London I had rooms
in Montague Street, just round the corner from the
British Museum, and there I waited, filling in my
too abundant leisure time by studying all those
branches of science which might make me more
efficient. Now and again cases came in my way,
principally through the introduction of old fellow-
students, for during my last years at the University
there was a good deal of talk there about myself
and my methods. The third of these cases was
that of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the inter-
est which was aroused by that singular chain of
events, and the large issues which proved to be at
stake, that I trace my first stride towards to the po-
sition which I now hold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reginald Musgrave had been in the same col-
lege as myself, and I had some slight acquaintance
with him. He was not generally popular among
the undergraduates, though it always seemed to
me that what was set down as pride was really an
attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence. In ap-
pearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic
type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with lan-
guid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a
scion of one of the very oldest families in the king-
dom, though his branch was a cadet one which
had separated from the northern Musgraves some
time in the sixteenth century, and had established
itself in western Sussex, where the Manor House
of Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited build-
ing in the county. Something of his birth place
seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at
his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without
</p>
<p>associating him with gray archways and mullioned
windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feu-
dal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk, and
I can remember that more than once he expressed
a keen interest in my methods of observation and
inference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For four years I had seen nothing of him un-
til one morning he walked into my room in Mon-
tague Street. He had changed little, was dressed
like a young man of fashion&#8212;he was always a bit
of a dandy&#8212;and preserved the same quiet, suave
manner which had formerly distinguished him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How has all gone with you Musgrave?&#8217; I
asked, after we had cordially shaken hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You probably heard of my poor father&#8217;s
death,&#8217; said he; &#8216;he was carried off about two years
ago. Since then I have of course had the Hurlstone
estates to manage, and as I am member for my
district as well, my life has been a busy one. But I
understand, Holmes, that you are turning to prac-
tical ends those powers with which you used to
amaze us?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I have taken to living by my
wits.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at
present would be exceedingly valuable to me. We
have had some very strange doings at Hurlstone,
and the police have been able to throw no light
upon the matter. It is really the most extraordi-
nary and inexplicable business.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine with what eagerness I lis-
tened to him, Watson, for the very chance for
which I had been panting during all those months
of inaction seemed to have come within my reach.
In my inmost heart I believed that I could succeed
where others failed, and now I had the opportu-
nity to test myself.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Pray, let me have the details,&#8217; I cried.
&#8220;Reginald Musgrave sat down opposite to me,
</p>
<p>and lit the cigarette which I had pushed towards
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You must know,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that though I am
a bachelor, I have to keep up a considerable staff
of servants at Hurlstone, for it is a rambling old
place, and takes a good deal of looking after. I
preserve, too, and in the pheasant months I usu-
ally have a house-party, so that it would not do to
be short-handed. Altogether there are eight maids,
the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy. The
garden and the stables of course have a separate
staff.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Of these servants the one who had been
longest in our service was Brunton the butler. He
was a young school-master out of place when he
</p>
<p>332</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>was first taken up by my father, but he was a man
of great energy and character, and he soon became
quite invaluable in the household. He was a well-
grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead,
and though he has been with us for twenty years
he cannot be more than forty now. With his per-
sonal advantages and his extraordinary gifts&#8212;for
he can speak several languages and play nearly
every musical instrument&#8212;it is wonderful that he
should have been satisfied so long in such a posi-
tion, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and
lacked energy to make any change. The butler of
Hurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by
all who visit us.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But this paragon has one fault. He is a bit
of a Don Juan, and you can imagine that for a
man like him it is not a very difficult part to play
in a quiet country district. When he was married
it was all right, but since he has been a widower
we have had no end of trouble with him. A few
months ago we were in hopes that he was about
to settle down again for he became engaged to
Rachel Howells, our second house-maid; but he
has thrown her over since then and taken up with
Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the head game-
keeper. Rachel&#8212;who is a very good girl, but of an
excitable Welsh temperament&#8212;had a sharp touch
of brain-fever, and goes about the house now&#8212;or
did until yesterday&#8212;like a black-eyed shadow of
her former self. That was our first drama at Hurl-
stone; but a second one came to drive it from our
minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and
dismissal of butler Brunton.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This was how it came about. I have said that
the man was intelligent, and this very intelligence
has caused his ruin, for it seems to have led to an
insatiable curiosity about things which did not in
the least concern him. I had no idea of the lengths
to which this would carry him, until the merest
accident opened my eyes to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have said that the house is a rambling one.
One day last week&#8212;on Thursday night, to be more
exact&#8212;I found that I could not sleep, having fool-
ishly taken a cup of strong cafe&#180; noir after my din-
ner. After struggling against it until two in the
morning, I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose
and lit the candle with the intention of continuing
a novel which I was reading. The book, however,
had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on
my dressing-gown and started off to get it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;In order to reach the billiard-room I had to
descend a flight of stairs and then to cross the head
of a passage which led to the library and the gun-
room. You can imagine my surprise when, as I
</p>
<p>looked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light
coming from the open door of the library. I had
myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door
before coming to bed. Naturally my first thought
was of burglars. The corridors at Hurlstone have
their walls largely decorated with trophies of old
weapons. From one of these I picked a battle-axe,
and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on
tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Brunton, the butler, was in the library. He
was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy-chair, with a
slip of paper which looked like a map upon his
knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his
hand in deep thought. I stood dumb with as-
tonishment, watching him from the darkness. A
small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble
light which sufficed to show me that he was fully
dressed. Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his
chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he
unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From
this he took a paper, and returning to his seat he
flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the
table, and began to study it with minute attention.
My indignation at this calm examination of our
family documents overcame me so far that I took
a step forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me
standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet,
his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into
his breast the chart-like paper which he had been
originally studying.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;So!&#8221; said I. &#8220;This is how you repay the trust
which we have reposed in you. You will leave my
service to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;He bowed with the look of a man who is ut-
terly crushed, and slunk past me without a word.
The taper was still on the table, and by its light
I glanced to see what the paper was which Brun-
ton had taken from the bureau. To my surprise it
was nothing of any importance at all, but simply
a copy of the questions and answers in the singu-
lar old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It
is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which
each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through
on his coming of age&#8212;a thing of private interest,
and perhaps of some little importance to the ar-
chaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges,
but of no practical use whatever.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;We had better come back to the paper after-
wards,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If you think it really necessary,&#8217; he answered,
with some hesitation. &#8216;To continue my statement,
however: I relocked the bureau, using the key
which Brunton had left, and I had turned to go
</p>
<p>333</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Musgrave Ritual
</p>
<p>when I was surprised to find that the butler had
returned, and was standing before me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Mr. Musgrave, sir,&#8221; he cried, in a voice
which was hoarse with emotion, &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear dis-
grace, sir. I&#8217;ve always been proud above my station
in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will
be on your head, sir&#8212;it will, indeed&#8212;if you drive
me to despair. If you cannot keep me after what
has passed, then for God&#8217;s sake let me give you
notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free
will. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to
be cast out before all the folk that I know so well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;You don&#8217;t deserve much consideration,
Brunton,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Your conduct has been
most infamous. However, as you have been a long
time in the family, I have no wish to bring pub-
lic disgrace upon you. A month, however is too
long. Take yourself away in a week, and give what
reason you like for going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Only a week, sir?&#8221; he cried, in a despairing
voice. &#8220;A fortnight&#8212;say at least a fortnight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;A week,&#8221; I repeated, &#8220;and you may con-
sider yourself to have been very leniently dealt
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast,
like a broken man, while I put out the light and
returned to my room.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;For two days after this Brunton was most as-
siduous in his attention to his duties. I made no al-
lusion to what had passed, and waited with some
curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.
On the third morning, however he did not appear,
as was his custom, after breakfast to receive my
instructions for the day. As I left the dining-room
I happened to meet Rachel Howells, the maid. I
have told you that she had only recently recovered
from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly
pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for be-
ing at work.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;You should be in bed,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Come back
to your duties when you are stronger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;She looked at me with so strange an expres-
sion that I began to suspect that her brain was af-
fected.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I am strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,&#8221; said
she.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;We will see what the doctor says,&#8221; I an-
swered. &#8220;You must stop work now, and when you
go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;The butler is gone,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Gone! Gone where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;He is gone. No one has seen him. He is not
in his room. Oh, yes, he is gone, he is gone!&#8221; She
fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of
laughter, while I, horrified at this sudden hysteri-
cal attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. The
girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sob-
bing, while I made inquiries about Brunton. There
was no doubt about it that he had disappeared.
His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by
no one since he had retired to his room the night
before, and yet it was difficult to see how he could
have left the house, as both windows and doors
were found to be fastened in the morning. His
clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his
room, but the black suit which he usually wore
was missing. His slippers, too, were gone, but his
boots were left behind. Where then could butler
Brunton have gone in the night, and what could
have become of him now?
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Of course we searched the house from cellar
to garret, but there was no trace of him. It is, as
I have said, a labyrinth of an old house, especially
the original wing, which is now practically unin-
habited; but we ransacked every room and cellar
without discovering the least sign of the missing
man. It was incredible to me that he could have
gone away leaving all his property behind him,
and yet where could he be? I called in the local
police, but without success. Rain had fallen on the
night before and we examined the lawn and the
paths all round the house, but in vain. Matters
were in this state, when a new development quite
drew our attention away from the original mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;For two days Rachel Howells had been so ill,
sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a
nurse had been employed to sit up with her at
night. On the third night after Brunton&#8217;s disap-
pearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping
nicely, had dropped into a nap in the arm-chair,
when she woke in the early morning to find the
bed empty, the window open, and no signs of the
invalid. I was instantly aroused, and, with the
two footmen, started off at once in search of the
missing girl. It was not difficult to tell the direc-
tion which she had taken, for, starting from under
her window, we could follow her footmarks eas-
ily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where
they vanished close to the gravel path which leads
out of the grounds. The lake there is eight feet
deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we
saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came
to an end at the edge of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Of course, we had the drags at once, and set
to work to recover the remains, but no trace of
</p>
<p>334</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>the body could we find. On the other hand, we
brought to the surface an object of a most unex-
pected kind. It was a linen bag which contained
within it a mass of old rusted and discolored metal
and several dull-colored pieces of pebble or glass.
This strange find was all that we could get from
the mere, and, although we made every possible
search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing
of the fate either of Rachel Howells or of Richard
Brunton. The county police are at their wits&#8217; end,
and I have come up to you as a last resource.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine, Watson, with what eager-
ness I listened to this extraordinary sequence of
events, and endeavored to piece them together,
and to devise some common thread upon which
they might all hang. The butler was gone. The
maid was gone. The maid had loved the butler,
but had afterwards had cause to hate him. She
was of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate. She had
been terribly excited immediately after his disap-
pearance. She had flung into the lake a bag con-
taining some curious contents. These were all fac-
tors which had to be taken into consideration, and
yet none of them got quite to the heart of the mat-
ter. What was the starting-point of this chain of
events? There lay the end of this tangled line.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I must see that paper, Musgrave,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;which this butler of your thought it worth his
while to consult, even at the risk of the loss of his
place.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is rather an absurd business, this ritual of
ours,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;But it has at least the saving
grace of antiquity to excuse it. I have a copy of the
questions and answers here if you care to run your
eye over them.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He handed me the very paper which I have
here, Watson, and this is the strange catechism to
which each Musgrave had to submit when he came
to man&#8217;s estate. I will read you the questions and
answers as they stand.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Whose was it?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;His who is gone.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Who shall have it?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;He who will come.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Where was the sun?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Over the oak.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Where was the shadow?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Under the elm.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;How was it stepped?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;North by ten and by ten, east by five and by
</p>
<p>five, south by two and by two, west by one and by
one, and so under.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What shall we give for it?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;All that is ours.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Why should we give it?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;For the sake of the trust.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;The original has no date, but is in the spelling
</p>
<p>of the middle of the seventeenth century,&#8217; re-
marked Musgrave. &#8216;I am afraid, however, that it
can be of little help to you in solving this mystery.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;At least,&#8217; said I, &#8216;it gives us another mystery,
and one which is even more interesting than the
first. It may be that the solution of the one may
prove to be the solution of the other. You will ex-
cuse me, Musgrave, if I say that your butler ap-
pears to me to have been a very clever man, and to
have had a clearer insight that ten generations of
his masters.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I hardly follow you,&#8217; said Musgrave. &#8216;The pa-
per seems to me to be of no practical importance.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But to me it seems immensely practical, and
I fancy that Brunton took the same view. He had
probably seen it before that night on which you
caught him.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is very possible. We took no pains to hide
it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;He simply wished, I should imagine, to re-
fresh his memory upon that last occasion. He had,
as I understand, some sort of map or chart which
he was comparing with the manuscript, and which
he thrust into his pocket when you appeared.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That is true. But what could he have to do
with this old family custom of ours, and what does
this rigmarole mean?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I don&#8217;t think that we should have much dif-
ficulty in determining that,&#8217; said I; &#8216;with your per-
mission we will take the first train down to Sussex,
and go a little more deeply into the matter upon
the spot.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same afternoon saw us both at Hurlstone.
Possibly you have seen pictures and read descrip-
tions of the famous old building, so I will con-
fine my account of it to saying that it is built in
the shape of an L, the long arm being the more
modern portion, and the shorter the ancient nu-
cleus, from which the other had developed. Over
the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of this
old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are
agreed that the beams and stone-work are really
much older than this. The enormously thick walls
and tiny windows of this part had in the last cen-
tury driven the family into building the new wing,
and the old one was used now as a store-house
and a cellar, when it was used at all. A splen-
did park with fine old timber surrounds the house,

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Musgrave Ritual
</p>
<p>and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay
close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from
the building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was already firmly convinced, Watson, that
there were not three separate mysteries here, but
one only, and that if I could read the Musgrave
Ritual aright I should hold in my hand the clue
which would lead me to the truth concerning both
the butler Brunton and the maid Howells. To that
then I turned all my energies. Why should this ser-
vant be so anxious to master this old formula? Ev-
idently because he saw something in it which had
escaped all those generations of country squires,
and from which he expected some personal advan-
tage. What was it then, and how had it affected his
fate?
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the
ritual, that the measurements must refer to some
spot to which the rest of the document alluded,
and that if we could find that spot, we should be
in a fair way towards finding what the secret was
which the old Musgraves had thought it necessary
to embalm in so curious a fashion. There were
two guides given us to start with, an oak and an
elm. As to the oak there could be no question at
all. Right in front of the house, upon the left-hand
side of the drive, there stood a patriarch among
oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have
ever seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That was there when your ritual was drawn
up,&#8217; said I, as we drove past it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It was there at the Norman Conquest in all
probability,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;It has a girth of twenty-
three feet.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here was one of my fixed points secured.
&#8220; &#8216;Have you any old elms?&#8217; I asked.
&#8220; &#8216;There used to be a very old one over yonder
</p>
<p>but it was struck by lightning ten years ago, and
we cut down the stump,&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You can see where it used to be?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Oh, yes.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;There are no other elms?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;No old ones, but plenty of beeches.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;I should like to see where it grew.&#8217;
&#8220;We had driven up in a dogcart, and my client
</p>
<p>led me away at once, without our entering the
house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had
stood. It was nearly midway between the oak and
the house. My investigation seemed to be pro-
gressing.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I suppose it is impossible to find out how
high the elm was?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I can give you it at once. It was sixty-four
feet.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How do you come to know it?&#8217; I asked, in
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;When my old tutor used to give me an ex-
ercise in trigonometry, it always took the shape of
measuring heights. When I was a lad I worked out
every tree and building in the estate.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was an unexpected piece of luck. My
data were coming more quickly than I could have
reasonably hoped.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Tell me,&#8217; I asked, &#8216;did your butler ever ask
you such a question?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reginald Musgrave looked at me in aston-
ishment. &#8216;Now that you call it to my mind,&#8217; he
answered, &#8216;Brunton did ask me about the height
of the tree some months ago, in connection with
some little argument with the groom.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was excellent news, Watson, for it
showed me that I was on the right road. I looked
up at the sun. It was low in the heavens, and I cal-
culated that in less than an hour it would lie just
above the topmost branches of the old oak. One
condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be
fulfilled. And the shadow of the elm must mean
the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk
would have been chosen as the guide. I had, then,
to find where the far end of the shadow would fall
when the sun was just clear of the oak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That must have been difficult, Holmes, when
the elm was no longer there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at least I knew that if Brunton could do
it, I could also. Besides, there was no real difficulty.
I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled
myself this peg, to which I tied this long string
with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths
of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and
I went back with my client to where the elm had
been. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak.
I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direc-
tion of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine
feet in length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the calculation now was a simple
one. If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a
tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-
six, and the line of the one would of course the line
of the other. I measured out the distance, which
brought me almost to the wall of the house, and
I thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my
exultation, Watson, when within two inches of my
peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I
knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his
measurements, and that I was still upon his trail.
</p>
<p>336</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;From this starting-point I proceeded to step,
having first taken the cardinal points by my
pocket-compass. Ten steps with each foot took me
along parallel with the wall of the house, and again
I marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully
paced off five to the east and two to the south. It
brought me to the very threshold of the old door.
Two steps to the west meant now that I was to
go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and
this was the place indicated by the Ritual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never have I felt such a cold chill of disap-
pointment, Watson. For a moment is seemed to
me that there must be some radical mistake in my
calculations. The setting sun shone full upon the
passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-
worn gray stones with which it was paved were
firmly cemented together, and had certainly not
been moved for many a long year. Brunton had
not been at work here. I tapped upon the floor,
but it sounded the same all over, and there was no
sign of any crack or crevice. But, Fortunately, Mus-
grave, who had begun to appreciate the meaning
of my proceedings, and who was now as excited
as myself, took out his manuscript to check my
calculation.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And under,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;You have omitted the
&#8220;and under.&#8221; &#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought that it meant that we were to
dig, but now, of course, I saw at once that I was
wrong. &#8216;There is a cellar under this then?&#8217; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes, and as old as the house. Down here,
through this door.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We went down a winding stone stair, and my
companion, striking a match, lit a large lantern
which stood on a barrel in the corner. In an in-
stant it was obvious that we had at last come upon
the true place, and that we had not been the only
people to visit the spot recently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It had been used for the storage of wood, but
the billets, which had evidently been littered over
the floor, were now piled at the sides, so as to leave
a clear space in the middle. In this space lay a large
and heavy flagstone with a rusted iron ring in the
centre to which a thick shepherd&#8217;s-check muffler
was attached.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;By Jove!&#8217; cried my client. &#8216;That&#8217;s Brunton&#8217;s
muffler. I have seen it on him, and could swear to
it. What has the villain been doing here?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At my suggestion a couple of the county po-
lice were summoned to be present, and I then en-
deavored to raise the stone by pulling on the cra-
vat. I could only move it slightly, and it was with
the aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at
</p>
<p>last in carrying it to one side. A black hole yawned
beneath into which we all peered, while Musgrave,
kneeling at the side, pushed down the lantern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A small chamber about seven feet deep and
four feet square lay open to us. At one side of
this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the lid
of which was hinged upwards, with this curious
old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was
furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp
and worms had eaten through the wood, so that a
crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it.
Several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such
as I hold here, were scattered over the bottom of
the box, but it contained nothing else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment, however, we had no thought
for the old chest, for our eyes were riveted upon
that which crouched beside it. It was the figure of
a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down
upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the
edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on
each side of it. The attitude had drawn all the stag-
nant blood to the face, and no man could have rec-
ognized that distorted liver-colored countenance;
but his height, his dress, and his hair were all suf-
ficient to show my client, when we had drawn the
body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. He
had been dead some days, but there was no wound
or bruise upon his person to show how he had met
his dreadful end. When his body had been carried
from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted
with a problem which was almost as formidable as
that with which we had started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess that so far, Watson, I had been disap-
pointed in my investigation. I had reckoned upon
solving the matter when once I had found the
place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was there,
and was apparently as far as ever from knowing
what it was which the family had concealed with
such elaborate precautions. It is true that I had
thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but now
I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon
him, and what part had been played in the matter
by the woman who had disappeared. I sat down
upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole
matter carefully over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my methods in such cases, Wat-
son. I put myself in the man&#8217;s place and, having
first gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how
I should myself have proceeded under the same
circumstances. In this case the matter was simpli-
fied by Brunton&#8217;s intelligence being quite first-rate,
so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance
for the personal equation, as the astronomers have
dubbed it. He knew that something valuable was
</p>
<p>337</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Musgrave Ritual
</p>
<p>concealed. He had spotted the place. He found
that the stone which covered it was just too heavy
for a man to move unaided. What would he do
next? He could not get help from outside, even
if he had some one whom he could trust, with-
out the unbarring of doors and considerable risk
of detection. It was better, if he could, to have his
helpmate inside the house. But whom could he
ask? This girl had been devoted to him. A man
always finds it hard to realize that he may have fi-
nally lost a woman&#8217;s love, however badly he may
have treated her. He would try by a few attentions
to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then
would engage her as his accomplice. Together they
would come at night to the cellar, and their united
force would suffice to raise the stone. So far I could
follow their actions as if I had actually seen them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But for two of them, and one a woman, it must
have been heavy work the raising of that stone. A
burly Sussex policeman and I had found it no light
job. What would they do to assist them? Probably
what I should have done myself. I rose and exam-
ined carefully the different billets of wood which
were scattered round the floor. Almost at once
I came upon what I expected. One piece, about
three feet in length, had a very marked indenta-
tion at one end, while several were flattened at the
sides as if they had been compressed by some con-
siderable weight. Evidently, as they had dragged
the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood
into the chink, until at last, when the opening was
large enough to crawl through, they would hold
it open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might
very well b
