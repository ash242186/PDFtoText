</div></div>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>S</p>
<p>hortly after my marriage I had bought
a connection in the Paddington district.
Old Mr. Farquhar, from whom I pur-
chased it, had at one time an excellent
</p>
<p>general practice; but his age, and an affliction of
the nature of St. Vitus&#8217;s dance from which he suf-
fered, had very much thinned it. The public not
unnaturally goes on the principle that he who
would heal others must himself be whole, and
looks askance at the curative powers of the man
whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs.
Thus as my predecessor weakened his practice de-
clined, until when I purchased it from him it had
sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three
hundred a year. I had confidence, however, in my
own youth and energy, and was convinced that in
a very few years the concern would be as flourish-
ing as ever.
</p>
<p>For three months after taking over the practice
I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of
my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I was too busy to
visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere
himself save upon professional business. I was sur-
prised, therefore, when, one morning in June, as I
sat reading the British Medical Journal after break-
fast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high,
somewhat strident tones of my old companion&#8217;s
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear Watson,&#8221; said he, striding into
the room, &#8220;I am very delighted to see you! I trust
that Mrs. Watson has entirely recovered from all
the little excitements connected with our adven-
ture of the Sign of Four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, we are both very well,&#8221; said I,
shaking him warmly by the hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope, also,&#8221; he continued, sitting down
in the rocking-chair, &#8220;that the cares of medical
practice have not entirely obliterated the interest
which you used to take in our little deductive
problems.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;it was only last
night that I was looking over my old notes, and
classifying some of our past results.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that you don&#8217;t consider your collection
closed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I should wish nothing better than
to have some more of such experiences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day, for example?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to-day, if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And as far off as Birmingham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you wish it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the practice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do my neighbor&#8217;s when he goes. He is al-
ways ready to work off the debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Nothing could be better,&#8221; said Holmes,
leaning back in his chair and looking keenly at me
from under his half closed lids. &#8220;I perceive that
you have been unwell lately. Summer colds are
always a little trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was confined to the house by a severe chill
for three days last week. I thought, however, that I
had cast off every trace of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have. You look remarkably robust.&#8221;
&#8220;How, then, did you know of it?&#8221;
&#8220;My dear fellow, you know my methods.&#8221;
&#8220;You deduced it, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;
&#8220;And from what?&#8221;
&#8220;From your slippers.&#8221;
I glanced down at the new patent leathers
</p>
<p>which I was wearing. &#8220;How on earth&#8212;&#8221; I began,
but Holmes answered my question before it was
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your slippers are new,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You could
not have had them more than a few weeks. The
soles which you are at this moment presenting to
me are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought
they might have got wet and been burned in the
drying. But near the instep there is a small circu-
lar wafer of paper with the shopman&#8217;s hieroglyph-
ics upon it. Damp would of course have removed
this. You had, then, been sitting with our feet out-
stretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do
even in so wet a June as this if he were in his full
health.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Like all Holmes&#8217;s reasoning the thing seemed
simplicity itself when it was once explained. He
read the thought upon my features, and his smile
had a tinge of bitterness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that I rather give myself away
when I explain,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Results without causes
are much more impressive. You are ready to come
to Birmingham, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. What is the case?&#8221;
&#8220;You shall hear it all in the train. My client is
</p>
<p>outside in a four-wheeler. Can you come at once?&#8221;
&#8220;In an instant.&#8221; I scribbled a note to my neigh-
</p>
<p>bor, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my
wife, and joined Holmes upon the door-step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your neighbor is a doctor,&#8221; said he, nodding
at the brass plate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he bought a practice as I did.&#8221;
&#8220;An old-established one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>307</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stock-Broker&#8217;s Clerk
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same as mine. Both have been ever
since the houses were built.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then you got hold of the best of the two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I did. But how do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the steps, my boy. Yours are worn three
inches deeper than his. But this gentleman in the
cab is my client, Mr. Hall Pycroft. Allow me to in-
troduce you to him. Whip your horse up, cabby,
for we have only just time to catch our train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man whom I found myself facing was a
well built, fresh-complexioned young fellow, with
a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow mus-
tache. He wore a very shiny top hat and a neat
suit of sober black, which made him look what
he was&#8212;a smart young City man, of the class
who have been labeled cockneys, but who give us
our crack volunteer regiments, and who turn out
more fine athletes and sportsmen than any body
of men in these islands. His round, ruddy face
was naturally full of cheeriness, but the corners of
his mouth seemed to me to be pulled down in a
half-comical distress. It was not, however, until we
were all in a first-class carriage and well started
upon our journey to Birmingham that I was able
to learn what the trouble was which had driven
him to Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a clear run here of seventy minutes,&#8221;
Holmes remarked. &#8220;I want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft,
to tell my friend your very interesting experience
exactly as you have told it to me, or with more de-
tail if possible. It will be of use to me to hear the
succession of events again. It is a case, Watson,
which may prove to have something in it, or may
prove to have nothing, but which, at least, presents
those unusual and outre&#180; features which are as dear
to you as they are to me. Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall
not interrupt you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our young companion looked at me with a
twinkle in his eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst of the story is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I
show myself up as such a confounded fool. Of
course it may work out all right, and I don&#8217;t see
that I could have done otherwise; but if I have lost
my crib and get nothing in exchange I shall feel
what a soft Johnnie I have been. I&#8217;m not very good
at telling a story, Dr. Watson, but it is like this with
me:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to have a billet at Coxon &amp; Wood-
house&#8217;s, of Draper&#8217;s Gardens, but they were let in
early in the spring through the Venezuelan loan, as
no doubt you remember, and came a nasty crop-
per. I had been with them five years, and old
Coxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when
</p>
<p>the smash came, but of course we clerks were all
turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. I tried here
and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps
on the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost
for a long time. I had been taking three pounds a
week at Coxon&#8217;s, and I had saved about seventy
of them, but I soon worked my way through that
and out at the other end. I was fairly at the end of
my tether at last, and could hardly find the stamps
to answer the advertisements or the envelopes to
stick them to. I had worn out my boots paddling
up office stairs, and I seemed just as far from get-
ting a billet as ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last I saw a vacancy at Mawson &amp;
Williams&#8217;s, the great stock-broking firm in Lom-
bard Street. I dare say E. C. is not much in your
line, but I can tell you that this is about the richest
house in London. The advertisement was to be an-
swered by letter only. I sent in my testimonial and
application, but without the least hope of getting
it. Back came an answer by return, saying that if I
would appear next Monday I might take over my
new duties at once, provided that my appearance
was satisfactory. No one knows how these things
are worked. Some people say that the manager
just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the
first that comes. Anyhow it was my innings that
time, and I don&#8217;t ever wish to feel better pleased.
The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties
just about the same as at Coxon&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I come to the queer part of the busi-
ness. I was in diggings out Hampstead way, 17
Potter&#8217;s Terrace. Well, I was sitting doing a smoke
that very evening after I had been promised the
appointment, when up came my landlady with a
card which had &#8220;Arthur Pinner, Financial Agent,&#8221;
printed upon it. I had never heard the name before
and could not imagine what he wanted with me;
but, of course, I asked her to show him up. In he
walked, a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed,
black-bearded man, with a touch of the sheeny
about his nose. He had a brisk kind of way with
him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the
value of time.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?&#8217; said he.
&#8220; &#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; I answered, pushing a chair towards
</p>
<p>him.
&#8220; &#8216;Lately engaged at Coxon &amp; Woodhouse&#8217;s?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;And now on the staff of Mawson&#8217;s.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Quite so.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;the fact is that I have heard
</p>
<p>some really extraordinary stories about your finan-
cial ability. You remember Parker, who used to be
</p>
<p>308</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Coxon&#8217;s manager? He can never say enough about
it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I was pleased to hear this. I had
always been pretty sharp in the office, but I had
never dreamed that I was talked about in the City
in this fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have a good memory?&#8217; said he.
&#8220; &#8216;Pretty fair,&#8217; I answered, modestly.
&#8220; &#8216;Have you kept in touch with the market
</p>
<p>while you have been out of work?&#8217; he asked.
&#8220; &#8216;Yes. I read the stock exchange list every
</p>
<p>morning.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Now that shows real application!&#8217; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8216;That is the way to prosper! You won&#8217;t mind my
testing you, will you? Let me see. How are Ayr-
shires?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;A hundred and six and a quarter to a hun-
dred and five and seven-eighths.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And New Zealand consolidated?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;A hundred and four.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;And British Broken Hills?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Seven to seven-and-six.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Wonderful!&#8217; he cried, with his hands up.
</p>
<p>&#8216;This quite fits in with all that I had heard. My
boy, my boy, you are very much too good to be a
clerk at Mawson&#8217;s!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This outburst rather astonished me, as you
can think. &#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, &#8216;other people don&#8217;t think
quite so much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner.
I had a hard enough fight to get this berth, and I
am very glad to have it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Pooh, man; you should soar above it. You
are not in your true sphere. Now, I&#8217;ll tell you how
it stands with me. What I have to offer is little
enough when measured by your ability, but when
compared with Mawson&#8217;s, it&#8217;s light to dark. Let
me see. When do you go to Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;On Monday.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Ha, ha! I think I would risk a little sporting
</p>
<p>flutter that you don&#8217;t go there at all.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Not go to Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;No, sir. By that day you will be the busi-
</p>
<p>ness manager of the Franco-Midland Hardware
Company, Limited, with a hundred and thirty-four
branches in the towns and villages of France, not
counting one in Brussels and one in San Remo.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This took my breath away. &#8216;I never heard of
it,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Very likely not. It has been kept very quiet,
for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it&#8217;s
</p>
<p>too good a thing to let the public into. My brother,
Harry Pinner, is promoter, and joins the board af-
ter allotment as managing director. He knew I was
in the swim down here, and asked me to pick up
a good man cheap. A young, pushing man with
plenty of snap about him. Parker spoke of you,
and that brought me here tonight. We can only
offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Five hundred a year!&#8217; I shouted.
&#8220; &#8216;Only that at the beginning; but you are to
</p>
<p>have an overriding commission of one per cent on
all business done by your agents, and you may
take my word for it that this will come to more
than your salary.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But I know nothing about hardware.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Tut, my boy; you know about figures.&#8217;
&#8220;My head buzzed, and I could hardly sit still in
</p>
<p>my chair. But suddenly a little chill of doubt came
upon me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I must be frank with you,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Mawson
only gives me two hundred, but Mawson is safe.
Now, really, I know so little about your company
that&#8212;&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, smart, smart!&#8217; he cried, in a kind of ec-
stasy of delight. &#8216;You are the very man for us. You
are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. Now,
here&#8217;s a note for a hundred pounds, and if you
think that we can do business you may just slip it
into your pocket as an advance upon your salary.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That is very handsome,&#8217; said I. &#8216;When should
I take over my new duties?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Be in Birmingham to-morrow at one,&#8217; said
he. &#8216;I have a note in my pocket here which you
will take to my brother. You will find him at 126b
Corporation Street, where the temporary offices of
the company are situated. Of course he must con-
firm your engagement, but between ourselves it
will be all right.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Really, I hardly know how to express my
gratitude, Mr. Pinner,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Not at all, my boy. You have only got your
desserts. There are one or two small things&#8212;mere
formalities&#8212;which I must arrange with you. You
have a bit of paper beside you there. Kindly write
upon it &#8220;I am perfectly willing to act as business
manager to the Franco-Midland Hardware Com-
pany, Limited, at a minimum salary of &#163;500.&#8221; &#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did as he asked, and he put the paper in his
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There is one other detail,&#8217; said he. &#8216;What do
you intend to do about Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten all about Mawson&#8217;s in my joy.
&#8216;I&#8217;ll write and resign,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>309</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stock-Broker&#8217;s Clerk
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Precisely what I don&#8217;t want you to do. I had
a row over you with Mawson&#8217;s manager. I had
gone up to ask him about you, and he was very
offensive; accused me of coaxing you away from
the service of the firm, and that sort of thing. At
last I fairly lost my temper. &#8220;If you want good men
you should pay them a good price,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;He would rather have our small price than
your big one,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you a fiver,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that when he
has my offer you&#8217;ll never so much as hear from
him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Done!&#8221; said he. &#8220;We picked him out of the
gutter, and he won&#8217;t leave us so easily.&#8221; Those were
his very words.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The impudent scoundrel!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;I&#8217;ve never
so much as seen him in my life. Why should I con-
sider him in any way? I shall certainly not write if
you would rather I didn&#8217;t.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Good! That&#8217;s a promise,&#8217; said he, rising from
his chair. &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have got so good
a man for my brother. Here&#8217;s your advance of a
hundred pounds, and here is the letter. Make a
note of the address, 126b Corporation Street, and
remember that one o&#8217;clock to-morrow is your ap-
pointment. Good-night; and may you have all the
fortune that you deserve!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about all that passed between us,
as near as I can remember. You can imagine, Dr.
Watson, how pleased I was at such an extraordi-
nary bit of good fortune. I sat up half the night
hugging myself over it, and next day I was off
to Birmingham in a train that would take me in
plenty time for my appointment. I took my things
to a hotel in New Street, and then I made my way
to the address which had been given me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a quarter of an hour before my time, but
I thought that would make no difference. 126b was
a passage between two large shops, which led to a
winding stone stair, from which there were many
flats, let as offices to companies or professional
men. The names of the occupants were painted
at the bottom on the wall, but there was no such
name as the Franco-Midland Hardware Company,
Limited. I stood for a few minutes with my heart
in my boots, wondering whether the whole thing
was an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man
and addressed me. He was very like the chap I had
seen the night before, the same figure and voice,
but he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Are you Mr. Hall Pycroft?&#8217; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Oh! I was expecting you, but you are a trifle
before your time. I had a note from my brother
this morning in which he sang your praises very
loudly.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I was just looking for the offices when you
came.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;We have not got our name up yet, for we
only secured these temporary premises last week.
Come up with me, and we will talk the matter
over.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed him to the top of a very lofty stair,
and there, right under the slates, were a couple of
empty, dusty little rooms, uncarpeted and uncur-
tained, into which he led me. I had thought of a
great office with shining tables and rows of clerks,
such as I was used to, and I dare say I stared rather
straight at the two deal chairs and one little table,
which, with a ledger and a waste paper basket,
made up the whole furniture.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Don&#8217;t be disheartened, Mr. Pycroft,&#8217; said my
new acquaintance, seeing the length of my face.
&#8216;Rome was not built in a day, and we have lots of
money at our backs, though we don&#8217;t cut much
dash yet in offices. Pray sit down, and let me have
your letter.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it to him, and her read it over very care-
fully.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You seem to have made a vast impression
upon my brother Arthur,&#8217; said he; &#8216;and I know
that he is a pretty shrewd judge. Hew swears by
London, you know; and I by Birmingham; but this
time I shall follow his advice. Pray consider your-
self definitely engaged.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What are my duties?&#8217; I asked.
&#8220; &#8216;You will eventually manage the great depot
</p>
<p>in Paris, which will pour a flood of English crock-
ery into the shops of a hundred and thirty-four
agents in France. The purchase will be completed
in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in
Birmingham and make yourself useful.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How?&#8217;
&#8220;For answer, he took a big red book out of a
</p>
<p>drawer.
&#8220; &#8216;This is a directory of Paris,&#8217; said he, &#8216;with the
</p>
<p>trades after the names of the people. I want you
to take it home with you, and to mark off all the
hardware sellers, with their addresses. It would be
of the greatest use to me to have them.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Surely there are classified lists?&#8217; I suggested.
&#8220; &#8216;Not reliable ones. Their system is different
</p>
<p>from ours. Stick at it, and let me have the lists by
Monday, at twelve. Good-day, Mr. Pycroft. If you
continue to show zeal and intelligence you will
find the company a good master.&#8217;

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I went back to the hotel with the big book un-
der my arm, and with very conflicting feelings in
my breast. On the one hand, I was definitely en-
gaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket;
on the other, the look of the offices, the absence
of name on the wall, and other of the points which
would strike a business man had left a bad impres-
sion as to the position of my employers. However,
come what might, I had my money, so I settled
down to my task. All Sunday I was kept hard at
work, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as
H. I went round to my employer, found him in the
same dismantled kind of room, and was told to
keep at it until Wednesday, and then come again.
On Wednesday it was still unfinished, so I ham-
mered away until Friday&#8212;that is, yesterday. Then
I brought it round to Mr. Harry Pinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Thank you very much,&#8217; said he; &#8216;I fear that I
underrated the difficulty of the task. This list will
be of very material assistance to me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It took some time,&#8217; said I.
&#8220; &#8216;And now,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I want you to make a list
</p>
<p>of the furniture shops, for they all sell crockery.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Very good.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;And you can come up to-morrow evening,
</p>
<p>at seven, and let me know how you are getting
on. Don&#8217;t overwork yourself. A couple of hours at
Day&#8217;s Music Hall in the evening would do you no
harm after your labors.&#8217; He laughed as he spoke,
and I saw with a thrill that his second tooth upon
the left-hand side had been very badly stuffed with
gold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with de-
light, and I stared with astonishment at our client.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may well look surprised, Dr. Watson; but
it is this way,&#8221; said he: &#8220;When I was speaking
to the other chap in London, at the time that he
laughed at my not going to Mawson&#8217;s, I happened
to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very
identical fashion. The glint of the gold in each
case caught my eye, you see. When I put that
with the voice and figure being the same, and only
those things altered which might be changed by a
razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the
same man. Of course you expect two brothers to
be alike, but not that they should have the same
tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out,
and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing
whether I was on my head or my heels. Back I
went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold
water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent
me from London to Birmingham? Why had he got
there before me? And why had he written a let-
ter from himself to himself? It was altogether too
</p>
<p>much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And
then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to
me might be very light to Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I
had just time to get up to town by the night train to
see him this morning, and to bring you both back
with me to Birmingham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause after the stock-broker&#8217;s clerk
had concluded his surprising experience. Then
Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me, leaning
back on the cushions with a pleased and yet criti-
cal face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his
first sip of a comet vintage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather fine, Watson, is it not?&#8221; said he. &#8220;There
are points in it which please me. I think that
you will agree with me that an interview with Mr.
Arthur Harry Pinner in the temporary offices of
the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited,
would be a rather interesting experience for both
of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can we do it?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, easily enough,&#8221; said Hall Pycroft, cheer-
ily. &#8220;You are two friends of mine who are in want
of a billet, and what could be more natural than
that I should bring you both round to the manag-
ing director?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so, of course,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I should
like to have a look at the gentleman, and see if I
can make anything of his little game. What quali-
ties have you, my friend, which would make your
services so valuable? Or is it possible that&#8212;&#8221; He
began biting his nails and staring blankly out of
the window, and we hardly drew another word
from him until we were in New Street.
</p>
<p>At seven o&#8217;clock that evening we were walk-
ing, the three of us, down Corporation Street to
the company&#8217;s offices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no use our being at all before our time,&#8221;
said our client. &#8220;He only comes there to see me,
apparently, for the place is deserted up to the very
hour he names.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is suggestive,&#8221; remarked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, I told you so!&#8221; cried the clerk. &#8220;That&#8217;s
he walking ahead of us there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed
man who was bustling along the other side of the
road. As we watched him he looked across at a
boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the
evening paper, and running over among the cabs
and busses, he bought one from him. Then, clutch-
ing it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried Hall Pycroft. &#8220;These
are the company&#8217;s offices into which he has gone.
</p>
<p>311</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stock-Broker&#8217;s Clerk
</p>
<p>Come with me, and I&#8217;ll fix it up as easily as possi-
ble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Following his lead, we ascended five stories,
until we found ourselves outside a half-opened
door, at which our client tapped. A voice within
bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished
room such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the
single table sat the man whom we had seen in
the street, with his evening paper spread out in
front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed
to me that I had never looked upon a face which
bore such marks of grief, and of something beyond
grief&#8212;of a horror such as comes to few men in a
lifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration, his
cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish&#8217;s belly,
and his eyes were wild and staring. He looked
at his clerk as though he failed to recognize him,
and I could see by the astonishment depicted upon
our conductor&#8217;s face that this was by no means the
usual appearance of his employer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look ill, Mr. Pinner!&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am not very well,&#8221; answered the other,
making obvious efforts to pull himself together,
and licking his dry lips before he spoke. &#8220;Who
are these gentlemen whom you have brought with
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and the
other is Mr. Price, of this town,&#8221; said our clerk,
glibly. &#8220;They are friends of mine and gentlemen of
experience, but they have been out of a place for
some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you
might find an opening for them in the company&#8217;s
employment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very possibly! Very possibly!&#8221; cried Mr. Pin-
ner with a ghastly smile. &#8220;Yes, I have no doubt that
we shall be able to do something for you. What is
your particular line, Mr. Harris?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an accountant,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes, we shall want something of the sort.
And you, Mr. Price?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clerk,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have every hope that the company may ac-
commodate you. I will let you know about it as
soon as we come to any conclusion. And now I
beg that you will go. For God&#8217;s sake leave me to
myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>These last words were shot out of him, as
though the constraint which he was evidently set-
ting upon himself had suddenly and utterly burst
asunder. Holmes and I glanced at each other, and
Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget, Mr. Pinner, that I am here by ap-
pointment to receive some directions from you,&#8221;
said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Pycroft, certainly,&#8221; the other re-
sumed in a calmer tone. &#8220;You may wait here a
moment; and there is no reason why your friends
should not wait with you. I will be entirely at your
service in three minutes, if I might trespass upon
your patience so far.&#8221; He rose with a very courte-
ous air, and, bowing to us, he passed out through
a door at the farther end of the room, which he
closed behind him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; whispered Holmes. &#8220;Is he giving
us the slip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; answered Pycroft.
&#8220;Why so?&#8221;
&#8220;That door leads into an inner room.&#8221;
&#8220;There is no exit?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Is it furnished?&#8221;
&#8220;It was empty yesterday.&#8221;
&#8220;Then what on earth can he be doing? There is
</p>
<p>something which I don&#8217;t understand in his man-
ner. If ever a man was three parts mad with terror,
that man&#8217;s name is Pinner. What can have put the
shivers on him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He suspects that we are detectives,&#8221; I sug-
gested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Pycroft.
Holmes shook his head. &#8220;He did not turn pale.
</p>
<p>He was pale when we entered the room,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;It is just possible that&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>His words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat
from the direction of the inner door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the deuce is he knocking at his own
door for?&#8221; cried the clerk.
</p>
<p>Again and much louder cam the rat-tat-tat. We
all gazed expectantly at the closed door. Glanc-
ing at Holmes, I saw his face turn rigid, and he
leaned forward in intense excitement. Then sud-
denly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a
brisk drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang
frantically across the room and pushed at the door.
It was fastened on the inner side. Following his
example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our
weight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and
down came the door with a crash. Rushing over
it, we found ourselves in the inner room. It was
empty.
</p>
<p>But it was only for a moment that we were
at fault. At one corner, the corner nearest the
</p>
<p>312</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>room which we had left, there was a second door.
Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat
and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from
a hook behind the door, with his own braces
round his neck, was hanging the managing di-
rector of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company.
His knees were drawn up, his head hung at a
dreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his
heels against the door made the noise which had
broken in upon our conversation. In an instant I
had caught him round the waist, and held him up
while Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic bands
which had disappeared between the livid creases
of skin. Then we carried him into the other room,
where he lay with a clay-colored face, puffing his
purple lips in and out with every breath&#8212;a dread-
ful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, Watson?&#8221; asked
Holmes.
</p>
<p>I stooped over him and examined him. His
pulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breath-
ing grew longer, and there was a little shivering of
his eyelids, which showed a thin white slit of ball
beneath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been touch and go with him,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;but he&#8217;ll live now. Just open that window, and
hand me the water carafe.&#8221; I undid his collar,
poured the cold water over his face, and raised
and sank his arms until he drew a long, natural
breath. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a question of time now,&#8221; said I,
as I turned away from him.
</p>
<p>Holmes stood by the table, with his hands deep
in his trouser&#8217;s pockets and his chin upon his
breast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we ought to call the police in now,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And yet I confess that I&#8217;d like to give
them a complete case when they come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blessed mystery to me,&#8221; cried Pycroft,
scratching his head. &#8220;Whatever they wanted to
bring me all the way up here for, and then&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! All that is clear enough,&#8221; said Holmes
impatiently. &#8220;It is this last sudden move.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand the rest, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it is fairly obvious. What do you
say, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;I must confess that
I am out of my depths,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh surely if you consider the events at first
they can only point to one conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the whole thing hinges upon two points.
The first is the making of Pycroft write a declara-
tion by which he entered the service of this pre-
posterous company. Do you not see how very sug-
gestive that is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I miss the point.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, why did they want him to do it? Not
</p>
<p>as a business matter, for these arrangements are
usually verbal, and there was no earthly business
reason why this should be an exception. Don&#8217;t you
see, my young friend, that they were very anxious
to obtain a specimen of your handwriting, and had
no other way of doing it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;
&#8220;Quite so. Why? When we answer that we
</p>
<p>have made some progress with our little problem.
Why? There can be only one adequate reason.
Someone wanted to learn to imitate your writing,
and had to procure a specimen of it first. And now
if we pass on to the second point we find that each
throws light upon the other. That point is the re-
quest made by Pinner that you should not resign
your place, but should leave the manager of this
important business in the full expectation that a
Mr. Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was
about to enter the office upon the Monday morn-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; cried our client, &#8220;what a blind bee-
tle I have been!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you see the point about the handwrit-
ing. Suppose that some one turned up in your
place who wrote a completely different hand from
that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of
course the game would have been up. But in the
interval the rogue had learned to imitate you, and
his position was therefore secure, as I presume that
nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul,&#8221; groaned Hall Pycroft.
&#8220;Very good. Of course it was of the utmost
</p>
<p>importance to prevent you from thinking better of
it, and also to keep you from coming into contact
with any one who might tell you that your double
was at work in Mawson&#8217;s office. Therefore they
gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and
ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you
enough work to do to prevent your going to Lon-
don, where you might have burst their little game
up. That is all plain enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should this man pretend to be his
own brother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is pretty clear also. There are ev-
idently only two of them in it. The other is im-
personating you at the office. This one acted as
</p>
<p>313</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stock-Broker&#8217;s Clerk
</p>
<p>your engager, and then found that he could not
find you an employer without admitting a third
person into his plot. That he was most unwill-
ing to do. He changed his appearance as far as
he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you
could not fail to observe, would be put down to a
family resemblance. But for the happy chance of
the gold stuffing, your suspicions would probably
never have been aroused.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hall Pycroft shook his clinched hands in the
air. &#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;while I have been
fooled in this way, what has this other Hall Pycroft
been doing at Mawson&#8217;s? What should we do, Mr.
Holmes? Tell me what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must wire to Mawson&#8217;s.&#8221;
&#8220;They shut at twelve on Saturdays.&#8221;
&#8220;Never mind. There may be some door-keeper
</p>
<p>or attendant&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Ah yes, they keep a permanent guard there
</p>
<p>on account of the value of the securities that they
hold. I remember hearing it talked of in the City.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good; we shall wire to him, and see if
all is well, and if a clerk of your name is work-
ing there. That is clear enough; but what is not so
clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues should
instantly walk out of the room and hang himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The paper!&#8221; croaked a voice behind us. The
man was sitting up, blanched and ghastly, with
returning reason in his eyes, and hands which
rubbed nervously at the broad red band which still
encircled his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The paper! Of course!&#8221; yelled Holmes, in
a paroxysm of excitement. &#8220;Idiot that I was! I
thought so must of our visit that the paper never
entered my head for an instant. To be sure, the se-
cret must be there.&#8221; He flattened it out upon the
table, and a cry of triumph burst from his lips.
&#8220;Look at this, Watson,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is a Lon-
don paper, an early edition of the Evening Stan-
dard. Here is what we want. Look at the head-
lines: &#8216;Crime in the City. Murder at Mawson &amp;
Williams&#8217;s. Gigantic attempted Robbery. Capture
of the Criminal.&#8217; Here, Watson, we are all equally
anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It appeared from its position in the paper to
have been the one event of importance in town,
and the account of it ran in this way:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A desperate attempt at robbery, culminat-
ing in the death of one man and the cap-
ture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon
in the City. For some time back Mawson
&amp; Williams, the famous financial ho
