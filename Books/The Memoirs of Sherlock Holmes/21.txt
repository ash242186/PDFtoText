<p>uring my long and intimate acquain-
tance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had
never heard him refer to his relations,
and hardly ever to his own early life.
</p>
<p>This reticence upon his part had increased the
somewhat inhuman effect which he produced
upon me, until sometimes I found myself regard-
ing him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain with-
out a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he
was pre-eminent in intelligence. His aversion to
women and his disinclination to form new friend-
ships were both typical of his unemotional charac-
ter, but not more so than his complete suppression
of every reference to his own people. I had come
to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives
living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he
began to talk to me about his brother.
</p>
<p>It was after tea on a summer evening, and the
conversation, which had roamed in a desultory,
spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes
of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came
round at last to the question of atavism and hered-
itary aptitudes. The point under discussion was,
how far any singular gift in an individual was due
to his ancestry and how far to his own early train-
ing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In your own case,&#8221; said I, &#8220;from all that you
have told me, it seems obvious that your faculty of
observation and your peculiar facility for deduc-
tion are due to your own systematic training.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To some extent,&#8221; he answered, thoughtfully.
&#8220;My ancestors were country squires, who appear
to have led much the same life as is natural to their
class. But, none the less, my turn that way is in my
veins, and may have come with my grandmother,
who was the sister of Vernet, the French artist. Art
in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you know that it is hereditary?&#8221;
&#8220;Because my brother Mycroft possesses it in a
</p>
<p>larger degree than I do.&#8221;
This was news to me indeed. If there were
</p>
<p>another man with such singular powers in Eng-
land, how was it that neither police nor public had
heard of him? I put the question, with a hint that
it was my companion&#8217;s modesty which made him
acknowledge his brother as his superior. Holmes
laughed at my suggestion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I cannot agree
with those who rank modesty among the virtues.
To the logician all things should be seen exactly
as they are, and to underestimate one&#8217;s self is
as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate
one&#8217;s own powers. When I say, therefore, that My-
croft has better powers of observation than I, you
</p>
<p>may take it that I am speaking the exact and literal
truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he your junior?&#8221;
&#8220;Seven years my senior.&#8221;
&#8220;How comes it that he is unknown?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, he is very well known in his own circle.&#8221;
&#8220;Where, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, in the Diogenes Club, for example.&#8221;
I had never heard of the institution, and my
</p>
<p>face must have proclaimed as much, for Sherlock
Holmes pulled out his watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Diogenes Club is the queerest club in
London, and Mycroft one of the queerest men.
He&#8217;s always there from quarter to five to twenty
to eight. It&#8217;s six now, so if you care for a stroll this
beautiful evening I shall be very happy to intro-
duce you to two curiosities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five minutes later we were in the street, walk-
ing towards Regent&#8217;s Circus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder,&#8221; said my companion, &#8220;why it is
that Mycroft does not use his powers for detective
work. He is incapable of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought you said&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;I said that he was my superior in observation
</p>
<p>and deduction. If the art of the detective began
and ended in reasoning from an arm-chair, my
brother would be the greatest criminal agent that
ever lived. But he has no ambition and no en-
ergy. He will not even go out of his way to verify
his own solution, and would rather be considered
wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right.
Again and again I have taken a problem to him,
and have received an explanation which has after-
wards proved to be the correct one. And yet he
was absolutely incapable of working out the prac-
tical points which must be gone into before a case
could be laid before a judge or jury.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not his profession, then?&#8221;
&#8220;By no means. What is to me a means of liveli-
</p>
<p>hood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante. He
has an extraordinary faculty for figures, and audits
the books in some of the government departments.
Mycroft lodges in Pall Mall, and he walks round
the corner into Whitehall every morning and back
every evening. From year&#8217;s end to year&#8217;s end he
takes no other exercise, and is seen nowhere else,
except only in the Diogenes Club, which is just op-
posite his rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot recall the name.&#8221;
&#8220;Very likely not. There are many men in Lon-
</p>
<p>don, you know, who, some from shyness, some
from misanthropy, have no wish for the company
</p>
<p>377</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Greek Interpreter
</p>
<p>of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to com-
fortable chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for
the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club
was started, and it now contains the most unsocia-
ble and unclubable men in town. No member is
permitted to take the least notice of any other one.
Save in the Stranger&#8217;s Room, no talking is, under
any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if
brought to the notice of the committee, render the
talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of
the founders, and I have myself found it a very
soothing atmosphere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had reached Pall Mall as we talked, and
were walking down it from the St. James&#8217;s end.
Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little dis-
tance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not
to speak, he led the way into the hall. Through
the glass paneling I caught a glimpse of a large
and luxurious room, in which a considerable num-
ber of men were sitting about and reading papers,
each in his own little nook. Holmes showed me
into a small chamber which looked out into Pall
Mall, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came
back with a companion whom I knew could only
be his brother.
</p>
<p>Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter
man than Sherlock. His body was absolutely cor-
pulent, but his face, though massive, had pre-
served something of the sharpness of expression
which was so remarkable in that of his brother. His
eyes, which were of a peculiarly light, watery gray,
seemed to always retain that far-away, introspec-
tive look which I had only observed in Sherlock&#8217;s
when he was exerting his full powers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said he, putting
out a broad, fat hand like the flipper of a seal.
&#8220;I hear of Sherlock everywhere since you became
his chronicler. By the way, Sherlock, I expected to
see you round last week, to consult me over that
Manor House case. I thought you might be a little
out of your depth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I solved it,&#8221; said my friend, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Adams, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was Adams.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure of it from the first.&#8221; The two sat
down together in the bow-window of the club.
&#8220;To any one who wishes to study mankind this is
the spot,&#8221; said Mycroft. &#8220;Look at the magnificent
types! Look at these two men who are coming to-
wards us, for example.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The billiard-marker and the other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. What do you make of the other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two men had stopped opposite the win-
dow. Some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket
were the only signs of billiards which I could see
in one of them. The other was a very small, dark
fellow, with his hat pushed back and several pack-
ages under his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An old soldier, I perceive,&#8221; said Sherlock.
&#8220;And very recently discharged,&#8221; remarked the
</p>
<p>brother.
&#8220;Served in India, I see.&#8221;
&#8220;And a non-commissioned officer.&#8221;
&#8220;Royal Artillery, I fancy,&#8221; said Sherlock.
&#8220;And a widower.&#8221;
&#8220;But with a child.&#8221;
&#8220;Children, my dear boy, children.&#8221;
&#8220;Come,&#8221; said I, laughing, &#8220;this is a little too
</p>
<p>much.&#8221;
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; answered Holmes, &#8220;it is not hard to
</p>
<p>say that a man with that bearing, expression of au-
thority, and sunbaked skin, is a soldier, is more
than a private, and is not long from India.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he has not left the service long is shown
by his still wearing is ammunition boots, as they
are called,&#8221; observed Mycroft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had not the cavalry stride, yet he wore his
hat on one side, as is shown by the lighter skin
of that side of his brow. His weight is against his
being a sapper. He is in the artillery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, of course, his complete mourning
shows that he has lost some one very dear. The
fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as
though it were his wife. He has been buying things
for children, you perceive. There is a rattle, which
shows that one of them is very young. The wife
probably died in childbed. The fact that he has
a picture-book under his arm shows that there is
another child to be thought of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I began to understand what my friend meant
when he said that his brother possessed even
keener faculties that he did himself. He glanced
across at me and smiled. Mycroft took snuff from
a tortoise-shell box, and brushed away the wan-
dering grains from his coat front with a large, red
silk handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Sherlock,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have had
something quite after your own heart&#8212;a most sin-
gular problem&#8212;submitted to my judgment. I re-
ally had not the energy to follow it up save in a
very incomplete fashion, but it gave me a basis for
some pleasing speculation. If you would care to
hear the facts&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>378</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his
pocket-book, and, ringing the bell, he handed it to
the waiter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have asked Mr. Melas to step across,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;He lodges on the floor above me, and I have
some slight acquaintance with him, which led him
to come to me in his perplexity. Mr. Melas is a
Greek by extraction, as I understand, and he is a
remarkable linguist. He earns his living partly as
interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting
as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit
the Northumberland Avenue hotels. I think I will
leave him to tell his very remarkable experience in
his own fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later we were joined by a short,
stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair
proclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech
was that of an educated Englishman. He shook
hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark
eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood
that the specialist was anxious to hear his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that the police credit me&#8212;on
my word, I do not,&#8221; said he in a wailing voice.
&#8220;Just because they have never heard of it before,
they think that such a thing cannot be. But I
know that I shall never be easy in my mind un-
til I know what has become of my poor man with
the sticking-plaster upon his face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all attention,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes.
&#8220;This is Wednesday evening,&#8221; said Mr. Melas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, it was Monday night&#8212;only two days
ago, you understand&#8212;that all this happened. I
am an interpreter, as perhaps my neighbor there
has told you. I interpret all languages&#8212;or nearly
all&#8212;but as I am a Greek by birth and with a Gre-
cian name, it is with that particular tongue that I
am principally associated. For many years I have
been the chief Greek interpreter in London, and
my name is very well known in the hotels.
</p>
<p>It happens not unfrequently that I am sent for
at strange hours by foreigners who get into diffi-
culties, or by travelers who arrive late and wish my
services. I was not surprised, therefore, on Mon-
day night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably
dressed young man, came up to my rooms and
asked me to accompany him in a cab which was
waiting at the door. A Greek friend had come to
see him upon business, he said, and as he could
speak nothing but his own tongue, the services of
an interpreter were indispensable. He gave me to
understand that his house was some little distance
off, in Kensington, and he seemed to be in a great
hurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we
had descended to the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say into the cab, but I soon became doubtful
as to whether it was not a carriage in which I found
myself. It was certainly more roomy than the ordi-
nary four-wheeled disgrace to London, and the fit-
tings, though frayed, were of rich quality. Mr. La-
timer seated himself opposite to me and we started
off through Charing Cross and up the Shaftesbury
Avenue. We had come out upon Oxford Street and
I had ventured some remark as to this being a
roundabout way to Kensington, when my words
were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He began by drawing a most formidable-
looking bludgeon loaded with lead from his
pocket, and switching it backward and forward
several times, as if to test its weight and strength.
Then he placed it without a word upon the seat
beside him. Having done this, he drew up the
windows on each side, and I found to my aston-
ishment that they were covered with paper so as
to prevent my seeing through them.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I am sorry to cut off your view, Mr. Melas,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;The fact is that I have no intention that
you should see what the place is to which we are
driving. It might possibly be inconvenient to me if
you could find your way there again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can imagine, I was utterly taken aback
by such an address. My companion was a pow-
erful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart
from the weapon, I should not have had the slight-
est chance in a struggle with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. La-
timer,&#8217; I stammered. &#8216;You must be aware that what
you are doing is quite illegal.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;but we&#8217;ll make it up to you. I must warn you,
however, Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you
attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is
against my interests, you will find it a very serious
thing. I beg you to remember that no one knows
where you are, and that, whether you are in this
carriage or in my house, you are equally in my
power.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His words were quiet, but he had a rasping
way of saying them which was very menacing. I
sat in silence wondering what on earth could be
his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary
fashion. Whatever it might be, it was perfectly
clear that there was no possible use in my resist-
ing, and that I could only wait to see what might
befall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For nearly two hours we drove without my
having the least clue as to where we were going.
Sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved
</p>
<p>379</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Greek Interpreter
</p>
<p>causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course
suggested asphalt; but, save by this variation in
sound, there was nothing at all which could in the
remotest way help me to form a guess as to where
we were. The paper over each window was im-
penetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn
across the glass work in front. It was a quarter-
past seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch
showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when
we at last came to a standstill. My companion let
down the window, and I caught a glimpse of a
low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above
it. As I was hurried from the carriage it swung
open, and I found myself inside the house, with a
vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side
of me as I entered. Whether these were private
grounds, however, or bona-fide country was more
than I could possibly venture to say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a colored gas-lamp inside which
was turned so low that I could see little save that
the hall was of some size and hung with pictures.
In the dim light I could make out that the per-
son who had opened the door was a small, mean-
looking, middle-aged man with rounded shoul-
ders. As he turned towards us the glint of the light
showed me that he was wearing glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Is this Mr. Melas, Harold?&#8217; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well done, well done! No ill-will, Mr. Melas,
I hope, but we could not get on without you. If
you deal fair with us you&#8217;ll not regret it, but if you
try any tricks, God help you!&#8217; He spoke in a ner-
vous, jerky fashion, and with little giggling laughs
in between, but somehow he impressed me with
fear more than the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What do you want with me?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Only to ask a few questions of a Greek gen-
tleman who is visiting us, and to let us have the
answers. But say no more than you are told to say,
or&#8212;&#8217; here came the nervous giggle again&#8212;&#8216;you
had better never have been born.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As he spoke he opened a door and showed
the way into a room which appeared to be very
richly furnished, but again the only light was af-
forded by a single lamp half-turned down. The
chamber was certainly large, and the way in which
my feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it
told me of its richness. I caught glimpses of vel-
vet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and
what seemed to be a suit of Japanese armor at one
side of it. There was a chair just under the lamp,
and the elderly man motioned that I should sit
in it. The younger had left us, but he suddenly
</p>
<p>returned through another door, leading with him
a gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-
gown who moved slowly towards us. As he came
into the circle of dim light which enables me to see
him more clearly I was thrilled with horror at his
appearance. He was deadly pale and terribly ema-
ciated, with the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man
whose spirit was greater than his strength. But
what shocked me more than any signs of physical
weakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-
crossed with sticking-plaster, and that one large
pad of it was fastened over his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Have you the slate, Harold?&#8217; cried the older
man, as this strange being fell rather than sat down
into a chair. &#8216;Are his hands loose? Now, then, give
him the pencil. You are to ask the questions, Mr.
Melas, and he will write the answers. Ask him first
of all whether he is prepared to sign the papers?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s eyes flashed fire.
&#8220; &#8216;Never!&#8217; he wrote in Greek upon the slate.
&#8220; &#8216;On no condition?&#8217; I asked, at the bidding of
</p>
<p>our tyrant.
&#8220; &#8216;Only if I see her married in my presence by
</p>
<p>a Greek priest whom I know.&#8217;
&#8220;The man giggled in his venomous way.
&#8220; &#8216;You know what awaits you, then?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;I care nothing for myself.&#8217;
&#8220;These are samples of the questions and an-
</p>
<p>swers which made up our strange half-spoken,
half-written conversation. Again and again I had
to ask him whether he would give in and sign the
documents. Again and again I had the same in-
dignant reply. But soon a happy thought came to
me. I took to adding on little sentences of my
own to each question, innocent ones at first, to
test whether either of our companions knew any-
thing of the matter, and then, as I found that they
showed no signs I played a more dangerous game.
Our conversation ran something like this:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You can do no good by this obstinacy. Who
are you?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I care not. I am a stranger in London.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Your fate will be upon your own head. How
</p>
<p>long have you been here?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Let it be so. Three weeks.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;The property can never be yours. What ails
</p>
<p>you?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;It shall not go to villains. They are starving
</p>
<p>me.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;You shall go free if you sign. What house is
</p>
<p>this?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;I will never sign. I do not know.&#8217;
</p>
<p>380</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220; &#8216;You are not doing her any service. What is
your name?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Let me hear her say so. Kratides.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You shall see her if you sign. Where are you
from?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then I shall never see her. Athens.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes, and I
should have wormed out the whole story under
their very noses. My very next question might
have cleared the matter up, but at that instant the
door opened and a woman stepped into the room.
I could not see her clearly enough to know more
than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair,
and clad in some sort of loose white gown.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Harold,&#8217; said she, speaking English with a
broken accent. &#8216;I could not stay away longer. It is
so lonely up there with only&#8212;Oh, my God, it is
Paul!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These last words were in Greek, and at the
same instant the man with a convulsive effort tore
the plaster from his lips, and screaming out &#8216;So-
phy! Sophy!&#8217; rushed into the woman&#8217;s arms. Their
embrace was but for an instant, however, for the
younger man seized the woman and pushed her
out of the room, while the elder easily overpow-
ered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away
through the other door. For a moment I was left
alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with
some vague idea that I might in some way get
a clue to what this house was in which I found
myself. Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for
looking up I saw that the older man was standing
in the door-way with his eyes fixed upon me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That will do, Mr. Melas,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You
perceive that we have taken you into our confi-
dence over some very private business. We should
not have troubled you, only that our friend who
speaks Greek and who began these negotiations
has been forced to return to the East. It was quite
necessary for us to find some one to take his place,
and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There are five sovereigns here,&#8217; said he, walk-
ing up to me, &#8216;which will, I hope, be a sufficient
fee. But remember,&#8217; he added, tapping me lightly
on the chest and giggling, &#8216;if you speak to a human
soul about this&#8212;one human soul, mind&#8212;well,
may God have mercy upon your soul!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you the loathing and horror with
which this insignificant-looking man inspired me.
I could see him better now as the lamp-light shone
upon him. His features were peaky and sallow,
</p>
<p>and his little pointed beard was thready and ill-
nourished. He pushed his face forward as he
spoke and his lips and eyelids were continually
twitching like a man with St. Vitus&#8217;s dance. I
could not help thinking that his strange, catchy
little laugh was also a symptom of some nervous
malady. The terror of his face lay in his eyes, how-
ever, steel gray, and glistening coldly with a malig-
nant, inexorable cruelty in their depths.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;We shall know if you speak of this,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;We have our own means of information. Now you
will find the carriage waiting, and my friend will
see you on your way.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hurried through the hall and into the ve-
hicle, again obtaining that momentary glimpse of
trees and a garden. Mr. Latimer followed closely at
my heels, and took his place opposite to me with-
out a word. In silence we again drove for an inter-
minable distance with the windows raised, until at
last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled up.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You will get down here, Mr. Melas,&#8217; said my
companion. &#8216;I am sorry to leave you so far from
your house, but there is no alternative. Any at-
tempt upon your part to follow the carriage can
only end in injury to yourself.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He opened the door as he spoke, and I had
hardly time to spring out when the coachman
lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away. I
looked around me in astonishment. I was on some
sort of a heathy common mottled over with dark
clumps of furze-bushes. Far away stretched a line
of houses, with a light here and there in the upper
windows. On the other side I saw the red signal-
lamps of a railway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The carriage which had brought me was al-
ready out of sight. I stood gazing round and won-
dering where on earth I might be, when I saw
some one coming towards me in the darkness. As
he came up to me I made out that he was a railway
porter.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Can you tell me what place this is?&#8217; I asked.
&#8220; &#8216;Wandsworth Common,&#8217; said he.
&#8220; &#8216;Can I get a train into town?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;If you walk on a mile or so to Clapham Junc-
</p>
<p>tion,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you&#8217;ll just be in time for the last to
Victoria.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was the end of my adventure, Mr.
Holmes. I do not know where I was, nor whom
I spoke with, nor anything save what I have told
you. But I know that there is foul play going on,
and I want to help that unhappy man if I can. I
told the whole story to Mr. Mycroft Holmes next
morning, and subsequently to the police.&#8221;

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Greek Interpreter
</p>
<p>We all sat in silence for some little time after lis-
tening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sher-
lock looked across at his brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any steps?&#8221; he asked.
Mycroft picked up the Daily News, which was
</p>
<p>lying on the side-table.
&#8220;Anybody supplying any information as
to the whereabouts of a Greek gentleman
named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is
unable to speak English, will be rewarded.
A similar reward paid to any one giving
information about a Greek lady whose first
name is Sophy. X 2473.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was in all the dailies. No answer.&#8221;
&#8220;How about the Greek Legation?&#8221;
&#8220;I have inquired. They know nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;A wire to the head of the Athens police,
</p>
<p>then?&#8221;
&#8220;Sherlock has all the energy of the family,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>Mycroft, turning to me. &#8220;Well, you take the case
up by all means, and let me know if you do any
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered my friend, rising from
his chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know, and Mr. Melas also. In
the meantime, Mr. Melas, I should certainly be on
my guard, if I were you, for of course they must
know through these advertisements that you have
betrayed them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we walked home together, Holmes stopped
at a telegraph office and sent off several wires.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Watson,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;our evening
has been by no means wasted. Some of my most
interesting cases have come to me in this way
through Mycroft. The problem which we have just
listened to, although it can admit of but one expla-
nation, has still some distinguishing features.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have hopes of solving it?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, knowing as much as we do, it will be
</p>
<p>singular indeed if we fail to discover the rest. You
must yourself have formed some theory which will
explain the facts to which we have listened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a vague way, yes.&#8221;
&#8220;What was your idea, then?&#8221;
&#8220;It seemed to me to be obvious that this Greek
</p>
<p>girl had been carried off by the young Englishman
named Harold Latimer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Carried off from where?&#8221;
&#8220;Athens, perhaps.&#8221;
Sherlock Holmes shook his head. &#8220;This young
</p>
<p>man could not talk a word of Greek. The lady
could talk English fairly well. Inference&#8212;that she
</p>
<p>had been in England some little time, but he had
not been in Greece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, we will presume that she had come
on a visit to England, and that this Harold had per-
suaded her to fly with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is more probable.&#8221;
&#8220;Then the brother&#8212;for that, I fancy, must be
</p>
<p>the relationship&#8212;comes over from Greece to inter-
fere. He imprudently puts himself into the power
of the young man and his older associate. They
seize him and use violence towards him in or-
der to make him sign some papers to make over
the girl&#8217;s fortune&#8212;of which he may be trustee&#8212;to
them. This he refuses to do. In order to negotiate
with him they have to get an interpreter, and they
pitch upon this Mr. Melas, having used some other
one before. The girl is not told of the arrival of her
brother, and finds it out by the merest accident.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;I really
fancy that you are not far from the truth. You see
that we hold all the cards, and we have only to fear
some sudden act of violence on their part. If they
give us time we must have them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can we find where this house lies?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, if our conjecture is correct and the girl&#8217;s
</p>
<p>name is or was Sophy Kratides, we should have
no difficulty in tracing her. That must be our
main hope, for the brother is, of course, a com-
plete stranger. It is clear that some time has
elapsed since this Harold established these rela-
tions with the girl&#8212;some weeks, at any rate&#8212;since
the brother in Greece has had time to hear of it and
come across. If they have been living in the same
place during this time, it is probable that we shall
have some answer to Mycroft&#8217;s advertisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had reached our house in Baker Street
while we had been talking. Holmes ascended the
stair first, and as he opened the door of our room
he gave a start of surprise. Looking over his shoul-
der, I was equally astonished. His brother Mycroft
was sitting smoking in the arm-chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Sherlock! Come in, sir,&#8221; said he
blandly, smiling at our surprised faces. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
expect such energy from me, do you, Sherlock?
But somehow this case attracts me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221;
&#8220;I passed you in a hansom.&#8221;
&#8220;There has been some new development?&#8221;
&#8220;I had an answer to my advertisement.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, it came within a few minutes of your leav-
</p>
<p>ing.&#8221;
&#8220;And to what effect?&#8221;
</p>
<p>382</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Mycroft Holmes took out a sheet of paper.
&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;written with a J pen on
</p>
<p>royal cream paper by a middle-aged man with a
weak constitution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir [he says]:
&#8220;In answer to your advertisement of
</p>
<p>to-day&#8217;s date, I beg to inform you that I
know the young lady in question very
well. If you should care to call upon
me I could give you some particulars
as to her painful history. She is living
at present at The Myrtles, Beckenham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours faithfully,
&#8220;J. Davenport.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He writes from Lower Brixton,&#8221; said Mycroft
Holmes. &#8220;Do you not think that we might drive to
him now, Sherlock, and learn these particulars?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mycroft, the brother&#8217;s life is more
valuable than the sister&#8217;s story. I think we should
call at Scotland Yard for Inspector Gregson, and go
straight out to Beckenham. We know that a man is
being done to death, and every hour may be vital.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better pick up Mr. Melas on our way,&#8221; I sug-
gested. &#8220;We may need an interpreter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;Send the
boy for a four-wheeler, and we shall be off at
once.&#8221; He opened the table-drawer as he spoke,
and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his
pocket. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, in answer to my glance; &#8220;I
should say from what we have heard, that we are
dealing with a particularly dangerous gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was almost dark before we found ourselves
in Pall Mall, at the rooms of Mr. Melas. A gentle-
man had just called for him, and he was gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where?&#8221; asked Mycroft
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; answered the woman who
had opened the door; &#8220;I only know that he drove
away with the gentleman in a carriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the gentleman give a name?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a tall, handsome, dark young
</p>
<p>man?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, no, sir. He was a little gentleman, with
</p>
<p>glasses, thin in the face, but very pleasant in his
ways, for he was laughing al the time that he was
talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along!&#8221; cried Sherlock Holmes,
abruptly. &#8220;This grows serious,&#8221; he observed, as
we drove to Scotland Yard. &#8220;These men have got
hold of Melas again. He is a man of no physical
</p>
<p>courage, as they are well aware from their experi-
ence the other night. This villain was able to ter-
rorize him the instant that he got into his presence.
No doubt they want his professional services, but,
having used him, they may be inclined to punish
him for what they will regard as his treachery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our hope was that, by taking train, we might
get to Beckenham as soon or sooner than the car-
riage. On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it was
more than an hour before we could get Inspec-
tor Gregson and comply with the legal formali-
ties which would enable us to enter the house. It
was a quarter to ten before we reached London
Bridge, and half past before the four of us alighted
on the Beckenham platform. A drive of half a mile
brought us to The Myrtles&#8212;a large, dark house
standing back from the road in its own grounds.
Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up
the drive together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The windows are all dark,&#8221; remarked the in-
spector. &#8220;The house seems deserted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our birds are flown and the nest empty,&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say so?&#8221;
&#8220;A carriage heavily loaded with luggage has
</p>
<p>passed out during the last hour.&#8221;
The inspector laughed. &#8220;I saw the wheel-tracks
</p>
<p>in the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the
luggage come in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may have observed the same wheel-tracks
going the other way. But the outward-bound ones
were very much deeper&#8212;so much so that we can
say for a certainty that there was a very consider-
able weight on the carriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You get a trifle beyond me there,&#8221; said the in-
spector, shrugging his shoulder. &#8220;It will not be an
easy door to force, but we will try if we cannot
make some one hear us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled
at the bell, but without any success. Holmes had
slipped away, but he came back in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a window open,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;It is a mercy that you are on the side of the
</p>
<p>force, and not against it, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; remarked
the inspector, as he noted the clever way in which
my friend had forced back the catch. &#8220;Well, I think
that under the circumstances we may enter with-
out an invitation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One after the other we made our way into
a large apartment, which was evidently that in
which Mr. Melas had found himself. The inspec-
tor had lit his lantern, and by its light we could
see the two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the
</p>
<p>383</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Greek Interpreter
</p>
<p>suit of Japanese mail as he had described them. On
the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle,
and the remains of a meal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Holmes, suddenly.
</p>
<p>We all stood still and listened. A low moan-
ing sound was coming from somewhere over our
heads. Holmes rushed to the door and out into
the hall. The dismal noise came from upstairs. He
dashed up, the inspector and I at his heels, while
his brother Mycroft followed as quickly as his great
bulk would permit.
</p>
<p>Three doors faced up upon the second floor,
and it was from the central of these that the sinis-
ter sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a
dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine.
It was locked, but the key had been left on the out-
side. Holmes flung open the door and rushed in,
but he was out again in an instant, with his hand
to his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s charcoal,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Give it time. It will
clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peering in, we could see that the only light
in the room came from a dull blue flame which
flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre.
It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor,
while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague
loom of two figures which crouched against the
wall. From the open door there reeked a horri-
ble poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and
coughing. Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs
to draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into
the room, he threw up the window and hurled the
brazen tripod out into the garden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can enter in a minute,&#8221; he gasped, darting
out again. &#8220;Where is a candle? I doubt if we could
strike a match in that atmosphere. Hold the light
at the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft,
now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a rush we got to the poisoned men and
dragged them out into the well-lit hall. Both
of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with
swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. In-
deed, so distorted were their features that, save for
his black beard and stout figure, we might have
failed to recognize in one of them the Greek inter-
preter who had parted from us only a few hours
before at the Diogenes Club. His hands and feet
were securely strapped together, and he bore over
one eye the marks of a violent blow. The other,
who was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall
man in the last stage of emaciation, with several
strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque
pattern over his face. He had ceased to moan as we
</p>
<p>laid him down, and a glance showed me tha
