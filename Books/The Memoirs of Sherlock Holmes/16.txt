<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>have some papers here,&#8221; said my friend
Sherlock Holmes, as we sat one winter&#8217;s
night on either side of the fire, &#8220;which
I really think, Watson, that it would be
</p>
<p>worth your while to glance over. These are the
documents in the extraordinary case of the Gloria
Scott, and this is the message which struck Justice
of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had picked from a drawer a little tarnished
cylinder, and, undoing the tape, he handed me a
short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate gray-
paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The supply of game for London is going
steadily up,&#8221; it ran. &#8220;Head-keeper Hudson, we
believe, had been now told to receive all orders
for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-
pheasant&#8217;s life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As I glanced up from reading this enigmatical
message, I saw Holmes chuckling at the expression
upon my face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look a little bewildered,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot see how such a message as this
could inspire horror. It seems to me to be rather
grotesque than otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely. Yet the fact remains that the
reader, who was a fine, robust old man, was
knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt
end of a pistol.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You arouse my curiosity,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But why did
you say just now that there were very particular
reasons why I should study this case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it was the first in which I was ever
engaged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had often endeavored to elicit from my com-
panion what had first turned his mind in the di-
rection of criminal research, but had never caught
him before in a communicative humor. Now he
sat forward in this arm chair and spread out the
documents upon his knees. Then he lit his pipe
and sat for some time smoking and turning them
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never heard me talk of Victor Trevor?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;He was the only friend I made during the
two years I was at college. I was never a very socia-
ble fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping
in my rooms and working out my own little meth-
ods of thought, so that I never mixed much with
the men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had
few athletic tastes, and then my line of study was
quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that
we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the
</p>
<p>only man I knew, and that only through the acci-
dent of his bull terrier freezing on to my ankle one
morning as I went down to chapel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship,
but it was effective. I was laid by the heels for
ten days, but Trevor used to come in to inquire af-
ter me. At first it was only a minute&#8217;s chat, but
soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of
the term we were close friends. He was a hearty,
full-blooded fellow, full of spirits and energy, the
very opposite to me in most respects, but we had
some subjects in common, and it was a bond of
union when I found that he was as friendless as I.
Finally, he invited me down to his father&#8217;s place at
Donnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I accepted his hospi-
tality for a month of the long vacation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Trevor was evidently a man of some
wealth and consideration, a J.P., and a landed pro-
prietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the
north of Langmere, in the country of the Broads.
The house was and old-fashioned, wide-spread,
oak-beamed brick building, with a fine lime-lined
avenue leading up to it. There was excellent wild-
duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good fish-
ing, a small but select library, taken over, as I un-
derstood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable
cook, so that he would be a fastidious man who
could not put in a pleasant month there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend
his only son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There had been a daughter, I heard, but she
had died of diphtheria while on a visit to Birm-
ingham. The father interested me extremely. He
was a man of little culture, but with a consider-
able amount of rude strength, both physically and
mentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had
traveled far, had seen much of the world. And had
remembered all that he had learned. In person he
was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled
hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes
which were keen to the verge of fierceness. Yet
he had a reputation for kindness and charity on
the country-side, and was noted for the leniency
of his sentences from the bench.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One evening, shortly after my arrival, we were
sitting over a glass of port after dinner, when
young Trevor began to talk about those habits of
observation and inference which I had already
formed into a system, although I had not yet ap-
preciated the part which they were to play in my
life. The old man evidently thought that his son
was exaggerating in his description of one or two
trivial feats which I had performed.
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The &#8220;Gloria Scott&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Come, now, Mr. Holmes,&#8217; said he, laughing
good-humoredly. &#8216;I&#8217;m an excellent subject, if you
can deduce anything from me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I fear there is not very much,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;I
might suggest that you have gone about in fear of
some personal attack with the last twelvemonth.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The laugh faded from his lips, and he stared
at me in great surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, that&#8217;s true enough,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You know,
Victor,&#8217; turning to his son, &#8216;when we broke up that
poaching gang they swore to knife us, and Sir Ed-
ward Holly has actually been attacked. I&#8217;ve always
been on my guard since then, though I have no
idea how you know it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have a very handsome stick,&#8217; I answered.
&#8216;By the inscription I observed that you had not had
it more than a year. But you have taken some pains
to bore the head of it and pour melted lead into
the hole so as to make it a formidable weapon. I
argued that you would not take such precautions
unless you had some danger to fear.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Anything else?&#8217; he asked, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have boxed a good deal in your youth.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Right again. How did you know it? Is my
nose knocked a little out of the straight?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No,&#8217; said I. &#8216;It is your ears. They have the pe-
culiar flattening and thickening which marks the
boxing man.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Anything else?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have done a good deal of digging by
your callosities.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Made all my money at the gold fields.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have been in New Zealand.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Right again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You have visited Japan.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Quite true.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And you have been most intimately associ-
ated with some one whose initials were J. A., and
whom you afterwards were eager to entirely for-
get.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Trevor stood slowly up, fixed his large
blue eyes upon me with a strange wild stare, and
then pitched forward, with his face among the nut-
shells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine, Watson, how shocked both
his son and I were. His attack did not last long,
however, for when we undid his collar, and sprin-
kled the water from one of the finger-glasses over
his face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, boys,&#8217; said he, forcing a smile, &#8216;I hope I
haven&#8217;t frightened you. Strong as I look, there is a
weak place in my heart, and it does not take much
to knock me over. I don&#8217;t know how you manage
this, Mr. Holmes, but it seems to me that all the
detectives of fact and of fancy would be children
in your hands. That&#8217;s your line of life, sir, and you
may take the word of a man who has seen some-
thing of the world.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that recommendation, with the exagger-
ated estimate of my ability with which he pref-
aced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the
very first thing which ever made me feel that a
profession might be made out of what had up to
that time been the merest hobby. At the moment,
however, I was too much concerned at the sudden
illness of my host to think of anything else.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I hope that I have said nothing to pain you?&#8217;
said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, you certainly touched upon rather a
tender point. Might I ask how you know, and how
much you know?&#8217; He spoke now in a half-jesting
fashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back
of his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is simplicity itself,&#8217; said I. &#8216;When you bared
your arm to draw that fish into the boat I saw that
J. A. had been tattooed in the bend of the elbow.
The letters were still legible, but it was perfectly
clear from their blurred appearance, and from the
staining of the skin round them, that efforts had
been made to obliterate them. It was obvious, then,
that those initials had once been very familiar to
you, and that you had afterwards wished to forget
them.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What an eye you have!&#8217; he cried, with a sigh
of relief. &#8216;It is just as you say. But we won&#8217;t talk
of it. Of all ghosts the ghosts of our old lovers are
the worst. Come into the billiard-room and have a
quiet cigar.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From that day, amid all his cordiality, there
was always a touch of suspicion in Mr. Trevor&#8217;s
manner towards me. Even his son remarked it.
&#8216;You&#8217;ve given the governor such a turn,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;that he&#8217;ll never be sure again of what you know
and what you don&#8217;t know.&#8217; He did not mean to
show it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his
mind that it peeped out at every action. At last
I became so convinced that I was causing him un-
easiness that I drew my visit to a close. On the very
day, however, before I left, an incident occurred
which proved in the sequel to be of importance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were sitting out upon the lawn on garden
chairs, the three of us, basking in the sun and ad-
miring the view across the Broads, when a maid
</p>
<p>320</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>came out to say that there was a man at the door
who wanted to see Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What is his name?&#8217; asked my host.
&#8220; &#8216;He would not give any.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;What does he want, then?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;He says that you know him, and that he only
</p>
<p>wants a moment&#8217;s conversation.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Show him round here.&#8217; An instant after-
</p>
<p>wards there appeared a little wizened fellow with
a cringing manner and a shambling style of walk-
ing. He wore an open jacket, with a splotch of
tar on the sleeve, a red-and-black check shirt, dun-
garee trousers, and heavy boots badly worn. His
face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpet-
ual smile upon it, which showed an irregular line
of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half
closed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he
came slouching across the lawn I heard Mr. Trevor
make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and
jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. He
was back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek
of brandy as he passed me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, my man,&#8217; said he. &#8216;What can I do for
you?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sailor stood looking at him with puckered
eyes, and with the same loose-lipped smile upon
his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You don&#8217;t know me?&#8217; he asked.
&#8220; &#8216;Why, dear me, it is surely Hudson,&#8217; said Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor in a tone of surprise.
&#8220; &#8216;Hudson it is, sir,&#8217; said the seaman. &#8216;Why, it&#8217;s
</p>
<p>thirty year and more since I saw you last. Here
you are in your house, and me still picking my
salt meat out of the harness cask.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Tut, you will find that I have not forgotten
old times,&#8217; cried Mr. Trevor, and, walking towards
the sailor, he said something in a low voice. &#8216;Go
into the kitchen,&#8217; he continued out loud, &#8216;and you
will get food and drink. I have no doubt that I
shall find you a situation.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Thank you, sir,&#8217; said the seaman, touching
his fore-lock. &#8216;I&#8217;m just off a two-yearer in an eight-
knot tramp, short-handed at that, and I wants a
rest. I thought I&#8217;d get it either with Mr. Beddoes or
with you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah!&#8217; cried Trevor. &#8216;You know where Mr. Bed-
does is?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Bless you, sir, I know where all my old
friends are,&#8217; said the fellow with a sinister smile,
and he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen.
Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having
been shipmate with the man when he was going
</p>
<p>back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the
lawn, he went indoors. An hour later, when we
entered the house, we found him stretched dead
drunk upon the dining-room sofa. The whole in-
cident left a most ugly impression upon my mind,
and I was not sorry next day to leave Donnithorpe
behind me, for I felt that my presence must be a
source of embarrassment to my friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All this occurred during the first month of the
long vacation. I went up to my London rooms,
where I spent seven weeks working out a few ex-
periments in organic chemistry. One day, however,
when the autumn was far advanced and the vaca-
tion drawing to a close, I received a telegram from
my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe,
and saying that he was in great need of my advice
and assistance. Of course I dropped everything
and set out for the North once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He met me with the dog-cart at the station,
and I saw at a glance that the last two months had
been very trying ones for him. He had grown thin
and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery man-
ner for which he had been remarkable.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The governor is dying,&#8217; were the first words
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Impossible!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;What is the matter?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Apoplexy. Nervous shock, He&#8217;s been on the
verge all day. I doubt if we shall find him alive.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at
this unexpected news.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What has caused it?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, that is the point. Jump in and we can talk
it over while we drive. You remember that fellow
who came upon the evening before you left us?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Perfectly.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Do you know who it was that we let into the
house that day?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have no idea.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It was the devil, Holmes,&#8217; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I stared at him in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes, it was the devil himself. We have not
had a peaceful hour since&#8212;not one. The governor
has never held up his head from that evening, and
now the life has been crushed out of him and his
heart broken, all through this accursed Hudson.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What power had he, then?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ah, that is what I would give so much to
know. The kindly, charitable, good old gover-
nor&#8212;how could he have fallen into the clutches
of such a ruffian! But I am so glad that you have
come, Holmes. I trust very much to your judgment
</p>
<p>321</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The &#8220;Gloria Scott&#8221;
</p>
<p>and discretion, and I know that you will advise me
for the best.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were dashing along the smooth white
country road, with the long stretch of the Broads
in front of us glimmering in the red light of the
setting sun. From a grove upon our left I could
already see the high chimneys and the flag-staff
which marked the squire&#8217;s dwelling.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;My father made the fellow gardener,&#8217; said
my companion, &#8216;and then, as that did not satisfy
him, he was promoted to be butler. The house
seemed to be at his mercy, and he wandered about
and did what he chose in it. The maids com-
plained of his drunken habits and his vile lan-
guage. The dad raised their wages all round to
recompense them for the annoyance. The fellow
would take the boat and my father&#8217;s best gun and
treat himself to little shooting trips. And all this
with such a sneering, leering, insolent face that I
would have knocked him down twenty times over
if he had been a man of my own age. I tell you,
Holmes, I have had to keep a tight hold upon my-
self all this time; and now I am asking myself
whether, if I had let myself go a little more, I might
not have been a wiser man.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, matters went from bad to worse with
us, and this animal Hudson became more and
more intrusive, until at last, on making some in-
solent reply to my father in my presence one day,
I took him by the shoulders and turned him out of
the room. He slunk away with a livid face and two
venomous eyes which uttered more threats than
his tongue could do. I don&#8217;t know what passed
between the poor dad and him after that, but the
dad came to me next day and asked me whether
I would mind apologizing to Hudson. I refused,
as you can imagine, and asked my father how he
could allow such a wretch to take such liberties
with himself and his household.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Ah, my boy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is all very well to
talk, but you don&#8217;t know how I am placed. But
you shall know, Victor. I&#8217;ll see that you shall know,
come what may. You wouldn&#8217;t believe harm of
your poor old father, would you, lad?&#8221; He was
very much moved, and shut himself up in the
study all day, where I could see through the win-
dow that he was writing busily.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That evening there came what seemed to me
to be a grand release, for Hudson told us that he
was going to leave us. He walked into the dining-
room as we sat after dinner, and announced his
intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of Norfolk,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
run down to Mr. Beddoes in Hampshire. He&#8217;ll be
as glad to see me as you were, I dare say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;You&#8217;re not going away in any kind of spirit,
Hudson, I hope,&#8221; said my father, with a tameness
which mad my blood boil.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;ve not had my &#8217;pology,&#8221; said he sulkily,
glancing in my direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Victor, you will acknowledge that you have
used this worthy fellow rather roughly,&#8221; said the
dad, turning to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;On the contrary, I think that we have both
shown extraordinary patience towards him,&#8221; I an-
swered.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Oh, you do, do you?&#8221; he snarls. &#8220;Very
good, mate. We&#8217;ll see about that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;He slouched out of the room, and half an
hour afterwards left the house, leaving my father
in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night after night
I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he
was recovering his confidence that the blow did at
last fall.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And how?&#8217; I asked eagerly.
&#8220; &#8216;In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter
</p>
<p>arrived for my father yesterday evening, bearing
the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father read it,
clapped both his hands to his head, and began run-
ning round the room in little circles like a man who
has been driven out of his senses. When I at last
drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eye-
lids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that
he had a stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once.
We put him to bed; but the paralysis has spread,
he has shown no sign of returning consciousness,
and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You horrify me, Trevor!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;What then
could have been in this letter to cause so dreadful
a result?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of
it. The message was absurd and trivial. Ah, my
God, it is as I feared!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As he spoke we came round the curve of the
avenue, and saw in the fading light that every
blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
dashed up to the door, my friend&#8217;s face convulsed
with grief, a gentleman in black emerged from it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;When did it happen, doctor?&#8217; asked Trevor.
&#8220; &#8216;Almost immediately after you left.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Did he recover consciousness?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;For an instant before the end.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Any message for me?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Only that the papers were in the back drawer
</p>
<p>of the Japanese cabinet.&#8217;
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;My friend ascended with the doctor to the
chamber of death, while I remained in the study,
turning the whole matter over and over in my
head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in
my life. What was the past of this Trevor, pugilist,
traveler, and gold-digger, and how had he placed
himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?
Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the
half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright
when he had a letter from Fordingham? Then I
remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire,
and that this Mr. Beddoes, whom the seaman had
gone to visit and presumably to blackmail, had
also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the
seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty
secret which appeared to exist, or it might come
from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that
such a betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed
clear enough. But then how could this letter be
trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? He
must have misread it. If so, it must have been one
of those ingenious secret codes which mean one
thing while they seem to mean another. I must
see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For
an hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom, un-
til at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and
close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
composed, with these very papers which lie upon
my knee held in his grasp. He sat down opposite
to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and
handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon
a single sheet of gray paper. &#8216;The supply of game
for London is going steadily up,&#8217; it ran. &#8216;Head-
keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to
receive all orders for fly-paper and for preserva-
tion of your hen-pheasant&#8217;s life.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say my face looked as bewildered as
yours did just now when first I read this message.
Then I reread it very carefully. It was evidently
as I had thought, and some secret meaning must
lie buried in this strange combination of words.
Or could it be that there was a prearranged sig-
nificance to such phrases as &#8216;fly-paper&#8217; and &#8216;hen-
pheasant&#8217;? Such a meaning would be arbitrary and
could not be deduced in any way. And yet I was
loath to believe that this was the case, and the pres-
ence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
subject of the message was as I had guessed, and
that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I
tried it backwards, but the combination &#8216;life pheas-
ant&#8217;s hen&#8217; was not encouraging. Then I tried al-
ternate words, but neither &#8216;the of for&#8217; nor &#8216;supply
game London&#8217; promised to throw any light upon
</p>
<p>it.
&#8220;And then in an instant the key of the riddle
</p>
<p>was in my hands, and I saw that every third word,
beginning with the first, would give a message
which might well drive old Trevor to despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was short and terse, the warning, as I now
read it to my companion:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for
your life.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking
hands, &#8216;It must be that, I suppose,&#8217; said he. &#8220;This
is worse than death, for it means disgrace as well.
But what is the meaning of these &#8220;head-keepers&#8221;
and &#8220;hen-pheasants&#8221;?
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It means nothing to the message, but it might
mean a good deal to us if we had no other means
of discovering the sender. You see that he has be-
gun by writing &#8220;The . . . game . . . is,&#8221; and so on.
Afterwards he had, to fulfill the prearranged ci-
pher, to fill in any two words in each space. He
would naturally use the first words which came
to his mind, and if there were so many which re-
ferred to sport among them, you may be tolerably
sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested in
breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Why, now that you mention it,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I
remember that my poor father used to have an in-
vitation from him to shoot over his preserves every
autumn.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then it is undoubtedly from him that the
note comes,&#8217; said I. &#8216;It only remains for us to find
out what this secret was which the sailor Hudson
seems to have held over the heads of these two
wealthy and respected men.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and
shame!&#8217; cried my friend. &#8216;But from you I shall have
no secrets. Here is the statement which was drawn
up by my father when he knew that the danger
from Hudson had become imminent. I found it in
the Japanese cabinet, as he told the doctor. Take it
and read it to me, for I have neither the strength
nor the courage to do it myself.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the very papers, Watson, which he
handed to me, and I will read them to you, as I
read them in the old study that night to him. They
are endorsed outside, as you see, &#8216;Some particu-
lars of the voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her
leaving Falmouth on the 8th October, 1855, to her
destruction in N. Lat. 15&#9702;20&#8217;, W. Long. 25&#9702;14&#8217; on
Nov. 6th.&#8217; It is in the form of a letter, and runs in
this way:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;My dear, dear son, now that approaching dis-
grace begins to darken the closing years of my life,
I can write with all truth and honesty that it is not
</p>
<p>323</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The &#8220;Gloria Scott&#8221;
</p>
<p>the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my posi-
tion in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all
who have known me, which cuts me to the heart;
but it is the thought that you should come to blush
for me&#8212;you who love me and who have seldom,
I hope, had reason to do other than respect me.
But if the blow falls which is forever hanging over
me, then I should wish you to read this, that you
may know straight from me how far I have been
to blame. On the other hand, if all should go well
(which may kind God Almighty grant!), then if by
any chance this paper should be still undestroyed
and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by
all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear
mother, and by the love which had been between
us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give one
thought to it again.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If then your eye goes onto read this line, I
know that I shall already have been exposed and
dragged from my home, or as is more likely, for
you know that my heart is weak, by lying with
my tongue sealed forever in death. In either case
the time for suppression is past, and every word
which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I swear
as I hope for mercy.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James
Armitage in my younger days, and you can un-
derstand now the shock that it was to me a few
weeks ago when your college friend addressed me
in words which seemed to imply that he had sur-
prised my secret. As Armitage it was that I en-
tered a London banking-house, and as Armitage
I was convicted of breaking my country&#8217;s laws,
and was sentenced to transportation. Do not think
very harshly of me, laddie. It was a debt of honor,
so called, which I had to pay, and I used money
which was not my own to do it, in the certainty
that I could replace it before there could be any
possibility of its being missed. But the most dread-
ful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had
reckoned upon never came to hand, and a prema-
ture examination of accounts exposed my deficit.
The case might have been dealt leniently with, but
the laws were more harshly administered thirty
years ago than now, and on my twenty-third birth-
day I found myself chained as a felon with thirty-
seven other convicts in &#8217;tween-decks of the bark
Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It was the year &#8217;55 when the Crimean war
was at its height, and the old convict ships had
been largely used as transports in the Black Sea.
The government was compelled, therefore, to use
smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out
their prisoners. The Gloria Scott had been in the
</p>
<p>Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new
clippers had cut her out. She was a five-hundred-
ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she
carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four
warders. Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all
told, when we set said from Falmouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The partitions between the cells of the con-
victs, instead of being of thick oak, as is usual in
convict-ships, were quite thin and frail. The man
next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I
had particularly noticed when we were led down
the quay. He was a young man with a clear, hair-
less face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker
jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air,
had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above
all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. I
don&#8217;t think any of our heads would have come up
to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not
have measured less than six and a half feet. It was
strange among so many sad and weary faces to see
one which was full of energy and resolution. The
sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor,
and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I
heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that
he had managed to cut an opening in the board
which separated us.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Hullo, chummy!&#8221; said he, &#8220;what&#8217;s your
name, and what are you here for?&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I answered him, and asked in turn who I was
talking with.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;m Jack Prendergast,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and by
God! You&#8217;ll learn to bless my name before you&#8217;ve
done with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I remembered hearing of his case, for it
was one which had made an immense sensation
throughout the country some time before my own
arrest. He was a man of good family and of great
ability, but on incurably vicious habits, who had be
an ingenious system of fraud obtained huge sums
of money from the leading London merchants.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Ha, ha! You remember my case!&#8221; said he
proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Very well, indeed.&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Then maybe you remember something
</p>
<p>queer about it?&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;What was that, then?&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;d had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn&#8217;t
</p>
<p>I?&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;So it was said.&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;But none was recovered, eh?&#8221;
&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>324</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Well, where d&#8217;ye suppose the balance is?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I have no idea,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;Right between my finger and thumb,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;By God! I&#8217;ve go more pounds to my name
than you&#8217;ve hairs on your head. And if you&#8217;ve
money, my son, and know how to handle it and
spread it, you can do anything. Now, you don&#8217;t
think it likely that a man who could do anything is
going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stink-
ing hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy
old coffin of a Chin China coaster. No, sir, such
a man will look after himself and will look after
his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to
him, and you may kiss the book that he&#8217;ll haul you
through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;That was his style of talk, and at first I
thought it meant nothing; but after a while, when
he had tested me and sworn me in with all pos-
sible solemnity, he let me understand that there
really was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A
dozen of the prisoners had hatched it before they
came aboard, Prendergast was the leader, and his
money was the motive power.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;I&#8217;d a partner,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a rare good man, as
true as a stock to a barrel. He&#8217;s got the dibbs, he
has, and where do you think he is at this moment?
Why, he&#8217;s the chaplain of this ship&#8212;the chaplain,
no less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his
papers right, and money enough in his box to buy
the thing right up from keel to main-truck. The
crew are his, body and soul. He could buy &#8217;em at
so much a gross with a cash discount, and he did
it before ever they signed on. He&#8217;s got two of the
warders and Mereer, the second mate, and he&#8217;d get
the captain himself, if he thought him worth it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;What are we to do, then?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; said he. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make
the coats of some of these soldiers redder than ever
the tailor did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;But they are armed,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216; &#8220;And so shall we be, my boy. There&#8217;s a brace
of pistols for every mother&#8217;s son of us, and if we
can&#8217;t carry this ship, with the crew at our back, it&#8217;s
time we were all sent to a young misses&#8217; boarding-
school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-
night, and see if he is to be trusted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I did so, and found my other neighbor to be
a young fellow in much the same position as my-
self, whose crime had been forgery. His name was
Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself,
and he is now a rich and prosperous man in the
south of England. He was ready enough to join
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, as the only means of saving our-
selves, and before we had crossed the Bay there
were only two of the prisoners who were not in
the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we
did not dare to trust him, and the other was suf-
fering from jaundice, and could not be of any use
to us.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;From the beginning there was really nothing
to prevent us from taking possession of the ship.
The crew were a set of ruffians, specially picked
for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells
to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be
full of tracts, and so often did he come that by the
third day we had each stowed away at the foot of
our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of pow-
der, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were
agents of Prendergast, and the second mate was
his right-hand man. The captain, the two mates,
two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen sol-
diers, and the doctor were all that we had against
us. Yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect
no precaution, and to make our attack suddenly
by night. It came, however, more quickly than we
expected, and in this way.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;One evening, about the third week after our
start, the doctor had come down to see one of the
prisoners who was ill, and putting his hand down
on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of
the pistols. If he had been silent he might have
blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous lit-
tle chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned
so pale that the man knew what was up in an in-
stant and seized him. He was gagged before he
could give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed.
He had unlocked the door that led to the deck,
and we were through it in a rush. The two sen-
tries were shot down, and so was a corporal who
came running to see what was the matter. There
were two more soldiers at the door of the state-
room, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded,
for they never fired upon us, and they were shot
while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed
on into the captain&#8217;s cabin, but as we pushed open
the door there was an explosion from within, and
there he lay with his brains smeared over the chart
of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table,
while the chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in
his hand at his elbow. The two mates had both
been seized by the crew, and the whole business
seemed to be settled.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The state-room was next the cabin, and we
flocked in there and flopped down on the settees,
all speaking together, for we were just mad with
the feeling that we were free once more. There

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The &#8220;Gloria Scott&#8221;
</p>
<p>were lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham chap-
lain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a
dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks
of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers,
and were just tossing them off, when in an instant
without warning there came the roar of muskets in
our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that
we could not see across the table. When it cleared
again the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight
others were wriggling on the top of each other on
the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on
that table turn me sick now when I think of it. We
were so cowed by the sight that I think we should
have given the job up if had not been for Prender-
gast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the
door with all that were left alive at his heels. Out
we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenent
and ten of his men. The swing skylights above
the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had
fired on us through the slit. We got on them be-
fore they could load, and they stood to it like men;
but we had the upper hand of them, and in five
minutes it was all over. My God! Was there ever a
slaughter-house like that ship! Predergast was like
a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if
they had been children and threw them overboard
alive or dead. T
