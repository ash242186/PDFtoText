<p>t was some time before the health of my
friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes recovered
from the strain caused by his immense
exertions in the spring of &#8217;87. The whole
</p>
<p>question of the Netherland-Sumatra Company and
of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis are
too recent in the minds of the public, and are too
intimately concerned with politics and finance to
be fitting subjects for this series of sketches. They
led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular
and complex problem which gave my friend an
opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh
weapon among the many with which he waged his
life-long battle against crime.
</p>
<p>On referring to my notes I see that it was upon
the 14th of April that I received a telegram from
Lyons which informed me that Holmes was lying
ill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four hours I
was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that
there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.
Even his iron constitution, however, had broken
down under the strain of an investigation which
had extended over two months, during which pe-
riod he had never worked less than fifteen hours
a day, and had more than once, as he assured me,
kept to his task for five days at a stretch. Even the
triumphant issue of his labors could not save him
from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at
a time when Europe was ringing with his name
and when his room was literally ankle-deep with
congratulatory telegrams I found him a prey to the
blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he
had succeeded where the police of three countries
had failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at ev-
ery point the most accomplished swindler in Eu-
rope, was insufficient to rouse him from his ner-
vous prostration.
</p>
<p>Three days later we were back in Baker Street
together; but it was evident that my friend would
be much the better for a change, and the thought
of a week of spring time in the country was full
of attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel
Hayter, who had come under my professional
care in Afghanistan, had now taken a house near
Reigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to
come down to him upon a visit. On the last oc-
casion he had remarked that if my friend would
only come with me he would be glad to extend
his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was
needed, but when Holmes understood that the es-
tablishment was a bachelor one, and that he would
be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my
plans and a week after our return from Lyons we
were under the Colonel&#8217;s roof. Hayter was a fine
old soldier who had seen much of the world, and
</p>
<p>he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and
he had much in common.
</p>
<p>On the evening of our arrival we were sitting
in the Colonel&#8217;s gun-room after dinner, Holmes
stretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked
over his little armory of Eastern weapons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said he suddenly, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll
take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case
we have an alarm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An alarm!&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve had a scare in this part lately. Old
</p>
<p>Acton, who is one of our county magnates, had his
house broken into last Monday. No great damage
done, but the fellows are still at large.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No clue?&#8221; asked Holmes, cocking his eye at
the Colonel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None as yet. But the affair is a pretty one,
one of our little country crimes, which must seem
too small for your attention, Mr. Holmes, after this
great international affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes waved away the compliment, though
his smile showed that it had pleased him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there any feature of interest?&#8221;
&#8220;I fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library
</p>
<p>and got very little for their pains. The whole place
was turned upside down, drawers burst open, and
presses ransacked, with the result that an odd vol-
ume of Pope&#8217;s Homer, two plated candlesticks, an
ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a
ball of twine are all that have vanished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary assortment!&#8221; I ex-
claimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of ev-
erything they could get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes grunted from the sofa.
&#8220;The county police ought to make something
</p>
<p>of that,&#8221; said he; &#8220;why, it is surely obvious that&#8212;&#8221;
But I held up a warning finger.
&#8220;You are here for a rest, my dear fellow. For
</p>
<p>Heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t get started on a new problem
when your nerves are all in shreds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance
of comic resignation towards the Colonel, and the
talk drifted away into less dangerous channels.
</p>
<p>It was destined, however, that all my profes-
sional caution should be wasted, for next morning
the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way
that it was impossible to ignore it, and our country
visit took a turn which neither of us could have an-
ticipated. We were at breakfast when the Colonel&#8217;s
butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out
of him.
</p>
<p>343</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Reigate Puzzle
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard the news, sir?&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;At the Cunningham&#8217;s sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglary!&#8221; cried the Colonel, with his coffee-
cup in mid-air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel whistled. &#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s killed, then? The J.P. or his son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither, sir. It was William the coachman.
Shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who shot him, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got
clean away. He&#8217;d just broke in at the pantry win-
dow when William came on him and met his end
in saving his master&#8217;s property.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was last night, sir, somewhere about
twelve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, we&#8217;ll step over afterwards,&#8221; said
the Colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast
again. &#8220;It&#8217;s a baddish business,&#8221; he added when
the butler had gone; &#8220;he&#8217;s our leading man about
here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fel-
low too. He&#8217;ll be cut up over this, for the man has
been in his service for years and was a good ser-
vant. It&#8217;s evidently the same villains who broke
into Acton&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And stole that very singular collection,&#8221; said
Holmes, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! It may prove the simplest matter in the
world, but all the same at first glance this is just a
little curious, is it not? A gang of burglars acting
in the country might be expected to vary the scene
of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in
the same district within a few days. When you
spoke last night of taking precautions I remem-
ber that it passed through my mind that this was
probably the last parish in England to which the
thief or thieves would be likely to turn their atten-
tion&#8212;which shows that I have still much to learn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy it&#8217;s some local practitioner,&#8221; said the
Colonel. &#8220;In that case, of course, Acton&#8217;s and
Cunningham&#8217;s are just the places he would go for,
since they are far the largest about here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And richest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they ought to be, but they&#8217;ve had a law-
suit for some years which has sucked the blood out
of both of them, I fancy. Old Acton has some claim
on half Cunningham&#8217;s estate, and the lawyers have
been at it with both hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a local villain there should not be much
difficulty in running him down,&#8221; said Holmes
with a yawn. &#8220;All right, Watson, I don&#8217;t intend
to meddle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspector Forrester, sir,&#8221; said the butler,
throwing open the door.
</p>
<p>The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow,
stepped into the room. &#8220;Good-morning, Colonel,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;I hope I don&#8217;t intrude, but we hear that
Mr. Holmes of Baker Street is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel waved his hand towards my
friend, and the Inspector bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that perhaps you would care to
step across, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fates are against you, Watson,&#8221; said he,
laughing. &#8220;We were chatting about the matter
when you came in, Inspector. Perhaps you can let
us have a few details.&#8221; As he leaned back in his
chair in the familiar attitude I knew that the case
was hopeless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had no clue in the Acton affair. But here
we have plenty to go on, and there&#8217;s no doubt it is
the same party in each case. The man was seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the
</p>
<p>shot that killed poor William Kirwan was fired.
Mr. Cunningham saw him from the bedroom win-
dow, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him from
the back passage. It was quarter to twelve when
the alarm broke out. Mr. Cunningham had just
got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe
in his dressing-gown. They both heard William
the coachman calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran
down to see what was the matter. The back door
was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs
he saw two men wrestling together outside. One
of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the
murderer rushed across the garden and over the
hedge. Mr. Cunningham, looking out of his bed-
room, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but
lost sight of him at once. Mr. Alec stopped to see
if he could help the dying man, and so the vil-
lain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he was a
middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff,
we have no personal clue; but we are making en-
ergetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall
soon find him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was this William doing there? Did he
say anything before he died?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. He lives at the lodge with his
mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow we
imagine that he walked up to the house with the
intention of seeing that all was right there. Of
course this Acton business has put every one on
</p>
<p>344</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>their guard. The robber must have just burst open
the door&#8212;the lock has been forced&#8212;when William
came upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did William say anything to his mother before
going out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very old and deaf, and we can get no in-
formation from her. The shock has made her half-
witted, but I understand that she was never very
bright. There is one very important circumstance,
however. Look at this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took a small piece of torn paper from a
note-book and spread it out upon his knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was found between the finger and thumb
of the dead man. It appears to be a fragment torn
from a larger sheet. You will observe that the hour
mentioned upon it is the very time at which the
poor fellow met his fate. You see that his mur-
derer might have torn the rest of the sheet from
him or he might have taken this fragment from the
murderer. It reads almost as though it were an ap-
pointment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a facsimile
of which is here reproduced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Presuming that it is an appointment,&#8221; contin-
ued the Inspector, &#8220;it is of course a conceivable the-
ory that this William Kirwan&#8212;though he had the
reputation of being an honest man, may have been
in league with the thief. He may have met him
there, may even have helped him to break in the
door, and then they may have fallen out between
themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This writing is of extraordinary interest,&#8221; said
Holmes, who had been examining it with intense
concentration. &#8220;These are much deeper waters
than I had thought.&#8221; He sank his head upon his
hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect
which his case had had upon the famous London
specialist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your last remark,&#8221; said Holmes, presently, &#8220;as
to the possibility of there being an understanding
between the burglar and the servant, and this be-
ing a note of appointment from one to the other,
is an ingenious and not entirely impossible suppo-
sition. But this writing opens up&#8212;&#8221; He sank his
</p>
<p>head into his hands again and remained for some
minutes in the deepest thought. When he raised
his face again, I was surprised to see that his cheek
was tinged with color, and his eyes as bright as be-
fore his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his
old energy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I should like to
have a quiet little glance into the details of this
case. There is something in it which fascinates me
extremely. If you will permit me, Colonel, I will
leave my friend Watson and you, and I will step
round with the Inspector to test the truth of one or
two little fancies of mine. I will be with you again
in half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An hour and half had elapsed before the In-
spector returned alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes is walking up and down in the
field outside,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He wants us all four to go
up to the house together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
quite know, sir. Between ourselves, I think Mr.
Holmes had not quite got over his illness yet. He&#8217;s
been behaving very queerly, and he is very much
excited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need alarm yourself,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I have usually found that there was method in his
madness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks might say there was madness in
his method,&#8221; muttered the Inspector. &#8220;But he&#8217;s all
on fire to start, Colonel, so we had best go out if
you are ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We found Holmes pacing up and down in the
field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands
thrust into his trousers pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter grows in interest,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Wat-
son, your country-trip has been a distinct success.
I have had a charming morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been up to the scene of the crime, I
understand,&#8221; said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the Inspector and I have made quite a lit-
tle reconnaissance together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any success?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have seen some very interesting
things. I&#8217;ll tell you what we did as we walk. First
of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man.
He certainly died from a revolver wound as re-
ported.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you doubted it, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>345</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Reigate Puzzle
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is as well to test everything. Our in-
spection was not wasted. We then had an inter-
view with Mr. Cunningham and his son, who were
able to point out the exact spot where the mur-
derer had broken through the garden-hedge in his
flight. That was of great interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;
&#8220;Then we had a look at this poor fellow&#8217;s
</p>
<p>mother. We could get no information from her,
however, as she is very old and feeble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is the result of your investigations?&#8221;
&#8220;The conviction that the crime is a very pecu-
</p>
<p>liar one. Perhaps our visit now may do something
to make it less obscure. I think that we are both
agreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in the
dead man&#8217;s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour
of his death written upon it, is of extreme impor-
tance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;It does give a clue. Whoever wrote that note
</p>
<p>was the man who brought William Kirwan out of
his bed at that hour. But where is the rest of that
sheet of paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I examined the ground carefully in the hope
of finding it,&#8221; said the Inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was torn out of the dead man&#8217;s hand. Why
was some one so anxious to get possession of it?
Because it incriminated him. And what would he
do with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely,
never noticing that a corner of it had been left in
the grip of the corpse. If we could get the rest of
that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a
long way towards solving the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but how can we get at the criminal&#8217;s
pocket before we catch the criminal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, it was worth thinking over. Then
there is another obvious point. The note was sent
to William. The man who wrote it could not have
taken it; otherwise, of course, he might have de-
livered his own message by word of mouth. Who
brought the note, then? Or did it come through
the post?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made inquiries,&#8221; said the Inspector.
&#8220;William received a letter by the afternoon post
yesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Holmes, clapping the Inspec-
tor on the back. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the postman. It is a
pleasure to work with you. Well, here is the lodge,
and if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you
the scene of the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We passed the pretty cottage where the mur-
dered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined
</p>
<p>avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which
bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the
door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it
until we came to the side gate, which is separated
by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines
the road. A constable was standing at the kitchen
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw the door open, officer,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Now, it was on those stairs that young Mr. Cun-
ningham stood and saw the two men struggling
just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at
that window&#8212;the second on the left&#8212;and he saw
the fellow get away just to the left of that bush.
So did the son.They are both sure of it on account
of the bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt be-
side the wounded man. The ground is very hard,
you see, and there are no marks to guide us.&#8221; As
he spoke two men came down the garden path,
from round the angle of the house. The one was
an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-
eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose
bright, smiling expression and showy dress were
in strange contrast with the business which had
brought us there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still at it, then?&#8221; said he to Holmes. &#8220;I thought
you Londoners were never at fault. You don&#8217;t seem
to be so very quick, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you must give us a little time,&#8221; said
Holmes good-humoredly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want it,&#8221; said young Alec Cunningham.
&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t see that we have any clue at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one,&#8221; answered the Inspector.
&#8220;We thought that if we could only find&#8212;Good
heavens, Mr. Holmes! What is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>My poor friend&#8217;s face had suddenly assumed
the most dreadful expression. His eyes rolled up-
wards, his features writhed in agony, and with a
suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the
ground. Horrified at the suddenness and sever-
ity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen,
where he lay back in a large chair, and breathed
heavily for some minutes. Finally, with a shame-
faced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson would tell you that I have only just re-
covered from a severe illness,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I am
liable to these sudden nervous attacks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I send you home in my trap?&#8221; asked old
Cunningham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since I am here, there is one point on
which I should like to feel sure. We can very eas-
ily verify it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>346</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, it seems to me that it is just possible that
the arrival of this poor fellow William was not be-
fore, but after, the entrance of the burglary into the
house. You appear to take it for granted that, al-
though the door was forced, the robber never got
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy that is quite obvious,&#8221; said Mr. Cun-
ningham, gravely. &#8220;Why, my son Alec had not yet
gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard
any one moving about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was he sitting?&#8221;
&#8220;I was smoking in my dressing-room.&#8221;
&#8220;Which window is that?&#8221;
&#8220;The last on the left next my father&#8217;s.&#8221;
&#8220;Both of your lamps were lit, of course?&#8221;
&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#8221;
&#8220;There are some very singular points here,&#8221;
</p>
<p>said Holmes, smiling. &#8220;Is it not extraordinary that
a burglary&#8212;and a burglar who had had some pre-
vious experience&#8212;should deliberately break into a
house at a time when he could see from the lights
that two of the family were still afoot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have been a cool hand.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, of course, if the case were not an odd
</p>
<p>one we should not have been driven to ask you
for an explanation,&#8221; said young Mr. Alec. &#8220;But as
to your ideas that the man had robbed the house
before William tackled him, I think it a most ab-
surd notion. Wouldn&#8217;t we have found the place
disarranged, and missed the things which he had
taken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on what the things were,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;You must remember that we are dealing
with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and
who appears to work on lines of his own. Look,
for example, at the queer lot of things which he
took from Acton&#8217;s&#8212;what was it?&#8212;a ball of string,
a letter-weight, and I don&#8217;t know what other odds
and ends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said old Cunningham. &#8220;Anything which
you or the Inspector may suggest will most cer-
tainly be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;I should
like you to offer a reward&#8212;coming from yourself,
for the officials may take a little time before they
would agree upon the sum, and these things can-
not be done too promptly. I have jotted down the
form here, if you would not mind signing it. Fifty
pound was quite enough, I thought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would willingly give five hundred,&#8221; said the
J.P., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which
</p>
<p>Holmes handed to him. &#8220;This is not quite correct,
however,&#8221; he added, glancing over the document.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote it rather hurriedly.&#8221;
&#8220;You see you begin, &#8216;Whereas, at about a quar-
</p>
<p>ter to one on Tuesday morning an attempt was
made,&#8217; and so on. It was at a quarter to twelve,
as a matter of fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how
keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. It
was his specialty to be accurate as to fact, but his
recent illness had shaken him, and this one little
incident was enough to show me that he was still
far from being himself. He was obviously embar-
rassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised
his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into a
laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake,
however, and handed the paper back to Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it printed as soon as possible,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I
think your idea is an excellent one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away
into his pocket-book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it really would be a good
thing that we should all go over the house together
and make certain that this rather erratic burglar
did not, after all, carry anything away with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before entering, Holmes made an examination
of the door which had been forced. It was evident
that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in,
and the lock forced back with it. We could see the
marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t use bars, then?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;We have never found it necessary.&#8221;
&#8220;You don&#8217;t keep a dog?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, but he is chained on the other side of the
</p>
<p>house.&#8221;
&#8220;When do the servants go to bed?&#8221;
&#8220;About ten.&#8221;
&#8220;I understand that William was usually in bed
</p>
<p>also at that hour.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;It is singular that on this particular night he
</p>
<p>should have been up. Now, I should be very glad
if you would have the kindness to show us over
the house, Mr. Cunningham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens
branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase
directly to the first floor of the house. It came out
upon the landing opposite to a second more or-
namental stair which came up from the front hall.
Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and
several bedrooms, including those of Mr. Cunning-
ham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking
</p>
<p>347</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Reigate Puzzle
</p>
<p>keen note of the architecture of the house. I could
tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent,
and yet I could not in the least imagine in what
direction his inferences were leading him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My good sir,&#8221; said Mr. Cunningham with
some impatience, &#8220;this is surely very unnecessary.
That is my room at the end of the stairs, and my
son&#8217;s is the one beyond it. I leave it to your judg-
ment whether it was possible for the thief to have
come up here without disturbing us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must try round and get on a fresh scent, I
fancy,&#8221; said the son with a rather malicious smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I must ask you to humor me a little
further. I should like, for example, to see how
far the windows of the bedrooms command the
front. This, I understand is your son&#8217;s room&#8221;&#8212;he
pushed open the door&#8212;&#8220;and that, I presume, is
the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when
the alarm was given. Where does the window
of that look out to?&#8221; He stepped across the bed-
room, pushed open the door, and glanced round
the other chamber.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that you are satisfied now?&#8221; said Mr.
Cunningham, tartly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I think I have seen all that I
wished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if it is really necessary we can go into
my room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is not too much trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The J.P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the
way into his own chamber, which was a plainly
furnished and commonplace room. As we moved
across it in the direction of the window, Holmes
fell back until he and I were the last of the group.
Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges
and a carafe of water. As we passed it Holmes, to
my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front
of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing
over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces
and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done it now, Watson,&#8221; said he, coolly.
&#8220;A pretty mess you&#8217;ve made of the carpet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stooped in some confusion and began to pick
up the fruit, understanding for some reason my
companion desired me to take the blame upon my-
self. The others did the same, and set the table on
its legs again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; cried the Inspector, &#8220;where&#8217;s he got
to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here an instant,&#8221; said young Alec Cun-
ningham. &#8220;The fellow is off his head, in my opin-
ion. Come with me, father, and see where he has
got to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They rushed out of the room, leaving the In-
spector, the Colonel, and me staring at each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word, I am inclined to agree with
Master Alec,&#8221; said the official. &#8220;It may be the effect
of this illness, but it seems to me that&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>His words were cut short by a sudden scream
of &#8220;Help! Help! Murder!&#8221; With a thrill I recog-
nized the voice of that of my friend. I rushed
madly from the room on to the landing. The cries,
which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate
shouting, came from the room which we had first
visited. I dashed in, and on into the dressing-
room beyond. The two Cunninghams were bend-
ing over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes,
the younger clutching his throat with both hands,
while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his
wrists. In an instant the three of us had torn them
away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet,
very pale and evidently greatly exhausted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrest these men, Inspector,&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;On what charge?&#8221;
&#8220;That of murdering their coachman, William
</p>
<p>Kirwan.&#8221;
The Inspector stared about him in bewilder-
</p>
<p>ment. &#8220;Oh, come now, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he at
last, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t really mean to&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, man, look at their faces!&#8221; cried Holmes,
curtly.
</p>
<p>Never certainly have I seen a plainer confes-
sion of guilt upon human countenances. The older
man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy,
sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face.
The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that
jaunty, dashing style which had characterized him,
and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed
in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome fea-
tures. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to
the door, he blew his whistle. Two of his consta-
bles came at the call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no alternative, Mr. Cunningham,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I trust that this may all prove to be an absurd
mistake, but you can see that&#8212;Ah, would you?
Drop it!&#8221; He struck out with his hand, and a re-
volver which the younger man was in the act of
cocking clattered down upon the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep that,&#8221; said Holmes, quietly putting his
foot upon it; &#8220;you will find it useful at the trial.
But this is what we really wanted.&#8221; He held up a
little crumpled piece of paper.
</p>
<p>348</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;The remainder of the sheet!&#8221; cried the Inspec-
tor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;
&#8220;And where was it?&#8221;
&#8220;Where I was sure it must be. I&#8217;ll make the
</p>
<p>whole matter clear to you presently. I think,
Colonel, that you and Watson might return now,
and I will be with you again in an hour at the fur-
thest. The Inspector and I must have a word with
the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at
luncheon time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for
about one o&#8217;clock he rejoined us in the Colonel&#8217;s
smoking-room. He was accompanied by a little el-
derly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the
Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the
original burglary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wished Mr. Acton to be present while I
demonstrated this small matter to you,&#8221; said
Holmes, &#8220;for it is natural that he should take a
keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear
Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you
took in such a stormy petrel as I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; answered the Colonel,
warmly, &#8220;I consider it the greatest privilege to have
been permitted to study your methods of working.
I confess that they quite surpass my expectations,
and that I am utterly unable to account for your
result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that my explanation may disillu-
sion you but it has always been my habit to hide
none of my methods, either from my friend Wat-
son or from any one who might take an intelligent
interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken
by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-
room, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of
your brandy, Colonel. My strength had been rather
tried of late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that you had no more of those nervous
attacks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. &#8220;We will
come to that in its turn,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I will lay an
account of the case before you in its due order,
showing you the various points which guided me
in my decision. Pray interrupt me if there is any
inference which is not perfectly clear to you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of the highest importance in the art of de-
tection to be able to recognize, out of a number of
facts, which are incidental and which vital. Other-
wise your energy and attention must be dissipated
instead of being concentrated. Now, in this case
there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from
the first that the key of the whole matter must be
</p>
<p>looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man&#8217;s
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before going into this, I would draw your at-
tention to the fact that, if Alec Cunningham&#8217;s nar-
rative was correct, and if the assailant, after shoot-
ing William Kirwan, had instantly fled, then it ob-
viously could not be he who tore the paper from
the dead man&#8217;s hand. But if it was not he, it must
have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the
time that the old man had descended several ser-
vants were upon the scene. The point is a sim-
ple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it be-
cause he had started with the supposition that
these county magnates had had nothing to do with
the matter. Now, I make a point of never having
any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever
fact may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of
the investigation, I found myself looking a little
askance at the part which had been played by Mr.
Alec Cunningham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I made a very careful examination of
the corner of paper which the Inspector had sub-
mitted to us. It was at once clear to me that it
formed part of a very remarkable document. Here
it is. Do you not now observed something very
suggestive about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has a very irregular look,&#8221; said the Colonel.
&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; cried Holmes, &#8220;there cannot be
</p>
<p>the least doubt in the world that it has been writ-
ten by two persons doing alternate words. When
I draw your attention to the strong t&#8217;s of &#8216;at&#8217; and
&#8216;to&#8217;, and ask you to compare them with the weak
ones of &#8216;quarter&#8217; and &#8216;twelve,&#8217; you will instantly
recognize the fact. A very brief analysis of these
four words would enable you to say with the ut-
most confidence that the &#8216;learn&#8217; and the &#8216;maybe&#8217;
are written in the stronger hand, and the &#8216;what&#8217; in
the weaker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, it&#8217;s as clear as day!&#8221; cried the Colonel.
&#8220;Why on earth should two men write a letter in
such a fashion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously the business was a bad one, and
one of the men who distrusted the other was deter-
mined that, whatever was done, each should have
an equal hand in it. Now, of the two men, it is
clear that the one who wrote the &#8216;at&#8217; and &#8216;to&#8217; was
the ringleader.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get at that?&#8221;
&#8220;We might deduce it from the mere character
</p>
<p>of the one hand as compared with the other. But
we have more assured reasons than that for sup-
posing it. If you examine this scrap with attention
you will come to the conclusion that the man with
the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving
</p>
<p>349</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Reigate Puzzle
</p>
<p>blanks for the other to fill up. These blanks were
not always sufficient, and you can see that the sec-
ond man had a squeeze to fit his &#8216;quarter&#8217; in be-
tween the &#8216;at&#8217; and the &#8216;to,&#8217; showing that the latter
were already written. The man who wrote all his
words first in undoubtedly the man who planned
the affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Mr. Acton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But very superficial,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;We come
now, however, to a point which is of importance.
You may not be aware that the deduction of a
man&#8217;s age from his writing is one which has
brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In
normal cases one can place a man in his true
decade with tolerable confidence. I say normal
cases, because ill-health and physical weakness re-
produce the signs of old age, even when the in-
valid is a youth. In this case, looking at the bold,
strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-
backed appearance of the other, which still retains
its legibility although the t&#8217;s have begun to lose
their crossing, we can say that the one was a young
man and the other was advanced in years without
being positively decrepit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Mr. Acton again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a further point, however, which is
subtler and of greater interest. There is something
in common between these hands. They belong to
men who are blood-relatives. It may be most ob-
vious to you in the Greek e&#8217;s, but to me there are
many small points which indicate the same thing.
I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism
can be traced in these two specimens of writing.
I am only, of course, giving you the leading results
now of my examination of the paper. There were
twenty-three other deductions which would be of
more interest to experts than to you. They all tend
to deepen the impression upon my mind that the
Cunninghams, father and son, had written this let-
ter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Having got so far, my next step was, of course,
to examine into the details of the crime, and to
see how far they would help us. I went up to the
house with the Inspector, and saw all that was to
be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as
I was able to determine with absolute confidence,
fired from a revolver at the distance of something
over four yards. There was no powder-blackening
on the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunning-
ham had lied when he said that the two men were
struggling when the shot was fired. Again, both
father and son agreed as to the place where the
man escaped into the road. At that point, how-
ever, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist
</p>
<p>at the bottom. As there were no indications of
bootmarks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure
not only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but
that there had never been any unknown man upon
the scene at all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I have to consider the motive of this
singular crime. To get at this, I endeavored first of
all to solve the reason of the original burglary at
Mr. Acton&#8217;s. I understood, from something which
the Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been go-
ing o
