<p>t can&#8217;t hurt now,&#8221; was Mr. Sherlock
Holmes&#8217;s comment when, for the tenth
time in as many years, I asked his leave
to reveal the following narrative. So it
</p>
<p>was that at last I obtained permission to put on
record what was, in some ways, the supreme mo-
ment of my friend&#8217;s career.
</p>
<p>Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the
Turkish bath. It was over a smoke in the pleas-
ant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found
him less reticent and more human than anywhere
else. On the upper floor of the Northumberland
Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner
where two couches lie side by side, and it was
on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the
day when my narrative begins. I had asked him
whether anything was stirring, and for answer he
had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the
sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an
envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which
hung beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be some fussy, self-important fool; it
may be a matter of life or death,&#8221; said he as he
handed me the note. &#8220;I know no more than this
message tells me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was from the Carlton Club and dated the
evening before. This is what I read:
</p>
<p>Sir James Damery presents his com-
pliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and
will call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow.
Sir James begs to say that the matter
upon which he desires to consult Mr.
Holmes is very delicate and also very
important. He trusts, therefore, that
Mr. Holmes will make every effort to
grant this interview, and that he will
confirm it over the telephone to the
Carlton Club.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not say that I have confirmed it, Wat-
son,&#8221; said Holmes as I returned the paper. &#8220;Do
you know anything of this man Damery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that this name is a household word in
society.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you a little more than that. He
has rather a reputation for arranging delicate mat-
ters which are to be kept out of the papers. You
may remember his negotiations with Sir George
Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man
of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I
am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false
scent and that he has some real need for our assis-
tance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, if you will be so good, Watson.&#8221;
&#8220;I shall be honoured.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you have the hour&#8212;4.30. Until then we
</p>
<p>can put the matter out of our heads.&#8221;
I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne
</p>
<p>Street at the time, but I was round at Baker Street
before the time named. Sharp to the half-hour,
Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. It is
hardly necessary to describe him, for many will
remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that
broad, clean-shaven face, and, above all, that pleas-
ant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his gray
Irish eyes, and good humour played round his
mobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark
frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin
in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over
the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care
in dress for which he was famous. The big, mas-
terful aristocrat dominated the little room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson,&#8221;
he remarked with a courteous bow. &#8220;His collabo-
ration may be very necessary, for we are dealing
on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom
violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at
nothing. I should say that there is no more dan-
gerous man in Europe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had several opponents to whom that
flattering term has been applied,&#8221; said Holmes
with a smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you smoke? Then you will
excuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more
dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than
the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is in-
deed worth meeting. May I ask his name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?&#8221;
&#8220;You mean the Austrian murderer?&#8221;
Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved
</p>
<p>hands with a laugh. &#8220;There is no getting past
you, Mr. Holmes! Wonderful! So you have already
sized him up as a murderer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my business to follow the details of Conti-
nental crime. Who could possibly have read what
happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the
man&#8217;s guilt! It was a purely technical legal point
and the suspicious death of a witness that saved
him! I am as sure that he killed his wife when the
so-called &#8216;accident&#8217; happened in the Splugen Pass
as if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he
had come to England and had a presentiment that
sooner or later he would find me some work to
do. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I
presume it is not this old tragedy which has come
up again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>857</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Illustrious Client
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is more serious than that. To revenge
crime is important, but to prevent it is more so.
It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dread-
ful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself
before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it
will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it.
Can a human being be placed in a more trying po-
sition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you will sympathize with the client in
</p>
<p>whose interests I am acting.&#8221;
&#8220;I did not understand that you were merely an
</p>
<p>intermediary. Who is the principal?&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that
</p>
<p>question. It is important that I should be able to
assure him that his honoured name has been in
no way dragged into the matter. His motives are,
to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but
he prefers to remain unknown. I need not say
that your fees will be assured and that you will
be given a perfectly free hand. Surely the actual
name of your client is immaterial?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I am accustomed
to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have
it at both ends is too confusing. I fear, Sir James,
that I must decline to act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor was greatly disturbed. His large,
sensitive face was darkened with emotion and dis-
appointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hardly realize the effect of your own ac-
tion, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You place me in a
most serious dilemma, for I am perfectly certain
that you would be proud to take over the case if I
could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids
me from revealing them all. May I, at least, lay all
that I can before you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means, so long as it is understood that
I commit myself to nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is understood. In the first place, you have
no doubt heard of General de Merville?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;De Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young,
rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in
every way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent
girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the
clutches of a fiend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?&#8221;
&#8220;The strongest of all holds where a woman is
</p>
<p>concerned&#8212;the hold of love. The fellow is, as you
may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a
most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that
</p>
<p>air of romance and mystery which means so much
to a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his
mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how came such a man to meet a lady of
the standing of Miss Violet de Merville?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage.
The company, though select, paid their own pas-
sages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the
Baron&#8217;s true character until it was too late. The
villain attached himself to the lady, and with such
effect that he has completely and absolutely won
her heart. To say that she loves him hardly ex-
presses it. She dotes upon him; she is obsessed by
him. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She
will not hear one word against him. Everything
has been done to cure her of her madness, but in
vain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next
month. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is
hard to know how to prevent her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she know about the Austrian episode?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cunning devil has told her every un-
savoury public scandal of his past life, but always
in such a way as to make himself out to be an in-
nocent martyr. She absolutely accepts his version
and will listen to no other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! But surely you have inadvertently
let out the name of your client? It is no doubt
General de Merville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor fidgeted in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes,
but it would not be true. De Merville is a broken
man. The strong soldier has been utterly demoral-
ized by this incident. He has lost the nerve which
never failed him on the battlefield and has become
a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of
contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this
Austrian. My client, however, is an old friend, one
who has known the General intimately for many
years and taken a paternal interest in this young
girl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see
this tragedy consummated without some attempt
to stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard
can act. It was his own suggestion that you should
be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the
express stipulation that he should not be person-
ally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr.
Holmes, with your great powers you could easily
trace my client back through me, but I must ask
you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so,
and not to break in upon his incognito.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes gave a whimsical smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I may safely promise that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
may add that your problem interests me, and that
</p>
<p>858</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep
in touch with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Carlton Club will find me. But in case
of emergency, there is a private telephone call,
&#8216;XX.31.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling,
with the open memorandum-book upon his knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Baron&#8217;s present address, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large
house. He has been fortunate in some rather shady
speculations and is a rich man, which naturally
makes him a more dangerous antagonist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he at home at present?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apart from what you have told me, can you
give me any further information about the man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier.
For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham,
but then this Prague affair got noised about and he
had to leave. He collects books and pictures. He
is a man with a considerable artistic side to his na-
ture. He is, I believe, a recognized authority upon
Chinese pottery and has written a book upon the
subject.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A complex mind,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;All great
criminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace
was a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean
artist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James,
you will inform your client that I am turning my
mind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I
have some sources of information of my own, and
I dare say we may find some means of opening the
matter up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long
in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had
forgotten my presence. At last, however, he came
briskly back to earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, any views?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you had better see the young
lady herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father
cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail?
And yet there is something in the suggestion if all
else fails. But I think we must begin from a dif-
ferent angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson
might be a help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell
Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom
drawn my cases from the latter phases of my
friend&#8217;s career. During the first years of the cen-
tury he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I
</p>
<p>grieve to say, made his name first as a very dan-
gerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst.
Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes,
acting as his agent in the huge criminal under-
world of London and obtaining information which
often proved to be of vital importance. Had John-
son been a &#8220;nark&#8221; of the police he would soon have
been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which
never came directly into the courts, his activities
were never realized by his companions. With the
glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had
the entree of every night-club, doss house, and
gambling-den in the town, and his quick observa-
tion and active brain made him an ideal agent for
gaining information. It was to him that Sherlock
Holmes now proposed to turn.
</p>
<p>It was not possible for me to follow the imme-
diate steps taken by my friend, for I had some
pressing professional business of my own, but I
met him by appointment that evening at Simp-
son&#8217;s, where, sitting at a small table in the front
window and looking down at the rushing stream
of life in the Strand, he told me something of what
had passed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson is on the prowl,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He may
pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the
underworld, for it is down there, amid the black
roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man&#8217;s
secrets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the lady will not accept what is already
known, why should any fresh discovery of yours
turn her from her purpose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows, Watson? Woman&#8217;s heart and
mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder
might be condoned or explained, and yet some
smaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner re-
marked to me&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He remarked to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans.
Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with
my man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read
for myself the stuff that he is made of. When I
had given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out
to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable
mood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he recognize you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no difficulty about that, for I sim-
ply sent in my card. He is an excellent antagonist,
cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of
your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a
cobra. He has breeding in him&#8212;a real aristocrat of
crime, with a superficial suggestion of afternoon
tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. Yes, I
</p>
<p>859</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Illustrious Client
</p>
<p>am glad to have had my attention called to Baron
Adelbert Gruner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he was affable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective
mice. Some people&#8217;s affability is more deadly than
the violence of coarser souls. His greeting was
characteristic. &#8216;I rather thought I should see you
sooner or later, Mr. Holmes,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You have
been engaged, no doubt by General de Merville,
to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daugh-
ter, Violet. That is so, is it not?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I acquiesced.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;My dear man,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you will only ruin
your own well-deserved reputation. It is not a case
in which you can possibly succeed. You will have
barren work, to say nothing of incurring some dan-
ger. Let me very strongly advise you to draw off
at once.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is curious,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;but that was the
very advice which I had intended to give you. I
have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the lit-
tle which I have seen of your personality has not
lessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man.
No one wants to rake up your past and make you
unduly uncomfortable. It is over, and you are now
in smooth waters, but if you persist in this mar-
riage you will raise up a swarm of powerful en-
emies who will never leave you alone until they
have made England too hot to hold you. Is the
game worth it? Surely you would be wiser if you
left the lady alone. It would not be pleasant for
you if these facts of your past were brought to her
notice.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under
his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. These
quivered with amusement as he listened, and he
finally broke into a gentle chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;but it is really funny to see you trying to play
a hand with no cards in it. I don&#8217;t think anyone
could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the
same. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, noth-
ing but the smallest of the small.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;So you think.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;So I know. Let me make the thing clear to
you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford
to show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the
entire affection of this lady. This was given to me
in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all
the unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told
her that certain wicked and designing persons&#8212;I
hope you recognize yourself&#8212;would come to her
and tell her these things, and I warned her how
</p>
<p>to treat them. You have heard of post-hypnotic
suggestion, Mr. Holmes? Well, you will see how it
works, for a man of personality can use hypnotism
without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. So she is
ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give
you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to
her father&#8217;s will&#8212;save only in the one little mat-
ter.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to
say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity
as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the
door-handle, he stopped me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;By the way, Mr. Holmes,&#8217; said he, &#8216;did you
know Le Brun, the French agent?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Do you know what befell him?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches
in the Montmartre district and crippled for life.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Quite true, Mr. Holmes. By a curious coinci-
dence he had been inquiring into my affairs only
a week before. Don&#8217;t do it, Mr. Holmes; it&#8217;s not a
lucky thing to do. Several have found that out. My
last word to you is, go your own way and let me
go mine. Good-bye!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So there you are, Watson. You are up to date
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow seems dangerous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty dangerous. I disregard the blusterer,
but this is the sort of man who says rather less than
he means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must you interfere? Does it really matter if he
marries the girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering that he undoubtedly murdered
his last wife, I should say it mattered very much.
Besides, the client! Well, well, we need not discuss
that. When you have finished your coffee you had
best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell
will be there with his report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse,
red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black
eyes which were the only external sign of the very
cunning mind within. It seems that he had dived
down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and
beside him on the settee was a brand which he had
brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young
woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet
so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the ter-
rible years which had left their leprous mark upon
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Miss Kitty Winter,&#8221; said Shinwell John-
son, waving his fat hand as an introduction. &#8220;What
</p>
<p>860</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>she don&#8217;t know&#8212;well, there, she&#8217;ll speak for her-
self. Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within
an hour of your message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m easy to find,&#8221; said the young woman.
&#8220;Hell, London, gets me every time. Same address
for Porky Shinwell. We&#8217;re old mates, Porky, you
and I. But, by cripes! there is another who ought
to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any
justice in the world! That is the man you are after,
Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled. &#8220;I gather we have your good
wishes, Miss Winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can help to put him where he belongs, I&#8217;m
yours to the rattle,&#8221; said our visitor with fierce en-
ergy. There was an intensity of hatred in her white,
set face and her blazing eyes such as woman sel-
dom and man never can attain. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t go
into my past, Mr. Holmes. That&#8217;s neither here nor
there. But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me.
If I could pull him down!&#8221; She clutched franti-
cally with her hands into the air. &#8220;Oh, if I could
only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so
many!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how the matter stands?&#8221;
&#8220;Porky Shinwell has been telling me. He&#8217;s after
</p>
<p>some other poor fool and wants to marry her this
time. You want to stop it. Well, you surely know
enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl
in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not in her senses. She is madly in love.
She has been told all about him. She cares noth-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Told about the murder?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;My Lord, she must have a nerve!&#8221;
&#8220;She puts them all down as slanders.&#8221;
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you lay proofs before her silly eyes?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, can you help us do so?&#8221;
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I a proof myself? If I stood before her
</p>
<p>and told her how he used me&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Would you do this?&#8221;
&#8220;Would I? Would I not!&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it might be worth trying. But he has told
</p>
<p>her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and
I understand she will not reopen the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay he didn&#8217;t tell her all,&#8221; said Miss Win-
ter. &#8220;I caught a glimpse of one or two murders
besides the one that made such a fuss. He would
speak of someone in his velvet way and then look
at me with a steady eye and say: &#8216;He died within
</p>
<p>a month.&#8217; It wasn&#8217;t hot air, either. But I took little
notice&#8212;you see, I loved him myself at that time.
Whatever he did went with me, same as with this
poor fool! There was just one thing that shook
me. Yes, by cripes! if it had not been for his poi-
sonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes, I&#8217;d
have left him that very night. It&#8217;s a book he has&#8212;a
brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in
gold on the outside. I think he was a bit drunk
that night, or he would not have shown it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it, then?&#8221;
&#8220;I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects
</p>
<p>women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some
men collect moths or butterflies. He had it all in
that book. Snapshot photographs, names, details,
everything about them. It was a beastly book&#8212;a
book no man, even if he had come from the gut-
ter, could have put together. But it was Adelbert
Gruner&#8217;s book all the same. &#8216;Souls I have ruined.&#8217;
He could have put that on the outside if he had
been so minded. However, that&#8217;s neither here nor
there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it
would, you can&#8217;t get it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;
&#8220;How can I tell you where it is now? It&#8217;s more
</p>
<p>than a year since I left him. I know where he kept
it then. He&#8217;s a precise, tidy cat of a man in many
of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole
of the old bureau in the inner study. Do you know
his house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in the study,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Have you, though? You haven&#8217;t been slow on
</p>
<p>the job if you only started this morning. Maybe
dear Adelbert has met his match this time. The
outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery
in it&#8212;big glass cupboard between the windows.
Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the
inner study&#8212;a small room where he keeps papers
and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he not afraid of burglars?&#8221;
&#8220;Adelbert is no coward. His worst enemy
</p>
<p>couldn&#8217;t say that of him. He can look after himself.
There&#8217;s a burglar alarm at night. Besides, what is
there for a burglar&#8212;unless they got away with all
this fancy crockery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No good,&#8221; said Shinwell Johnson with the de-
cided voice of the expert. &#8220;No fence wants stuff of
that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Well, now, Miss
Winter, if you would call here to-morrow evening
at five, I would consider in the meanwhile whether
your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may
not be arranged. I am exceedingly obliged to you
</p>
<p>861</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Illustrious Client
</p>
<p>for your cooperation. I need not say that my clients
will consider liberally&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; cried the young
woman. &#8220;I am not out for money. Let me see
this man in the mud, and I&#8217;ve got all I&#8217;ve worked
for&#8212;in the mud with my foot on his cursed face.
That&#8217;s my price. I&#8217;m with you to-morrow or any
other day so long as you are on his track. Porky
here can tell you always where to find me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I did not see Holmes again until the following
evening when we dined once more at our Strand
restaurant. He shrugged his shoulders when I
asked him what luck he had had in his interview.
Then he told the story, which I would repeat in
this way. His hard, dry statement needs some lit-
tle editing to soften it into the terms of real life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no difficulty at all about the ap-
pointment,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;for the girl glories in
showing abject filial obedience in all secondary
things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant
breach of it in her engagement. The General
&#8217;phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W.
turned up according to schedule, so that at half-
past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berke-
ley Square, where the old soldier resides&#8212;one
of those awful gray London castles which would
make a church seem frivolous. A footman showed
us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room,
and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale,
self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow
image on a mountain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know how to make her clear to
you, Watson. Perhaps you may meet her before
we are through, and you can use your own gift
of words. She is beautiful, but with the ethe-
real other-world beauty of some fanatic whose
thoughts are set on high. I have seen such faces
in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle
Ages. How a beastman could have laid his vile
paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot
imagine. You may have noticed how extremes call
to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-
man to the angel. You never saw a worse case than
this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She knew what we had come for, of
course&#8212;that villain had lost no time in poisoning
her mind against us. Miss Winter&#8217;s advent rather
amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our
respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving
two rather leprous mendicants. If your head is in-
clined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of
Miss Violet de Merville.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, sir,&#8217; said she in a voice like the wind
from an iceberg, &#8216;your name is familiar to me. You
</p>
<p>have called, as I understand, to malign my fiance&#180;,
Baron Gruner. It is only by my father&#8217;s request
that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance
that anything you can say could not possibly have
the slightest effect upon my mind.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sorry for her, Watson. I thought of
her for the moment as I would have thought of a
daughter of my own. I am not often eloquent. I use
my head, not my heart. But I really did plead with
her with all the warmth of words that I could find
in my nature. I pictured to her the awful position
of the woman who only wakes to a man&#8217;s charac-
ter after she is his wife&#8212;a woman who has to sub-
mit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous
lips. I spared her nothing&#8212;the shame, the fear,
the agony, the hopelessness of it all. All my hot
words could not bring one tinge of colour to those
ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those ab-
stracted eyes. I thought of what the rascal had said
about a post-hypnotic influence. One could really
believe that she was living above the earth in some
ecstatic dream. Yet there was nothing indefinite in
her replies.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have listened to you with patience, Mr.
Holmes,&#8217; said she. &#8216;The effect upon my mind is
exactly as predicted. I am aware that Adelbert,
that my fiance&#180;, has had a stormy life in which he
has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust asper-
sions. You are only the last of a series who have
brought their slanders before me. Possibly you
mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent
who would have been equally willing to act for the
Baron as against him. But in any case I wish you
to understand once for all that I love him and that
he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world
is no more to me than the twitter of those birds
outside the window. If his noble nature has ever
for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been
specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level.
I am not clear&#8217;&#8212;here she turned eyes upon my
companion&#8212;&#8216;who this young lady may be.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to answer when the girl broke in
like a whirlwind. If ever you saw flame and ice
face to face, it was those two women.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you who I am,&#8217; she cried, springing
out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with pas-
sion&#8212;&#8216;I am his last mistress. I am one of a hun-
dred that he has tempted and used and ruined
and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you
also. Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave,
and maybe that&#8217;s the best. I tell you, you foolish
woman, if you marry this man he&#8217;ll be the death of
you. It may be a broken heart or it may be a bro-
ken neck, but he&#8217;ll have you one way or the other.
It&#8217;s not out of love for you I&#8217;m speaking. I don&#8217;t
</p>
<p>862</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>care a tinker&#8217;s curse whether you live or die. It&#8217;s
out of hate for him and to spite him and to get
back on him for what he did to me. But it&#8217;s all
the same, and you needn&#8217;t look at me like that, my
fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before
you are through with it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I should prefer not to discuss such matters,&#8217;
said Miss de Merville coldly. &#8216;Let me say once for
all that I am aware of three passages in my fiance&#180;&#8217;s
life in which he became entangled with designing
women, and that I am assured of his hearty repen-
tance for any evil that he may have done.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Three passages!&#8217; screamed my companion.
&#8216;You fool! You unutterable fool!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this
interview to an end,&#8217; said the icy voice. &#8216;I have
obeyed my father&#8217;s wish in seeing you, but I am
not compelled to listen to the ravings of this per-
son.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With an oath Miss Winter darted forward,
and if I had not caught her wrist she would have
clutched this maddening woman by the hair. I
dragged her towards the door and was lucky to
get her back into the cab without a public scene,
for she was beside herself with rage. In a cold
way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there
was something indescribably annoying in the calm
aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the
woman whom we were trying to save. So now
once again you know exactly how we stand, and it
is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move,
for this gambit won&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ll keep in touch with
you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you
will have your part to play, though it is just pos-
sible that the next move may lie with them rather
than with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And it did. Their blow fell&#8212;or his blow rather,
for never could I believe that the lady was privy
to it. I think I could show you the very paving-
stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon
the placard, and a pang of horror passed through
my very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and
Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-
vender displayed his evening papers. The date was
just two days after the last conversation. There,
black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet:
</p>
<p>Murderous Attack Upon Sherlock
Holmes
</p>
<p>I think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I
have a confused recollection of snatching at a pa-
per, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had
not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway
of a chemist&#8217;s shop while I turned up the fateful
paragraph. This was how it ran:
</p>
<p>We learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, the well-known private detective,
was the victim this morning of a murder-
ous assault which has left him in a precar-
ious position. There are no exact details to
hand, but the event seems to have occurred
about twelve o&#8217;clock in Regent Street, out-
side the Cafe Royal. The attack was made
by two men armed with sticks, and Mr.
Holmes was beaten about the head and
body, receiving injuries which the doctors
describe as most serious. He was carried
to Charing Cross Hospital and afterwards
insisted upon being taken to his rooms in
Baker Street. The miscreants who attacked
him appear to have been respectably dressed
men, who escaped from the bystanders by
passing through the Cafe Royal and out
into Glasshouse Street behind it. No doubt
they belonged to that criminal fraternity
which has so often had occasion to bewail
the activity and ingenuity of the injured
man.
</p>
<p>I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced
over the paragraph before I had sprung into a han-
som and was on my way to Baker Street. I found
Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall
and his brougham waiting at the curb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No immediate danger,&#8221; was his report. &#8220;Two
lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable
bruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Mor-
phine has been injected and quiet is essential, but
an interview of a few minutes would not be abso-
lutely forbidden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this permission I stole into the darkened
room. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard
my name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-
quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted
through and struck the bandaged head of the in-
jured man. A crimson patch had soaked through
the white linen compress. I sat beside him and
bent my head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Watson. Don&#8217;t look so scared,&#8221; he
muttered in a very weak voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as bad as
it seems.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know.
</p>
<p>I took most of them on my guard. It was the sec-
ond man that was too much for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do, Holmes? Of course, it was that
damned fellow who set them on. I&#8217;ll go and thrash
the hide off him if you give the word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Watson! No, we can do noth-
ing there unless the police lay their hands on
</p>
<p>863</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Illustrious Client
</p>
<p>the men. But their get-away had been well pre-
pared. We may be sure of that. Wait a little.
I have my plans. The first thing is to exagger-
ate my injuries. They&#8217;ll come to you for news.
Put it on thick, Watson. Lucky if I live the week
out&#8212;concussion&#8212;delirium&#8212;what you like! You
can&#8217;t overdo it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Sir Leslie Oakshott?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s all right. He shall see the worst side
of me. I&#8217;ll look after that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out
of the way. Those beauties will be after her now.
They know, of course, that she was with me in the
case. If they dared to do me in it is not likely they
will neglect her. That is urgent. Do it to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go now. Anything more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put my pipe on the table&#8212;and the tobacco-
slipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will
plan our campaign.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I arranged with Johnson that evening to take
Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay
low until the danger was past.
</p>
<p>For six days the public were under the impres-
sion that Holmes was at the door of death. The
bulletins were very grave and there were sinister
paragraphs in the papers. My continual visits as-
sured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry
constitution and his determined will were work-
ing wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had
suspicions at times that he was really finding him-
self faster than he pretended even to me. There
was a curious secretive streak in the man which led
to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest
friend guessing as to what his exact plans might
be. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the
only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was
nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always
conscious of the gap between.
</p>
<p>On the seventh day the stitches were taken out,
in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in
the evening papers. The same evening papers had
an announcement which I was bound, sick or well,
to carry to my friend. It was simply that among the
passengers on the Cunard boat Ruritania, starting
from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert
Gruner, who had some important financial busi-
ness to settle in the States before his impending
wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter
of, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a
cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which
told me that it hit him hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friday!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Only three clear days. I
believe the rascal wants to put himself out of dan-
ger&#8217;s way. But he won&#8217;t, Watson! By the Lord
Harry, he won&#8217;t! Now, Watson, I want you to do
something for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here to be used, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours
</p>
<p>in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.&#8221;
He gave no explanations and I asked for none.
</p>
<p>By long experience I had learned the wisdom of
obedience. But when I had left his room I walked
down Baker Street, revolving in my head how on
earth I was to carry out so strange an order. Fi-
nally I drove to the London Library in St. James&#8217;s
Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the
sublibrarian, and departed to my rooms with a
goodly volume under my arm.
</p>
<p>It is said that the barrister who crams up a case
with such care that he can examine an expert wit-
ness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced
knowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should
not like now to pose as an authority upon ceram-
ics. And yet all that evening, and all that night
with a short interval for rest, and all next morn-
ing, I was sucking in knowledge and committing
names to memory. There I learned of the hall-
marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mys-
tery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu
and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of
Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period
of the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with
all this information when I called upon Holmes
next evening. He was out of bed now, though you
would not have guessed it from the published re-
ports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head
resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite
armchair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Holmes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;if one believed the pa-
pers, you are dying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the very impression which
I intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you
learned your lessons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I have tried to.&#8221;
&#8220;Good. You could keep up an intelligent con-
</p>
<p>versation on the subject?&#8221;
&#8220;I believe I could.&#8221;
&#8220;Then hand me that little box from the mantel-
</p>
<p>piece.&#8221;
He opened the lid and took out a small object
</p>
<p>most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk.
This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little
saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs careful handling, Watson. This is
the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty.
</p>
<p>864</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>No finer piece ever passed through Christie&#8217;s. A
complete set of this would be worth a king&#8217;s ran-
som&#8212;in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set
outside the imperial palace of Peking. The sight of
this would drive a real connoisseur wild.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to do with it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes handed me a card upon which was
printed: &#8220;Dr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your name for the evening, Watson.
You will call upon Baron Gruner. I know some-
thing of his habits, and at half-past eight he would
probably be disengaged. A note will tell him in
advance that you are about to call, and you will
say that you are bringing him a specimen of an
absolutely unique set of Ming china. You may as
well be a medical man, since that is a part which
you can play without duplicity. You are a collec-
tor, this set has come your way, you have heard of
the Baron&#8217;s interest in the subject, and you are not
averse to selling at a price.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What price?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well asked, Watson. You would certainly fall
down badly if you did not know the value of your
own wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir
James, and comes, I understand, from the collec-
tion of his client. You will not exaggerate if you
say that it could hardly be matched in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could perhaps suggest that the set should be
valued by an expert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! You scintillate to-day. Sug-
gest Christie or Sotheby. Your delicacy prevents
your putting a price for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he won&#8217;t see me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will see you. He has the collec-
tion mania in its most acute form&#8212;and especially
on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged
authority. Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the
letter. No answer needed. You will merely say that
you are coming, and why.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an admirable document, short, courte-
ous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the con-
noisseur. A district messenger was duly dis-
patched with it. On the same evening, with the
precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr.
Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own ad-
venture.
</p>
<p>The beautiful house and grounds indicated that
Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of
considerable wealth. A long winding drive, with
banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out
into a great gravelled square adorned with stat-
ues. The place had been built by a South African
</p>
<p>gold king in the days of the great boom, and the
long, low house with the turrets at the corners,
though an architectural nightmare, was imposing
in its size and solidity. A butler, who would have
adorned a bench of bishops, showed me in and
handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ush-
ered me into the Baron&#8217;s presence.
</p>
<p>He was standing at the open front of a great
case which stood between the windows and which
contained part of his Chinese collection. He turned
as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down, Doctor,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I was
looking over my own treasures and wondering
whether I could really afford to add to them. This
little Tang specimen, which dates from the sev-
enth century, would probably interest you. I am
sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer
glaze. Have you the Ming saucer with you of
which you spoke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him.
He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the
lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to
examine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon
his own features, and I was able to study them at
my ease.
</p>
<p>He was certainly a remarkably handsome man.
His European reputation for beauty was fully de-
served. In figure he was not more than of mid-
dle size, but was built upon graceful and active
lines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with
large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily
hold an irresistible fascination for women. His
hair and moustache were raven black, the latter
short, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features
were regular and pleasing, save only his straight,
thin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer&#8217;s
mouth it was there&#8212;a cruel, hard gash in the face,
compressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-
advised to train his moustache away from it, for it
was Nature&#8217;s danger-signal, set as a warning to his
victims. His voice was engaging and his manners
perfect. In age I should have put him at little over
thirty, though his record afterwards showed that
he was forty-two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very fine&#8212;very fine indeed!&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;And you say you have a set of six to correspond.
What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of
such magnificent specimens. I only know of one in
England to match this, and it is certainly not likely
to be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I
were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it really matter?&#8221; I asked with as care-
less an air as I could muster. &#8220;You can see that the

</p>
<p>piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content
to take an expert&#8217;s valuation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very mysterious,&#8221; said he with a quick, suspi-
cious flash of his dark eyes. &#8220;In dealing with ob-
jects of such value, one naturally wishes to know
all about the transaction. That the piece is genuine
is certain. I have no doubts at all about that. But
suppose&#8212;I am bound to take every possibility into
account&#8212;that it should prove afterwards that you
had no right to sell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would guarantee you against any claim of
the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, of course, would open up the question
as to what your guarantee was worth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My bankers would answer that.&#8221;
&#8220;Quite so. And yet the whole transaction
</p>
<p>strikes me as rather unusual.&#8221;
&#8220;You can do business or not,&#8221; said I with indif-
</p>
<p>ference. &#8220;I have given you the first offer as I un-
derstood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall
have no difficulty in other quarters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you I was a connoisseur?&#8221;
&#8220;I was aware that you had written a book upon
</p>
<p>the subject.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you read the book?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me, this becomes more and more diffi-
</p>
<p>cult for me to understand! You are a connoisseur
and collector with a very valuable piece in your
collection, and yet you have never troubled to con-
sult the one book which would have told you of the
real meaning and value of what you held. How do
you explain that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a very busy man. I am a doctor in prac-
tice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is no answer. If a man has a hobby he
follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be.
You said in your note that you were a connois-
seur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am.&#8221;
&#8220;Might I ask you a few questions to test you? I
</p>
<p>am obliged to tell you, Doctor&#8212;if you are indeed a
doctor&#8212;that the incident becomes more and more
suspicious. I would ask you what do you know of
the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him
with the Shoso-in near Nara? Dear me, does that
puzzle you? Tell me a little about the Northern Wei
dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sprang from my chair in simulated anger.
&#8220;This is intolerable, sir,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I came here
</p>
<p>to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if I
</p>
<p>were a schoolboy. My knowledge on these subjects
may be second only to your own, but I certainly
shall not answer questions which have been put in
so offensive a way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at me steadily. The languor had
gone from his eyes. They suddenly glared. There
was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the game? You are here as a spy. You
are an emissary of Holmes. This is a trick that
you are playing upon me. The fellow is dying I
hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me.
You&#8217;ve made your way in here without leave, and,
by God! you may find it harder to get out than to
get in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back,
bracing myself for an attack, for the man was be-
side himself with rage. He may have suspected me
from the first; certainly this cross-examination had
shown him the truth; but it was clear that I could
not hope to deceive him. He dived his hand into a
side-drawer and rummaged furiously. Then some-
thing struck upon his ear, for he stood listening
intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; and dashed into the
room behind him.
</p>
<p>Two steps took me to the open door, and my
mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene
within. The window leading out to the garden was
wide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible
ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face
drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The
next instant he was through the gap, and I heard
the crash of his body among the laurel bushes out-
side. With a howl of rage the master of the house
rushed after him to the open window.
</p>
<p>And then! It was done in an instant, and yet
I clearly saw it. An arm&#8212;a woman&#8217;s arm&#8212;shot
out from among the leaves. At the same instant
the Baron uttered a horrible cry&#8212;a yell which will
always ring in my memory. He clapped his two
hands to his face and rushed round the room, beat-
ing his head horribly against the walls. Then he
fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while
scream after scream resounded through the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Water! For God&#8217;s sake, water!&#8221; was his cry.
I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed
</p>
<p>to his aid. At the same moment the butler and
several footmen ran in from the hall. I remember
that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured
man and turned that awful face to the light of the
lamp. The vitriol was eating into it everywhere
and dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye
was already white and glazed. The other was red
and inflamed. The features which I had admired
</p>
<p>866</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>a few minutes before were now like some beauti-
ful painting over which the artist has passed a wet
and foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured,
inhuman, terrible.
</p>
<p>In a few words I explained exactly what had oc-
curred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned.
Some had climbed through the window and oth-
ers had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark
and it had begun to rain. Between his screams the
victim raged and raved against the avenger. &#8220;It
was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Oh, the
she-devil! She shall pay for it! She shall pay! Oh,
God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on
the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic
of morphia. All suspicion of me had passed from
his mind in the presence of this shock, and he
clung to my hands as if I might have the power
even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed
up at me. I could have wept over the ruin had
I not remembered very clearly the vile life which
had led up to so hideous a change. It was loath-
some to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and
I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely fol-
lowed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my
charge. An inspector of police had also arrived,
and to him I handed my real card. It would have
been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for
I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as
Holmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom
and terror. Within an hour I was at Baker Street.
</p>
<p>Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, look-
ing very pale and exhausted. Apart from his in-
juries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by
the events of the evening, and he listened with hor-
ror to my account of the Baron&#8217;s transformation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wages of sin, Watson&#8212;the wages of sin!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Sooner or later it will always come. God
knows, there was sin enough,&#8221; he added, taking
up a brown volume from the table. &#8220;Here is the
book the woman talked of. If this will not break
off the marriage, nothing ever could. But it will,
Watson. It must. No self-respecting woman could
stand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is his love diary?&#8221;
&#8220;Or his lust diary. Call it what you will. The
</p>
<p>moment the woman told us of it I realized what
a tremendous weapon was there if we could but
lay our hands on it. I said nothing at the time
to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might
have given it away. But I brooded over it. Then
this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting
the Baron think that no precautions need be taken
against me. That was all to the good. I would
</p>
<p>have waited a little longer, but his visit to America
forced my hand. He would
