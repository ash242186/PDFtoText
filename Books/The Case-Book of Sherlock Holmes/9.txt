<p>t is a most singular thing that a prob-
lem which was certainly as abstruse and
unusual as any which I have faced in
my long professional career should have
</p>
<p>come to me after my retirement, and be brought,
as it were, to my very door. It occurred after my
withdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had
given myself up entirely to that soothing life of Na-
ture for which I had so often yearned during the
long years spent amid the gloom of London. At
this period of my life the good Watson had passed
almost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end
visit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I
must act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but
been with me, how much he might have made of
so wonderful a happening and of my eventual tri-
umph against every difficulty! As it is, however,
I must needs tell my tale in my own plain way,
showing by my words each step upon the diffi-
cult road which lay before me as I searched for the
mystery of the Lion&#8217;s Mane.
</p>
<p>My villa is situated upon the southern slope of
the downs, commanding a great view of the Chan-
nel. At this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk
cliffs, which can only be descended by a single,
long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery.
At the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of
pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full.
Here and there, however, there are curves and hol-
lows which make splendid swimming-pools filled
afresh with each flow. This admirable beach ex-
tends for some miles in each direction, save only
at one point where the little cove and village of
Fulworth break the line.
</p>
<p>My house is lonely. I, my old housekeeper,
and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. Half
a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst&#8217;s well-
known coaching establishment, The Gables, quite
a large place, which contains some score of young
fellows preparing for various professions, with a
staff of several masters. Stackhurst himself was
a well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an ex-
cellent all-round scholar. He and I were always
friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he
was the one man who was on such terms with me
that we could drop in on each other in the evenings
without an invitation.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a se-
vere gale, the wind blowing up-channel, heaping
the seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving a la-
goon at the turn of the tide. On the morning of
which I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature
was newly washed and fresh. It was impossible to
work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out
</p>
<p>before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked
along the cliff path which led to the steep descent
to the beach. As I walked I heard a shout behind
me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his
hand in cheery greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I
should see you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going for a swim, I see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At your old tricks again,&#8221; he laughed, patting
his bulging pocket. &#8220;Yes. McPherson started early,
and I expect I may find him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fitzroy McPherson was the science master,
a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had
been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic
fever. He was a natural athlete, however, and ex-
celled in every game which did not throw too great
a strain upon him. Summer and winter he went for
his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have
often joined him.
</p>
<p>At this moment we saw the man himself. His
head showed above the edge of the cliff where the
path ends. Then his whole figure appeared at the
top, staggering like a drunken man. The next in-
stant he threw up his hands and, with a terrible
cry, fell upon his face. Stackhurst and I rushed for-
ward&#8212;it may have been fifty yards&#8212;and turned
him on his back. He was obviously dying. Those
glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks
could mean nothing else. One glimmer of life
came into his face for an instant, and he uttered
two or three words with an eager air of warning.
They were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the
last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips,
were &#8220;the Lion&#8217;s Mane.&#8221; It was utterly irrelevant
and unintelligible, and yet I could twist the sound
into no other sense. Then he half raised himself
from the ground, threw his arms into the air, and
fell forward on his side. He was dead.
</p>
<p>My companion was paralyzed by the sudden
horror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had
every sense on the alert. And I had need, for it
was speedily evident that we were in the presence
of an extraordinary case. The man was dressed
only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an
unlaced pair of canvas shoes. As he fell over, his
Burberry, which had been simply thrown round
his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. We
stared at it in amazement. His back was cov-
ered with dark red lines as though he had been
terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. The in-
strument with which this punishment had been
inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry
weals curved round his shoulders and ribs. There

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Lion&#8217;s Mane
</p>
<p>was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bit-
ten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his
agony. His drawn and distorted face told how ter-
rible that agony had been.
</p>
<p>I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the
body when a shadow fell across us, and we found
that Ian Murdoch was by our side. Murdoch was
the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall,
dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can
be said to have been his friend. He seemed to live
in some high, abstract region of surds and conic
sections, with little to connect him with ordinary
life. He was looked upon as an oddity by the stu-
dents, and would have been their butt, but there
was some strange outlandish blood in the man,
which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes
and swarthy face but also in occasional outbreaks
of temper, which could only be described as fero-
cious. On one occasion, being plagued by a little
dog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the
creature up and hurled it through the plate-glass
window, an action for which Stackhurst would cer-
tainly have given him his dismissal had he not
been a very valuable teacher. Such was the strange
complex man who now appeared beside us. He
seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before
him, though the incident of the dog may show that
there was no great sympathy between the dead
man and himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow! Poor fellow! What can I do?
How can I help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you with him? Can you tell us what has
happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I was late this morning. I was not on
the beach at all. I have come straight from The
Gables. What can I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hurry to the police-station at Ful-
worth. Report the matter at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without a word he made off at top speed, and I
proceeded to take the matter in hand, while Stack-
hurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body.
My first task naturally was to note who was on the
beach. From the top of the path I could see the
whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted
save that two or three dark figures could be seen
far away moving towards the village of Fulworth.
Having satisfied myself upon this point, I walked
slowly down the path. There was clay or soft marl
mixed with the chalk, and every here and there
I saw the same footstep, both ascending and de-
scending. No one else had gone down to the beach
by this track that morning. At one place I ob-
served the print of an open hand with the fingers
towards the incline. This could only mean that
</p>
<p>poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. There
were rounded depressions, too, which suggested
that he had come down upon his knees more than
once. At the bottom of the path was the consider-
able lagoon left by the retreating tide. At the side
of it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his
towel on a rock. It was folded and dry, so that it
would seem that, after all, he had never entered
the water. Once or twice as I hunted round amid
the hard shingle I came on little patches of sand
where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his
naked foot, could be seen. The latter fact proved
that he had made all ready to bathe, though the
towel indicated that he had not actually done so.
</p>
<p>And here was the problem clearly defined&#8212;as
strange a one as had ever confronted me. The
man had not been on the beach more than a quar-
ter of an hour at the most. Stackhurst had fol-
lowed him from The Gables, so there could be no
doubt about that. He had gone to bathe and had
stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. Then he
had suddenly huddled on his clothes again&#8212;they
were all dishevelled and unfastened&#8212;and he had
returned without bathing, or at any rate without
drying himself. And the reason for his change
of purpose had been that he had been scourged
in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until
he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left
with only strength enough to crawl away and to
die. Who had done this barbarous deed? There
were, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base
of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into
them, and there was no place for concealment.
Then, again, there were those distant figures on
the beach. They seemed too far away to have been
connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon
in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay be-
tween him and them, lapping up to the rocks. On
the sea two or three fishing-boats were at no great
distance. Their occupants might be examined at
our leisure. There were several roads for inquiry,
but none which led to any very obvious goal.
</p>
<p>When I at last returned to the body I found
that a little group of wondering folk had gathered
round it. Stackhurst was, of course, still there, and
Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the
village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of
the slow, solid Sussex breed&#8212;a breed which cov-
ers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior.
He listened to everything, took note of all we said,
and finally drew me aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes. This
is a big thing for me to handle, and I&#8217;ll hear of it
from Lewes if I go wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>950</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I advised him to send for his immediate su-
perior, and for a doctor; also to allow nothing to
be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as possi-
ble to be made, until they came. In the meantime
I searched the dead man&#8217;s pockets. There were
his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small fold-
ing card-case. From this projected a slip of pa-
per, which I unfolded and handed to the constable.
There was written on it in a scrawling, feminine
hand:
</p>
<p>I will be there, you may be sure.
Maudie.
</p>
<p>It read like a love affair, an assignation, though
when and where were a blank. The constable re-
placed it in the card-case and returned it with the
other things to the pockets of the Burberry. Then,
as nothing more suggested itself, I walked back
to my house for breakfast, having first arranged
that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly
searched.
</p>
<p>Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell
me that the body had been removed to The Gables,
where the inquest would be held. He brought
with him some serious and definite news. As I ex-
pected, nothing had been found in the small caves
below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in
McPherson&#8217;s desk, and there were several which
showed an intimate correspondence with a certain
Miss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. We had then es-
tablished the identity of the writer of the note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The police have the letters,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I
could not bring them. But there is no doubt that it
was a serious love affair. I see no reason, however,
to connect it with that horrible happening save, in-
deed, that the lady had made an appointment with
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you
were in the habit of using,&#8221; I remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is mere chance,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that several of the
students were not with McPherson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it mere chance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stackhurst knit his brows in thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ian Murdoch held them back,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He
would insist upon some algebraic demonstration
before breakfast. Poor chap, he is dreadfully cut
up about it all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet I gather that they were not friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At one time they were not. But for a year or
more Murdoch has been as near to McPherson as
he ever could be to anyone. He is not of a very
sympathetic disposition by nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand. I seem to remember your
telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage
of a dog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That blew over all right.&#8221;
&#8220;But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, I am sure they were real friends.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, we must explore the matter of the
</p>
<p>girl. Do you know her?&#8221;
&#8220;Everyone knows her. She is the beauty of
</p>
<p>the neighbourhood&#8212;a real beauty, Holmes, who
would draw attention everywhere. I knew that
McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no no-
tion that it had gone so far as these letters would
seem to indicate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is she?&#8221;
&#8220;She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy, who
</p>
<p>owns all the boats and bathing-cots at Fulworth.
He was a fisherman to start with, but is now a
man of some substance. He and his son William
run the business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?&#8221;
&#8220;On what pretext?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, we can easily find a pretext. After all,
</p>
<p>this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outra-
geous way. Some human hand was on the handle
of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which
inflicted the injuries. His circle of acquaintances in
this lonely place was surely limited. Let us follow
it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to
come upon the motive, which in turn should lead
us to the criminal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It would have been a pleasant walk across the
thyme-scented downs had our minds not been poi-
soned by the tragedy we had witnessed. The vil-
lage of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semi-
circle round the bay. Behind the old-fashioned
hamlet several modern houses have been built
upon the rising ground. It was to one of these that
Stackhurst guided me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s The Haven, as Bellamy called it. The
one with the corner tower and slate roof. Not bad
for a man who started with nothing but&#8212; By Jove,
look at that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The garden gate of The Haven had opened and
a man had emerged. There was no mistaking that
tall, angular, straggling figure. It was Ian Mur-
doch, the mathematician. A moment later we con-
fronted him upon the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said Stackhurst. The man nodded,
gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark
eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal
pulled him up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing there?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>951</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Lion&#8217;s Mane
</p>
<p>Murdoch&#8217;s face flushed with anger. &#8220;I am your
subordinate, sir, under your roof. I am not aware
that I owe you any account of my private actions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stackhurst&#8217;s nerves were near the surface after
all he had endured. Otherwise, perhaps, he would
have waited. Now he lost his temper completely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the circumstances your answer is pure im-
pertinence, Mr. Murdoch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your own question might perhaps come un-
der the same heading.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the first time that I have had to
overlook your insubordinate ways. It will certainly
be the last. You will kindly make fresh arrange-
ments for your future as speedily as you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had intended to do so. I have lost to-day the
only person who made The Gables habitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst,
with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. &#8220;Is he
not an impossible, intolerable man?&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>The one thing that impressed itself forcibly
upon my mind was that Mr. Ian Murdoch was
taking the first chance to open a path of escape
from the scene of the crime. Suspicion, vague and
nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in
my mind. Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might
throw some further light upon the matter. Stack-
hurst pulled himself together, and we went for-
ward to the house.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man
with a flaming red beard. He seemed to be in a
very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid
as his hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I do not desire any particulars. My
son here&#8221;&#8212;indicating a powerful young man, with
a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-
room&#8212;&#8220;is of one mind with me that Mr. McPher-
son&#8217;s attentions to Maud were insulting. Yes, sir,
the word &#8216;marriage&#8217; was never mentioned, and yet
there were letters and meetings, and a great deal
more of which neither of us could approve. She
has no mother, and we are her only guardians. We
are determined&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the words were taken from his mouth by
the appearance of the lady herself. There was no
gainsaying that she would have graced any assem-
bly in the world. Who could have imagined that
so rare a flower would grow from such a root and
in such an atmosphere? Women have seldom been
an attraction to me, for my brain has always gov-
erned my heart, but I could not look upon her per-
fect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the
</p>
<p>downlands in her delicate colouring, without real-
izing that no young man would cross her path un-
scathed. Such was the girl who had pushed open
the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in
front of Harold Stackhurst.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know already that Fitzroy is dead,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Do not be afraid to tell me the particulars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This other gentleman of yours let us know the
news,&#8221; explained the father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no reason why my sister should be
brought into the matter,&#8221; growled the younger
man.
</p>
<p>The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him.
&#8220;This is my business, William. Kindly leave me to
manage it in my own way. By all accounts there
has been a crime committed. If I can help to show
who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She listened to a short account from my com-
panion, with a composed concentration which
showed me that she possessed strong character as
well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always
remain in my memory as a most complete and re-
markable woman. It seems that she already knew
me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes. You have
my sympathy and my help, whoever they may
be.&#8221; It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at
her father and brother as she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I value a woman&#8217;s in-
stinct in such matters. You use the word &#8216;they.&#8217;
You think that more than one was concerned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be
aware that he was a brave and a strong man. No
single person could ever have inflicted such an out-
rage upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I have one word with you alone?&#8221;
&#8220;I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the
</p>
<p>matter,&#8221; cried her father angrily.
She looked at me helplessly. &#8220;What can I do?&#8221;
&#8220;The whole world will know the facts
</p>
<p>presently, so there can be no harm if I discuss them
here,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I should have preferred privacy, but
if your father will not allow it he must share the
deliberations.&#8221; Then I spoke of the note which had
been found in the dead man&#8217;s pocket. &#8220;It is sure
to be produced at the inquest. May I ask you to
throw any light upon it that you can?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no reason for mystery,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;We were engaged to be married, and we only kept
it secret because Fitzroy&#8217;s uncle, who is very old
and said to be dying, might have disinherited him
</p>
<p>952</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>if he had married against his wish. There was no
other reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have told us,&#8221; growled Mr. Bellamy.
&#8220;So I would, father, if you had ever shown sym-
</p>
<p>pathy.&#8221;
&#8220;I object to my girl picking up with men out-
</p>
<p>side her own station.&#8221;
&#8220;It was your prejudice against him which pre-
</p>
<p>vented us from telling you. As to this appoint-
ment&#8221;&#8212;she fumbled in her dress and produced a
crumpled note&#8212;&#8220;it was in answer to this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dearest [ran the message]:
The old place on the beach just after
</p>
<p>sunset on Tuesday. It is the only time I
can get away.
</p>
<p>F. M.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet
him to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I turned over the paper. &#8220;This never came by
post. How did you get it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather not answer that question. It has
really nothing to do with the matter which you are
investigating. But anything which bears upon that
I will most freely answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was as good as her word, but there was
nothing which was helpful in our investigation.
She had no reason to think that her fiance had any
hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had
several warm admirers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She blushed and seemed confused.
&#8220;There was a time when I thought he was. But
</p>
<p>that was all changed when he understood the re-
lations between Fitzroy and myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the shadow round this strange man
seemed to me to be taking more definite shape.
His record must be examined. His rooms must
be privately searched. Stackhurst was a willing
collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were
forming. We returned from our visit to The Haven
with the hope that one free end of this tangled
skein was already in our hands.
</p>
<p>A week passed. The inquest had thrown no
light upon the matter and had been adjourned for
further evidence. Stackhurst had made discreet in-
quiry about his subordinate, and there had been
a superficial search of his room, but without re-
sult. Personally, I had gone over the whole ground
again, both physically and mentally, but with no
new conclusions. In all my chronicles the reader
</p>
<p>will find no case which brought me so completely
to the limit of my powers. Even my imagination
could conceive no solution to the mystery. And
then there came the incident of the dog.
</p>
<p>It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first
by that strange wireless by which such people col-
lect the news of the countryside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson&#8217;s
dog,&#8221; said she one evening.
</p>
<p>I do not encourage such conversations, but the
words arrested my attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of Mr. McPherson&#8217;s dog?&#8221;
&#8220;Dead, sir. Died of grief for its master.&#8221;
&#8220;Who told you this?&#8221;
&#8220;Why, sir, everyone is talking of it. It took on
</p>
<p>terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. Then to-
day two of the young gentlemen from The Gables
found it dead&#8212;down on the beach, sir, at the very
place where its master met his end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very place.&#8221; The words stood out clear
in my memory. Some dim perception that the mat-
ter was vital rose in my mind. That the dog should
die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs.
But &#8220;in the very place&#8221;! Why should this lonely
beach be fatal to it? Was it possible that it also had
been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? Was it
possible&#8212;? Yes, the perception was dim, but al-
ready something was building up in my mind. In
a few minutes I was on my way to The Gables,
where I found Stackhurst in his study. At my re-
quest he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two stu-
dents who had found the dog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,&#8221; said
one of them. &#8220;It must have followed the trail of its
dead master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale ter-
rier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. The body
was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the
limbs contorted. There was agony in every line
of it.
</p>
<p>From The Gables I walked down to the
bathing-pool. The sun had sunk and the shadow
of the great cliff lay black across the water, which
glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. The place
was deserted and there was no sign of life save for
two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. In
the fading light I could dimly make out the little
dog&#8217;s spoor upon the sand round the very rock on
which his master&#8217;s towel had been laid. For a long
time I stood in deep meditation while the shad-
ows grew darker around me. My mind was filled
with racing thoughts. You have known what it was
to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there
is some all-important thing for which you search
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Lion&#8217;s Mane
</p>
<p>and which you know is there, though it remains
forever just beyond your reach. That was how I
felt that evening as I stood alone by that place of
death. Then at last I turned and walked slowly
homeward.
</p>
<p>I had just reached the top of the path when it
came to me. Like a flash, I remembered the thing
for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped.
You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that
I hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge
without scientific system, but very available for the
needs of my work. My mind is like a crowded
box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away
therein&#8212;so many that I may well have but a vague
perception of what was there. I had known that
there was something which might bear upon this
matter. It was still vague, but at least I knew how
I could make it clear. It was monstrous, incredible,
and yet it was always a possibility. I would test it
to the full.
</p>
<p>There is a great garret in my little house which
is stuffed with books. It was into this that I
plunged and rummaged for an hour. At the end
of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and
silver volume. Eagerly I turned up the chapter of
which I had a dim remembrance. Yes, it was in-
deed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and
yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if
it might, indeed, be so. It was late when I retired,
with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the
morrow.
</p>
<p>But that work met with an annoying interrup-
tion. I had hardly swallowed my early cup of
tea and was starting for the beach when I had a
call from Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabu-
lary&#8212;a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful
eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your immense experience, sir,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;This is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no
farther. But I am fairly up against it in this McPher-
son case. The question is, shall I make an arrest,
or shall I not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. There is really no one else when you
come to think of it. That&#8217;s the advantage of this
solitude. We narrow it down to a very small com-
pass. If he did not do it, then who did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you against him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had gleaned along the same furrows as I
had. There was Murdoch&#8217;s character and the mys-
tery which seemed to hang round the man. His
furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident
</p>
<p>of the dog. The fact that he had quarrelled with
McPherson in the past, and that there was some
reason to think that he might have resented his at-
tentions to Miss Bellamy. He had all my points,
but no fresh ones, save that Murdoch seemed to be
making every preparation for departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would my position be if I let him slip
away with all this evidence against him?&#8221; The
burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his
mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider,&#8221; I said, &#8220;all the essential gaps in
your case. On the morning of the crime he can
surely prove an alibi. He had been with his schol-
ars till the last moment, and within a few minutes
of McPherson&#8217;s appearance he came upon us from
behind. Then bear in mind the absolute impos-
sibility that he could single-handed have inflicted
this outrage upon a man quite as strong as him-
self. Finally, there is this question of the instru-
ment with which these injuries were inflicted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What could it be but a scourge or flexible
whip of some sort?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you examined the marks?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen them. So has the doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have examined them very carefully with
a lens. They have peculiarities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stepped to my bureau and brought out an en-
larged photograph. &#8220;This is my method in such
cases,&#8221; I explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr.
Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hardly be what I am if I did not. Now
let us consider this weal which extends round the
right shoulder. Do you observe nothing remark-
able?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its in-
tensity. There is a dot of extravasated blood here,
and another there. There are similar indications in
this other weal down here. What can that mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea. Have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t. I may be
able to say more soon. Anything which will define
what made that mark will bring us a long way to-
wards the criminal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, of course, an absurd idea,&#8221; said the po-
liceman, &#8220;but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid
across the back, then these better marked points
would represent where the meshes crossed each
other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>954</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;A most ingenious comparison. Or shall we
say a very stiff cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails with small hard
knots upon it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.&#8221;
&#8220;Or there may be some very different cause,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bardle. But your case is far too weak for an
arrest. Besides, we have those last words&#8212;the
&#8216;Lion&#8217;s Mane.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have wondered whether Ian&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I have considered that. If the second word
</p>
<p>had borne any resemblance to Murdoch&#8212;but it
did not. He gave it almost in a shriek. I am sure
that it was &#8216;Mane.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps I have. But I do not care to discuss it
</p>
<p>until there is something more solid to discuss.&#8221;
&#8220;And when will that be?&#8221;
&#8220;In an hour&#8212;possibly less.&#8221;
The inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me
</p>
<p>with dubious eyes.
&#8220;I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr.
</p>
<p>Holmes. Perhaps it&#8217;s those fishing-boats.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, they were too far out.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of
</p>
<p>his? They were not too sweet upon Mr. McPher-
son. Could they have done him a mischief?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, you won&#8217;t draw me until I am ready,&#8221;
said I with a smile. &#8220;Now, Inspector, we each have
our own work to do. Perhaps if you were to meet
me here at midday&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>So far we had got when there came the tremen-
dous interruption which was the beginning of the
end.
</p>
<p>My outer door was flung open, there were
blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Mur-
doch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled,
his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his
bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect.
&#8220;Brandy! Brandy!&#8221; he gasped, and fell groaning
upon the sofa.
</p>
<p>He was not alone. Behind him came Stack-
hurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, brandy!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The man is at his
last gasp. It was all I could do to bring him here.
He fainted twice upon the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about
a wondrous change. He pushed himself up on one
arm and swung his coat from his shoulders. &#8220;For
God&#8217;s sake, oil, opium, morphia!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Any-
thing to ease this infernal agony!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector and I cried out at the sight.
There, crisscrossed upon the man&#8217;s naked shoul-
der, was the same strange reticulated pattern of
red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark
of Fitzroy McPherson.
</p>
<p>The pain was evidently terrible and was more
than local, for the sufferer&#8217;s breathing would stop
for a time, his face would turn black, and then with
loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart,
while his brow dropped beads of sweat. At any
moment he might die. More and more brandy was
poured down his throat, each fresh dose bring-
ing him back to life. Pads of cotton-wool soaked
in salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the
strange wounds. At last his head fell heavily upon
the cushion. Exhausted Nature had taken refuge
in its last storehouse of vitality. It was half a sleep
and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain.
</p>
<p>To question him had been impossible, but the
moment we were assured of his condition Stack-
hurst turned upon me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what is it, Holmes? What
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find him?&#8221;
&#8220;Down on the beach. Exactly where poor
</p>
<p>McPherson met his end. If this man&#8217;s heart had
been weak as McPherson&#8217;s was, he would not be
here now. More than once I thought he was gone
as I brought him up. It was too far to The Gables,
so I made for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see him on the beach?&#8221;
&#8220;I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry.
</p>
<p>He was at the edge of the water, reeling about like
a drunken man. I ran down, threw some clothes
about him, and brought him up. For heaven&#8217;s sake,
Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no
pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is
becoming unendurable. Can you, with all your
world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can, Stackhurst. Come with me now!
And you, Inspector, come along! We will see if we
cannot deliver this murderer into your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of
my housekeeper, we all three went down to the
deadly lagoon. On the shingle there was piled a
little heap of towels and clothes left by the stricken
man. Slowly I walked round the edge of the wa-
ter, my comrades in Indian file behind me. Most
of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff
where the beach was hollowed out it was four or
five feet deep. It was to this part that a swim-
mer would naturally go, for it formed a beauti-
ful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. A line
of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Lion&#8217;s Mane
</p>
<p>along this I led the way, peering eagerly into the
depths beneath me. I had reached the deepest and
stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which
they were searching, and I burst into a shout of
triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyanea!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Cyanea! Behold the Lion&#8217;s
Mane!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The strange object at which I pointed did in-
deed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane
of a lion. It lay upon a rocky shelf some three
feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating,
hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yel-
low tresses. It pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation
and contraction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has done mischief enough. Its day is over!&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;Help me, Stackhurst! Let us end the mur-
derer forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a big boulder just above the ledge,
and we pushed it until it fell with a tremen-
dous splash into the water. When the ripples had
cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge
below. One flapping edge of yellow membrane
showed that our victim was beneath it. A thick oily
scum oozed out from below the stone and stained
the water round, rising slowly to the surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this gets me!&#8221; cried the inspector. &#8220;What
was it, Mr. Holmes? I&#8217;m born and bred in these
parts, but I never saw such a thing. It don&#8217;t belong
to Sussex.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as well for Sussex,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;It may
have been the southwest gale that brought it up.
Come back to my house, both of you, and I will
give you the terrible experience of one who has
good reason to remember his own meeting with
the same peril of the seas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we reached my study we found that
Murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit
up. He was dazed in mind, and every now and
then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. In broken
words he explained that he had no notion what
had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had
suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken
all his fortitude to reach the bank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a book,&#8221; I said, taking up the little vol-
ume, &#8220;which first brought light into what might
have been forever dark. It is Out of Doors, by
the famous observer, J. G. Wood. Wood himself
very nearly perished from contact with this vile
creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge.
Cyanea capillata is the miscreant&#8217;s full name, and he
can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful
than, the bite of the cobra. Let me briefly give this
extract.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the bather should see a loose roundish
mass of tawny membranes and fibres, some-
thing like very large handfuls of lion&#8217;s mane
and silver paper, let him beware, for this is
the fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata.
</p>
<p>Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly
described?
</p>
<p>&#8220;He goes on to tell of his own encounter with
one when swimming off the coast of Kent. He
found that the creature radiated almost invisible
filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that
anyone within that circumference from the deadly
centre was in da
