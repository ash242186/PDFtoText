<p>t was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find
himself once more in the untidy room
of the first floor in Baker Street which
had been the starting-point of so many
</p>
<p>remarkable adventures. He looked round him at
the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred
bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the
corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the
pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round
to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young
but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a
little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation
which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great
detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don&#8217;t
change, either. I hope the same can be said of
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed
door of the bedroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s in bed and asleep,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>It was seven in the evening of a lovely sum-
mer&#8217;s day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar
with the irregularity of his old friend&#8217;s hours to
feel no surprise at the idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means a case, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I&#8217;m
frightened for his health. He gets paler and thin-
ner, and he eats nothing. &#8216;When will you be
pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?&#8217; Mrs. Hudson asked.
&#8216;Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,&#8217; said he.
You know his way when he is keen on a case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy, I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s following someone. Yesterday he was
out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he
was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and
I ought to know his ways by now.&#8221; Billy pointed
with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned
against the sofa. &#8220;That&#8217;s part of the old woman&#8217;s
outfit,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it all about, Billy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great
secrets of State. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you, sir, but
it should go no farther. It&#8217;s this case of the Crown
diamond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8212;the hundred-thousand-pound bur-
glary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we
had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary
both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was
very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease
and promised he would do all he could. Then
there is Lord Cantlemere&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, you know what that means. He&#8217;s a
</p>
<p>stiff &#8217;un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with
the Prime Minister, and I&#8217;ve nothing against the
Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort
of man, but I can&#8217;t stand his Lordship. Neither can
Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don&#8217;t believe in Mr.
Holmes and he was against employing him. He&#8217;d
rather he failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Holmes knows it?&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is
</p>
<p>to know.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll hope he won&#8217;t fail and that Lord
</p>
<p>Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy,
what is that curtain for across the window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days
ago. We&#8217;ve got something funny behind it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy advanced and drew away the drapery
which screened the alcove of the bow window.
</p>
<p>Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amaze-
ment. There was a facsimile of his old friend,
dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-
quarters towards the window and downward, as
though reading an invisible book, while the body
was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the
head and held it in the air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We put it at different angles, so that it may
seem more lifelike. I wouldn&#8217;t dare touch it if the
blind were not down. But when it&#8217;s up you can see
this from across the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We used something of the sort once before.&#8221;
&#8220;Before my time,&#8221; said Billy. He drew the win-
</p>
<p>dow curtains apart and looked out into the street.
&#8220;There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I
can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look
for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Watson had taken a step forward when the
bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of
Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his
step and bearing as active as ever. With a single
spring he was at the window, and had drawn the
blind once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, Billy,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You were in dan-
ger of your life then, my boy, and I can&#8217;t do with-
out you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see
you in your old quarters once again. You come at
a critical moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I gather.&#8221;
&#8220;You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Wat-
</p>
<p>son. How far am I justified in allowing him to be
in danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Danger of what, Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>883</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of sudden death. I&#8217;m expecting something
this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Expecting what?&#8221;
&#8220;To be murdered, Watson.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, you are joking, Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;Even my limited sense of humour could
</p>
<p>evolve a better joke than that. But we may be com-
fortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol
permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old
place. Let me see you once more in the customary
armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise
my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take
the place of food these days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not eat?&#8221;
&#8220;Because the faculties become refined when
</p>
<p>you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear
Watson, you must admit that what your digestion
gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to
the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is
a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must
consider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this danger, Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would
</p>
<p>perhaps be as well that you should burden your
memory with the name and address of the mur-
derer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with
my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the
name&#8212;Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down,
man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N.
W. Got it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Watson&#8217;s honest face was twitching with anx-
iety. He knew only too well the immense risks
taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he
said was more likely to be under-statement than
exaggeration. Watson was always the man of ac-
tion, and he rose to the occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do
for a day or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your morals don&#8217;t improve, Watson. You have
added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every
sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him
every hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not such important ones. But can&#8217;t you have
this fellow arrested?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Watson, I could. That&#8217;s what worries him
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t know where the diamond is.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! Billy told me&#8212;the missing Crown jewel!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I&#8217;ve cast
</p>
<p>my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the
</p>
<p>stone. What is the use of taking them? We can
make the world a better place by laying them by
the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It&#8217;s the
stone I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;s a shark. He bites. The other is
Sam Merton, the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but
the Count has used him. Sam&#8217;s not a shark. He
is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is
flopping about in my net all the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is this Count Sylvius?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been at his very elbow all the morning.
You&#8217;ve seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never
more convincing. He actually picked up my para-
sol for me once. &#8216;By your leave, madame,&#8217; said
he&#8212;half-Italian, you know, and with the Southern
graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil
incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whim-
sical happenings, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been tragedy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps it might. I followed him
to old Straubenzee&#8217;s workshop in the Minories.
Straubenzee made the air-gun&#8212;a very pretty bit
of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in
the opposite window at the present moment. Have
you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to
you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful
head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy had reappeared in the room with a
card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised
eyebrows and an amused smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man himself. I had hardly expected this.
Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possi-
bly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter
of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant end-
ing to his excellent sporting record if he added me
to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very
close behind his heel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send for the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you
glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and
see if anyone is hanging about in the street?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Watson looked warily round the edge of the
curtain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be Sam Merton&#8212;the faithful but
rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman,
Billy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the waiting-room, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show him up when I ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>884</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;If I am not in the room, show him in all the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Watson waited until the door was closed, and
then he turned earnestly to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible.
This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He
may have come to murder you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not be surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist upon staying with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be horribly in the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In his way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear fellow&#8212;in my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t possibly leave you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you
have never failed to play the game. I am sure
you will play it to the end. This man has come
for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.&#8221;
Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few
lines. &#8220;Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to
Youghal of the C. I. D. Come back with the police.
The fellow&#8217;s arrest will follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that with joy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you return I may have just time enough
to find out where the stone is.&#8221; He touched the
bell. &#8220;I think we will go out through the bedroom.
This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather
want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I
have, as you will remember, my own way of doing
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, therefore, an empty room into which
Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius.
The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-
about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a
formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-
lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved
nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well
dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and
glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As
the door closed behind him he looked round him
with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a
trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start
as he saw the impassive head and the collar of
the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-
chair in the window. At first his expression was
one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horri-
ble hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He
took one more glance round to see that there were
no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick
half raised, he approached the silent figure. He
was crouching for his final spring and blow when
</p>
<p>a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open
bedroom door:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t break it, Count! Don&#8217;t break it!&#8221;
The assassin staggered back, amazement in his
</p>
<p>convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his
loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his
violence from the effigy to the original; but there
was something in that steady gray eye and mock-
ing smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty little thing,&#8221; said Holmes, ad-
vancing towards the image. &#8220;Tavernier, the French
modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as
your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?&#8221;
&#8220;Put your hat and stick on the side-table.
</p>
<p>Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to
put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you
prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most op-
portune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes&#8217;
chat with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening
eyebrows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, too, wished to have some words with you,
Holmes. That is why I am here. I won&#8217;t deny that
I intended to assault you just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.
&#8220;I rather gathered that you had some idea of
</p>
<p>the sort in your head,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But why these
personal attentions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have gone out of your way to an-
noy me. Because you have put your creatures upon
my track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My creatures! I assure you no!&#8221;
&#8220;Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can
</p>
<p>play at that game, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps
</p>
<p>you would kindly give me my prefix when you
address me. You can understand that, with my
routine of work, I should find myself on familiar
terms with half the rogues&#8217; gallery, and you will
agree that exceptions are invidious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, then.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken
</p>
<p>about my alleged agents.&#8221;
Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.
&#8220;Other people can observe as well as you. Yes-
</p>
<p>terday there was an old sporting man. To-day it
was an elderly woman. They held me in view all
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron
Dowson said the night before he was hanged that
in my case what the law had gained the stage had
</p>
<p>885</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone
</p>
<p>lost. And now you give my little impersonations
your kindly praise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you&#8212;you yourself?&#8221;
Holmes shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;You can see
</p>
<p>in the corner the parasol which you so politely
handed to me in the Minories before you began
to suspect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had known, you might never&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Have seen this humble home again. I was well
</p>
<p>aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to
deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here
we are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count&#8217;s knotted brows gathered more
heavily over his menacing eyes. &#8220;What you say
only makes the matter worse. It was not your
agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You
admit that you have dogged me. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in
Algeria.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
&#8220;But why?&#8221;
&#8220;Why? The sport&#8212;the excitement&#8212;the dan-
</p>
<p>ger!&#8221;
&#8220;And, no doubt, to free the country from a
</p>
<p>pest?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;
&#8220;My reasons in a nutshell!&#8221;
The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand in-
</p>
<p>voluntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.
&#8220;Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another,
</p>
<p>more practical, reason. I want that yellow dia-
mond!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word!&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You knew that I was after you for that. The
</p>
<p>real reason why you are here to-night is to find out
how much I know about the matter and how far
my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should
say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely
essential, for I know all about it, save only one
thing, which you are about to tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing
fact?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the Crown diamond now is.&#8221;
The Count looked sharply at his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the
devil should I be able to tell you where it is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, and you will.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t bluff me, Count Sylvius.&#8221; Holmes&#8217;s
eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened
until they were like two menacing points of steel.
&#8220;You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back
of your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, of course, you see where the diamond
is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes clapped his hands with amusement,
and then pointed a derisive finger. &#8220;Then you do
know. You have admitted it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can
</p>
<p>do business. If not, you will get hurt.&#8221;
Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you talk about bluff!&#8221; said he.
Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a mas-
</p>
<p>ter chess-player who meditates his crowning move.
Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out
a squat notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I keep in this book?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir, I do not!&#8221;
&#8220;You!&#8221;
&#8220;Me!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, you! You are all here&#8212;every action of
</p>
<p>your vile and dangerous life.&#8221;
&#8220;Damn you, Holmes!&#8221; cried the Count with
</p>
<p>blazing eyes. &#8220;There are limits to my patience!&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s all here, Count. The real facts as to the
</p>
<p>death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer
estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are dreaming!&#8221;
&#8220;And the complete life history of Miss Minnie
</p>
<p>Warrender.&#8221;
&#8220;Tut! You will make nothing of that!&#8221;
&#8220;Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery
</p>
<p>in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13,
1892. Here is the forged check in the same year on
the Credit Lyonnais.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you&#8217;re wrong there.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I am right on the others! Now, Count,
</p>
<p>you are a card-player. When the other fellow has
all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your
hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has all this talk to do with the jewel of
which you spoke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let
me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion.
I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a
clear case against both you and your fighting bully
in the case of the Crown diamond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>886</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall
and the cabman who brought you away. I have the
commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have

</p>
<p>The veins stood out on the Count&#8217;s forehead.
His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convul-
sion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but
the words would not shape themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hand I play from,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I
put it all upon the table. But one card is missing.
It&#8217;s the king of diamonds. I don&#8217;t know where the
stone is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never shall know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the
situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty
years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going
to get out of your diamond? None in the world.
But if you hand it over&#8212;well, I&#8217;ll compound a
felony. We don&#8217;t want you or Sam. We want the
stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned
you can go free so long as you behave yourself in
the future. If you make another slip&#8212;well, it will
be the last. But this time my commission is to get
the stone, not you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I refuse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, then&#8212;alas!&#8212;it must be you and not the
stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Count, that it would be as well to have
your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his
interests should be represented. Billy, you will see
a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door.
Ask him to come up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he won&#8217;t come, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No violence, Billy. Don&#8217;t be rough with him.
If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he
will certainly come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; asked the
Count as Billy disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend Watson was with me just now. I
told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my
net; now I am drawing the net and up they come
together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count had risen from his chair, and his
hand was behind his back. Holmes held some-
thing half protruding from the pocket of his
dressing-gown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t die in your bed, Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often had the same idea. Does it mat-
ter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is
</p>
<p>more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal.
But these anticipations of the future are morbid.
Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained en-
joyment of the present?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the
dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal.
Holmes&#8217;s figure seemed to grow taller as he grew
tense and ready.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no use your fingering your revolver, my
friend,&#8221; he said in a quiet voice. &#8220;You know per-
fectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave
you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers,
Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear
the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good
day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man
with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood
awkwardly at the door, looking about him with
a puzzled expression. Holmes&#8217;s debonair manner
was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt
that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter
it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game now, Count? What&#8217;s this fel-
low want? What&#8217;s up?&#8221; His voice was deep and
raucous.
</p>
<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was
Holmes who answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I
should say it was all up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boxer still addressed his remarks to his as-
sociate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I&#8217;m
not in the funny mood myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I expect not,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I think I
can promise you that you will feel even less hu-
morous as the evening advances. Now, look here,
Count Sylvius. I&#8217;m a busy man and I can&#8217;t waste
time. I&#8217;m going into that bedroom. Pray make
yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can
explain to your friend how the matter lies without
the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the
Hoffman &#8216;Barcarole&#8217; upon my violin. In five min-
utes I shall return for your final answer. You quite
grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take
you, or shall we have the stone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from
the corner as he passed. A few moments later the
long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting
of tunes came faintly through the closed door of
the bedroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221; asked Merton anxiously as
his companion turned to him. &#8220;Does he know
about the stone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>887</p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows a damned sight too much about it.
I&#8217;m not sure that he doesn&#8217;t know all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; The boxer&#8217;s sallow face turned a
shade whiter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ikey Sanders has split on us.&#8221;
&#8220;He has, has he? I&#8217;ll do him down a thick &#8217;un
</p>
<p>for that if I swing for it.&#8221;
&#8220;That won&#8217;t help us much. We&#8217;ve got to make
</p>
<p>up our minds what to do.&#8221;
&#8220;Half a mo&#8217;,&#8221; said the boxer, looking suspi-
</p>
<p>ciously at the bedroom door. &#8220;He&#8217;s a leary cove
that wants watching. I suppose he&#8217;s not listening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he be listening with that music go-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Maybe somebody&#8217;s behind a cur-
tain. Too many curtains in this room.&#8221; As he
looked round he suddenly saw for the first time
the effigy in the window, and stood staring and
pointing, too amazed for words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! it&#8217;s only a dummy,&#8221; said the Count.
&#8220;A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tus-
</p>
<p>saud ain&#8217;t in it. It&#8217;s the living spit of him, gown
and all. But them curtains, Count!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting
our time, and there is none too much. He can lag
us over this stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The deuce he can!&#8221;
&#8220;But he&#8217;ll let us slip if we only tell him where
</p>
<p>the swag is.&#8221;
&#8220;What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand quid?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s one or the other.&#8221;
Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.
&#8220;He&#8217;s alone in there. Let&#8217;s do him in. If his
</p>
<p>light were out we should have nothing to fear.&#8221;
The Count shook his head.
&#8220;He is armed and ready. If we shot him we
</p>
<p>could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides,
it&#8217;s likely enough that the police know whatever
evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a vague sound which seemed to
come from the window. Both men sprang round,
but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure
seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something in the street,&#8221; said Merton. &#8220;Now
look here, guv&#8217;nor, you&#8217;ve got the brains. Surely
you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use
then it&#8217;s up to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fooled better men than he,&#8221; the Count an-
swered. &#8220;The stone is here in my secret pocket. I
</p>
<p>take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of
England to-night and cut into four pieces in Ams-
terdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van
Seddar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Van Seddar was going next week.&#8221;
&#8220;He was. But now he must get off by the next
</p>
<p>boat. One or other of us must slip round with the
stone to Lime Street and tell him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the false bottom ain&#8217;t ready.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, he must take it as it is and chance it.
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a moment to lose.&#8221; Again, with the
sense of danger which becomes an instinct with
the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the
window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the
faint sound had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As to Holmes,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;we can fool
him easily enough. You see, the damned fool
won&#8217;t arrest us if he can get the stone. Well,
we&#8217;ll promise him the stone. We&#8217;ll put him on the
wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is
the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out
of the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds good to me!&#8221; cried Sam Merton
with a grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a
move on him. I&#8217;ll see this sucker and fill him up
with a bogus confession. I&#8217;ll tell him that the stone
is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it
gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn&#8217;t
in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the
blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that
keyhole. Here is the stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder you dare carry it.&#8221;
&#8220;Where could I have it safer? If we could take
</p>
<p>it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take
it out of my lodgings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at it.&#8221;
Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering
</p>
<p>glance at his associate and disregarded the un-
washed hand which was extended towards him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8212;d&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m going to snatch it off
you? See here, mister, I&#8217;m getting a bit tired of
your ways.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can&#8217;t afford to
quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to
see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light!
Here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;
With a single spring Holmes had leaped from
</p>
<p>the dummy&#8217;s chair and had grasped the precious
jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other
pointed a revolver at the Count&#8217;s head. The two
</p>
<p>888</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>villains staggered back in utter amazement. Be-
fore they had recovered Holmes had pressed the
electric bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No violence, gentlemen&#8212;no violence, I beg of
you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear
to you that your position is an impossible one. The
police are waiting below.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count&#8217;s bewilderment overmastered his
rage and fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how the deuce&#8212;?&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Your surprise is very natural. You are not
</p>
<p>aware that a second door from my bedroom leads
behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have
heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck
was on my side. It gave me a chance of listen-
ing to your racy conversation which would have
been painfully constrained had you been aware of
my presence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count gave a gesture of resignation.
&#8220;We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are
</p>
<p>the devil himself.&#8221;
&#8220;Not far from him, at any rate,&#8221; Holmes an-
</p>
<p>swered with a polite smile.
Sam Merton&#8217;s slow intellect had only gradually
</p>
<p>appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of
heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke
silence at last.
