<p>he ideas of my friend Watson, though
limited, are exceedingly pertinacious.
For a long time he has worried me to
write an experience of my own. Perhaps
</p>
<p>I have rather invited this persecution, since I have
often had occasion to point out to him how su-
perficial are his own accounts and to accuse him
of pandering to popular taste instead of confining
himself rigidly to facts and figures. &#8220;Try it your-
self, Holmes!&#8221; he has retorted, and I am compelled
to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I
do begin to realize that the matter must be pre-
sented in such a way as may interest the reader.
The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it
is among the strangest happenings in my collec-
tion, though it chanced that Watson had no note
of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend
and biographer, I would take this opportunity to
remark that if I burden myself with a compan-
ion in my various little inquiries it is not done
out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson
has some remarkable characteristics of his own to
which in his modesty he has given small attention
amid his exaggerated estimates of my own perfor-
mances. A confederate who foresees your conclu-
sions and course of action is always dangerous, but
one to whom each development comes as a perpet-
ual surprise, and to whom the future is always a
closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate.
</p>
<p>I find from my notebook that it was in January,
1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that
I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big,
fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good
Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife,
the only selfish action which I can recall in our as-
sociation. I was alone.
</p>
<p>It is my habit to sit with my back to the win-
dow and to place my visitors in the opposite chair,
where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M.
Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the
interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his si-
lence gave me more time for observation. I have
found it wise to impress clients with a sense of
power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From South Africa, sir, I perceive.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he answered, with some surprise.
&#8220;Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;Middlesex Corps, no doubt.&#8221;
&#8220;That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.&#8221;
I smiled at his bewildered expression.
&#8220;When a gentleman of virile appearance enters
</p>
<p>my room with such tan upon his face as an English
</p>
<p>sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in
his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult
to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows
that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a
riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has al-
ready shown me that you are a stockbroker from
Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would
you join?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see everything.&#8221;
&#8220;I see no more than you, but I have trained my-
</p>
<p>self to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it
was not to discuss the science of observation that
you called upon me this morning. What has been
happening at Tuxbury Old Park?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes&#8212;!&#8221;
&#8220;My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter
</p>
<p>came with that heading, and as you fixed this ap-
pointment in very pressing terms it was clear that
something sudden and important had occurred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the
afternoon, and a good deal has happened since
then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me
out&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kicked you out!&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that was what it amounted to. He is
</p>
<p>a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest
martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day
of rough language, too. I couldn&#8217;t have stuck the
colonel if it had not been for Godfrey&#8217;s sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.
&#8220;Perhaps you will explain what you are talking
</p>
<p>about.&#8221;
My client grinned mischievously.
&#8220;I had got into the way of supposing that you
</p>
<p>knew everything without being told,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God
that you will be able to tell me what they mean.
I&#8217;ve been awake all night puzzling my brain, and
the more I think the more incredible does it be-
come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I joined up in January, 1901&#8212;just two
years ago&#8212;young Godfrey Emsworth had joined
the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth&#8217;s
only son&#8212;Emsworth, the Crimean V. C.&#8212;and he
had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he
volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regi-
ment. We formed a friendship&#8212;the sort of friend-
ship which can only be made when one lives the
same life and shares the same joys and sorrows.
He was my mate&#8212;and that means a good deal in
the Army. We took the rough and the smooth to-
gether for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit
with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action
</p>
<p>871</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Blanched Soldier
</p>
<p>near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one let-
ter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from
Southampton. Since then not a word&#8212;not one
word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and
he my closest pal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when the war was over, and we all got
back, I wrote to his father and asked where God-
frey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I
wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and
gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the
world, and it was not likely that he would be back
for a year. That was all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole
thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was
a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that.
It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to
know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also
that his father and he did not always hit it off too
well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and
young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No,
I wasn&#8217;t satisfied, and I determined that I would
get to the root of the matter. It happened, however,
that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening
out, after two years&#8217; absence, and so it is only this
week that I have been able to take up Godfrey&#8217;s
case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to
drop everything in order to see it through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of
person whom it would be better to have as a friend
than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his
square jaw had set hard as he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what have you done?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;My first move was to get down to his home,
</p>
<p>Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for
myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother,
therefore&#8212;I had had quite enough of the curmud-
geon of a father&#8212;and I made a clean frontal attack:
Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of inter-
est which I might tell her of our common expe-
riences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would
there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had
quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to
put me up for the night. That was what took me
down on Monday.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible&#8212;five miles
from anywhere. There was no trap at the station,
so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was
nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wan-
dering house, standing in a considerable park. I
should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles,
starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation
and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was
all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pic-
tures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was
</p>
<p>a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same
age as the house, and there was his wife, who
might have been older. She had been Godfrey&#8217;s
nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as sec-
ond only to his mother in his affections, so I was
drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The
mother I liked also&#8212;a gentle little white mouse of
a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I
barred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a bit of barney right away, and I
should have walked back to the station if I had
not felt that it might be playing his game for me
to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and
there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with
a smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated
behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted
out like a vulture&#8217;s beak, and two fierce gray eyes
glared at me from under tufted brows. I could un-
derstand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, sir,&#8217; said he in a rasping voice, &#8216;I should
be interested to know the real reasons for this
visit.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I answered that I had explained them in my
letter to his wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes, yes, you said that you had known God-
frey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word
for that.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have his letters to me in my pocket.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Kindly let me see them.&#8217;
&#8220;He glanced at the two which I handed him,
</p>
<p>and then he tossed them back.
&#8220; &#8216;Well, what then?&#8217; he asked.
&#8220; &#8216;I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many
</p>
<p>ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that
I should wonder at his sudden silence and should
wish to know what has become of him?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have some recollections, sir, that I had al-
ready corresponded with you and had told you
what had become of him. He has gone upon a
voyage round the world. His health was in a poor
way after his African experiences, and both his
mother and I were of opinion that complete rest
and change were needed. Kindly pass that expla-
nation on to any other friends who may be inter-
ested in the matter.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Certainly,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;But perhaps you
would have the goodness to let me have the name
of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed,
together with the date. I have no doubt that I
should be able to get a letter through to him.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My request seemed both to puzzle and to irri-
tate my host. His great eyebrows came down over
</p>
<p>872</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on
the table. He looked up at last with the expression
of one who has seen his adversary make a danger-
ous move at chess, and has decided how to meet
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Many people, Mr. Dodd,&#8217; said he, &#8216;would
take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would
think that this insistence had reached the point of
damned impertinence.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You must put it down, sir, to my real love for
your son.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Exactly. I have already made every allowance
upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop
these inquiries. Every family has its own inner
knowledge and its own motives, which cannot al-
ways be made clear to outsiders, however well-
intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something
of Godfrey&#8217;s past which you are in a position to tell
her, but I would ask you to let the present and the
future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful pur-
pose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult
position.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There
was no getting past it. I could only pretend to ac-
cept the situation and register a vow inwardly that
I would never rest until my friend&#8217;s fate had been
cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined qui-
etly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room.
The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but
the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was
so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an
excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to
my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the
ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house,
but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr.
Holmes, one is not too particular about one&#8217;s quar-
ters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the
garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a
bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roar-
ing fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and
endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I
was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler,
who came in with a fresh supply of coals.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I thought you might run short in the night-
time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are
cold.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He hesitated before leaving the room, and
when I looked round he was standing facing me
with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help
hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey
at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him,
and so I may say I am his foster-father. It&#8217;s natural
</p>
<p>we should take an interest. And you say he carried
himself well, sir?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There was no braver man in the regiment. He
pulled me out once from under the rifles of the
Boers, or maybe I should not be here.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.
&#8220; &#8216;Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over.
</p>
<p>He was always courageous. There&#8217;s not a tree in
the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing
would stop him. He was a fine boy&#8212;and oh, sir,
he was a fine man.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sprang to my feet.
&#8220; &#8216;Look here!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;You say he was. You
</p>
<p>speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery?
What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he
shrank away.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what you mean, sir. Ask the
master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not
for me to interfere.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was leaving the room, but I held his arm.
&#8220; &#8216;Listen,&#8217; I said. &#8216;You are going to answer one
</p>
<p>question before you leave if I have to hold you all
night. Is Godfrey dead?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He could not face my eyes. He was like a
man hypnotized. The answer was dragged from
his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I wish to God he was!&#8217; he cried, and, tearing
himself free, he dashed from the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to
my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old
man&#8217;s words seemed to me to bear only one in-
terpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become
involved in some criminal or, at the least, disrep-
utable transaction which touched the family hon-
our. That stern old man had sent his son away
and hidden him from the world lest some scan-
dal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless
fellow. He was easily influenced by those around
him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and
been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business,
if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty
to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was
anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up,
and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My client had paused as one in deep emotion.
&#8220;Pray continue,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Your problem
</p>
<p>presents some very unusual features.&#8221;
&#8220;He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with
</p>
<p>his face pressed against the glass. I have told
you that I looked out at the night. When I did
so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was
</p>
<p>873</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Blanched Soldier
</p>
<p>framed in this gap. The window came down to
the ground and I could see the whole length of it,
but it was his face which held my gaze. He was
deadly pale&#8212;never have I seen a man so white. I
reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met
mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He
sprang back when he saw that I was looking at
him, and he vanished into the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was something shocking about the man,
Mr. Holmes. It wasn&#8217;t merely that ghastly face
glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness.
It was more subtle than that&#8212;something slinking,
something furtive, something guilty&#8212; something
very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known.
It left a feeling of horror in my mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But when a man has been soldiering for a year
or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps
his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly
vanished before I was at the window. There was
an awkward catch, and I was some little time be-
fore I could throw it up. Then I nipped through
and ran down the garden path in the direction that
I thought he might have taken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a long path and the light was not very
good, but it seemed to me something was moving
ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but
it was no use. When I got to the end of the path
there were several others branching in different di-
rections to various outhouses. I stood hesitating,
and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a
closing door. It was not behind me in the house,
but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That
was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I
had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away
from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of
that I was certain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing more I could do, and I
spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in
my mind and trying to find some theory which
would cover the facts. Next day I found the
colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife
remarked that there were some places of interest in
the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask
whether my presence for one more night would
incommode them. A somewhat grudging acqui-
escence from the old man gave me a clear day in
which to make my observations. I was already per-
fectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding some-
where near, but where and why remained to be
solved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The house was so large and so rambling that
a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the
wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me
to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard
</p>
<p>close was certainly not in the house. I must ex-
plore the garden and see what I could find. There
was no difficulty in the way, for the old people
were busy in their own fashion and left me to my
own devices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were several small outhouses, but at the
end of the garden there was a detached build-
ing of some size&#8212;large enough for a gardener&#8217;s
or a gamekeeper&#8217;s residence. Could this be the
place whence the sound of that shutting door
had come? I approached it in a careless fash-
ion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the
grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man
in a black coat and bowler hat&#8212;not at all the gar-
dener type&#8212;came out of the door. To my surprise,
he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket.
Then he looked at me with some surprise on his
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Are you a visitor here?&#8217; he asked.
&#8220;I explained that I was and that I was a friend
</p>
<p>of Godfrey&#8217;s.
&#8220; &#8216;What a pity that he should be away on his
</p>
<p>travels, for he would have so liked to see me,&#8217; I
continued.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Quite so. Exactly,&#8217; said he with a rather
guilty air. &#8216;No doubt you will renew your visit at
some more propitious time.&#8217; He passed on, but
when I turned I observed that he was standing
watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the
far end of the garden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a good look at the little house as I passed
it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so
far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my
own game and even be ordered off the premises if
I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that
I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to
the house and waited for night before I went on
with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I
slipped out of my window and made my way as
silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said that it was heavily curtained, but
now I found that the windows were shuttered as
well. Some light, however, was breaking through
one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon
this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been
quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter,
so that I could see the inside of the room. It was
a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blaz-
ing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man
whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking
a pipe and reading a paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What paper?&#8221; I asked.
My client seemed annoyed at the interruption
</p>
<p>of his narrative.
</p>
<p>874</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Can it matter?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is most essential.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really took no notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-
leafed paper or of that smaller type which one as-
sociates with weeklies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you mention it, it was not large. It
might have been the Spectator. However, I had lit-
tle thought to spare upon such details, for a second
man was seated with his back to the window, and
I could swear that this second man was Godfrey.
I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar
slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his
elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body
turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what
I should do when there was a sharp tap on my
shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This way, sir!&#8217; said he in a low voice. He
walked in silence to the house, and I followed him
into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-
table in the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There is a train to London at 8.30,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;The trap will be at the door at eight.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt
myself in so difficult a position that I could only
stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which
I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for
my friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The matter will not bear discussion,&#8217; said he
abruptly. &#8216;You have made a most damnable intru-
sion into the privacy of our family. You were here
as a guest and you have become a spy. I have noth-
ing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever
to see you again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I
spoke with some warmth.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I have seen your son, and I am convinced that
for some reason of your own you are concealing
him from the world. I have no idea what your mo-
tives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I
am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn
you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as
to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall
never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of
the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself
to be intimidated by anything which you may say
or do.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really
thought he was about to attack me. I have said
that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though
I am no weakling I might have been hard put to
</p>
<p>it to hold my own against him. However, after
a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and
walked out of the room. For my part, I took the
appointed train in the morning, with the full in-
tention of coming straight to you and asking for
your advice and assistance at the appointment for
which I had already written.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such was the problem which my visitor laid be-
fore me. It presented, as the astute reader will have
already perceived, few difficulties in its solution,
for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to
the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was,
there were points of interest and novelty about it
which may excuse my placing it upon record. I
now proceeded, using my familiar method of log-
ical analysis, to narrow down the possible solu-
tions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The servants,&#8221; I asked; &#8220;how many were in
the house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the best of my belief there were only the
old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the
simplest fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no servant, then, in the detached
house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None, unless the little man with the beard
acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite
a superior person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems very suggestive. Had you any
indication that food was conveyed from the one
house to the other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph
carrying a basket down the garden walk and going
in the direction of this house. The idea of food did
not occur to me at the moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you make any local inquiries?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and
</p>
<p>also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked
if they knew anything of my old comrade, God-
frey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he
had gone for a voyage round the world. He had
come home and then had almost at once started
off again. The story was evidently universally ac-
cepted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said nothing of your suspicions?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;That was very wise. The matter should cer-
</p>
<p>tainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to
Tuxbury Old Park.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day?&#8221;
It happened that at the moment I was clear-
</p>
<p>ing up the case which my friend Watson has de-
scribed as that of the Abbey School, in which the
Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I
had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey
</p>
<p>875</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Blanched Soldier
</p>
<p>which called for immediate action, as political con-
sequences of the gravest kind might arise from its
neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning
of the next week, as my diary records, that I was
able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire
in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove
to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gen-
tleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made
the necessary arrangements.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an old friend,&#8221; said I to Dodd. &#8220;It is
possible that his presence may be entirely unnec-
essary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential.
It is not necessary at the present stage to go further
into the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The narratives of Watson have accustomed the
reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste
words or disclose my thoughts while a case is
actually under consideration. Dodd seemed sur-
prised, but nothing more was said, and the three
of us continued our journey together. In the train
I asked Dodd one more question which I wished
our companion to hear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that you saw your friend&#8217;s face quite
clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure
of his identity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose
was pressed against the glass. The lamplight
shone full upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It could not have been someone resembling
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it was he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you say he was changed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in colour. His face was&#8212;how shall I de-
scribe it?&#8212;it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was
bleached.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it equally pale all over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. It was his brow which I saw so
clearly as it was pressed against the window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you call to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was too startled and horrified for the mo-
ment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but
without result.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My case was practically complete, and there
was only one small incident needed to round it off.
When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the
strange old rambling house which my client had
described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who
opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage
for the day and had asked my elderly friend to
remain within it unless we should summon him.
</p>
<p>Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the con-
ventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-
salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He
wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us
he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the
hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend
Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute
set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was
apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table.
I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off,
stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my
nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was un-
doubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour
was oozing. I passed on into the study with my
case complete. Alas, that I should have to show
my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by
concealing such links in the chain that Watson was
enabled to produce his meretricious finales.
</p>
<p>Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he
came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph&#8217;s mes-
sage. We heard his quick, heavy step in the pas-
sage. The door was flung open and he rushed in
with bristling beard and twisted features, as ter-
rible an old man as ever I have seen. He held
our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and
stamped on the fragments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I not told you, you infernal busybody,
that you are warned off the premises? Never dare
to show your damned face here again. If you enter
again without my leave I shall be within my rights
if I use violence. I&#8217;ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will!
As to you, sir,&#8221; turning upon me, &#8220;I extend the
same warning to you. I am familiar with your ig-
noble profession, but you must take your reputed
talents to some other field. There is no opening for
them here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot leave here,&#8221; said my client firmly,
&#8220;until I hear from Godfrey&#8217;s own lips that he is
under no restraint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our involuntary host rang the bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; he said, &#8220;telephone down to the
county police and ask the inspector to send up
two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You must be aware, Mr.
Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights
and that we have no legal status within his house.
On the other hand, he should recognize that your
action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his
son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have
five minutes&#8217; conversation with Colonel Emsworth
I could certainly alter his view of the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>876</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I am not so easily altered,&#8221; said the old sol-
dier. &#8220;Ralph, do what I have told you. What the
devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort,&#8221; I said, putting my back
to the door. &#8220;Any police interference would bring
about the very catastrophe which you dread.&#8221; I
took out my notebook and scribbled one word
upon a loose sheet. &#8220;That,&#8221; said I as I handed it to
Colonel Emsworth, &#8220;is what has brought us here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stared at the writing with a face from which
every expression save amazement had vanished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he gasped, sitting down
heavily in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my business to know things. That is my
trade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging
at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of
resignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It
is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand.
Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five
minutes we shall be with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the end of that time we passed down the
garden path and found ourselves in front of the
mystery house at the end. A small bearded man
stood at the door with a look of considerable as-
tonishment upon his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;This will disarrange all our plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been
forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is waiting inside.&#8221; He turned and led
us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A
man was standing with his back to the fire, and
at the sight of him my client sprang forward with
outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the other waved him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance.
Yes, you may well stare! I don&#8217;t quite look the
smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron,
do I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His appearance was certainly extraordinary.
One could see that he had indeed been a hand-
some man with clear-cut features sunburned by
an African sun, but mottled in patches over this
darker surface were curious whitish patches which
had bleached his skin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t court visitors,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done
</p>
<p>without your friend. I suppose there is some good
reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to be sure that all was well with you,
Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked
into my window, and I could not let the matter
rest till I had cleared things up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Ralph told me you were there, and I
couldn&#8217;t help taking a peep at you. I hoped you
would not have seen me, and I had to run to my
burrow when I heard the window go up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what in heaven&#8217;s name is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not a long story to tell,&#8221; said he,
lighting a cigarette. &#8220;You remember that morn-
ing fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the
Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three of us got separated from the others.
It was very broken country, you may remember.
There was Simpson&#8212;the fellow we called Baldy
Simpson&#8212; and Anderson, and I. We were clearing
brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us.
The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet
through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, how-
ever, and he galloped several miles before I fainted
and rolled off the saddle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came to myself it was nightfall, and
I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To
my surprise there was a house close beside me,
a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many
windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the
kind of numb cold which used to come at evening,
a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from
a crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the
bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching
that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged
myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I
have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps,
entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large
room which contained several beds, and throwing
myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one
of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not
at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body
and in a moment I was in a deep sleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was morning when I wakened, and it
seemed to me that instead of coming out into a
world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordi-
nary nightmare. The African sun flooded through
the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of
the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out
hard and clear. In front of me was standing a
small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head,
who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two
horrible hands which looked to me like brown
</p>
<p>877</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Blanched Soldier
</p>
<p>sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who
seemed to be intensely amused by the situation,
but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not
one of them was a normal human being. Every
one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some
strange way. The laughter of these strange mon-
strosities was a dreadful thing to hear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed that none of them could speak En-
glish, but the situation wanted clearing up, for
the creature with the big head was growing furi-
ously angry, and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had
laid his deformed hands upon me and was drag-
ging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of
blood from my wound. The little monster was as
strong as a bull, and I don&#8217;t know what he might
have done to me had not an elderly man who was
clearly in authority been attracted to the room by
the hubbub. He said a few stern words in Dutch,
and my persecutor shrank away. Then he turned
upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How in the world did you come here?&#8217; he
asked in amazement. &#8216;Wait a bit! I see that you
are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours
wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I&#8217;ll soon
have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far
greater danger here than ever you were on the bat-
tlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you
have slept in a leper&#8217;s bed.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in
view of the approaching battle all these poor crea-
tures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as
the British advanced, they had been brought back
by this, their medical superintendent, who assured
me that, though he believed he was immune to the
disease, he would none the less never have dared
to do what I had done. He put me in a private
room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so
I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So there you have my tragedy. I hoped against
hope, but it was not until I had reached home
that the terrible signs which you see upon my face
told me that I had not escaped. What was I to
do? I was in this lonely house. We had two ser-
vants whom we could utterly trust. There was a
house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy,
Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay
with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines.
The alternative was a dreadful one&#8212;segregation
for life among strangers with never a hope of re-
lease. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even
in this quiet countryside there would have been
an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my
horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie&#8212;even you had
</p>
<p>to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented
I cannot imagine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Emsworth pointed to me.
&#8220;This is the gentleman who forced my hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He unfolde
