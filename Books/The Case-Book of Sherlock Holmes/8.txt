<p>r. Sherlock Holmes was always of
opinion that I should publish the sin-
gular facts connected with Professor
Presbury, if only to dispel once for all
</p>
<p>the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago
agitated the university and were echoed in the
learned societies of London. There were, however,
certain obstacles in the way, and the true history
of this curious case remained entombed in the tin
box which contains so many records of my friend&#8217;s
adventures. Now we have at last obtained permis-
sion to ventilate the facts which formed one of the
very last cases handled by Holmes before his re-
tirement from practice. Even now a certain reti-
cence and discretion have to be observed in laying
the matter before the public.
</p>
<p>It was one Sunday evening early in September
of the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes&#8217;s
laconic messages:
</p>
<p>Come at once if convenient&#8212;if incon-
venient come all the same.
</p>
<p>&#8212; S. H.
</p>
<p>The relations between us in those latter days
were peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow
and concentrated habits, and I had become one of
them. As an institution I was like the violin, the
shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books,
and others perhaps less excusable. When it was
a case of active work and a comrade was needed
upon whose nerve he could place some reliance,
my role was obvious. But apart from this I had
uses. I was a whetstone for his mind. I stimu-
lated him. He liked to think aloud in my presence.
His remarks could hardly be said to be made to
me&#8212;many of them would have been as appropri-
ately addressed to his bedstead&#8212;but none the less,
having formed the habit, it had become in some
way helpful that I should register and interject. If
I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in
my mentality, that irritation served only to make
his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash
up the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my
humble role in our alliance.
</p>
<p>When I arrived at Baker Street I found him
huddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees,
his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with
thought. It was clear that he was in the throes of
some vexatious problem. With a wave of his hand
he indicated my old armchair, but otherwise for
half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware
of my presence. Then with a start he seemed to
</p>
<p>come from his reverie, and with his usual whim-
sical smile he greeted me back to what had once
been my home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind,
my dear Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Some curious facts
have been submitted to me within the last twenty-
four hours, and they in turn have given rise to
some speculations of a more general character. I
have serious thoughts of writing a small mono-
graph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the
detective.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Bloodhounds&#8212;sleuth-hounds&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of
course, obvious. But there is another which is far
more subtle. You may recollect that in the case
which you, in your sensational way, coupled with
the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the
mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the
criminal habits of the very smug and respectable
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember it well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous.
A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky
dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy
one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, danger-
ous people have dangerous ones. And their pass-
ing moods may reflect the passing moods of oth-
ers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I shook my head. &#8220;Surely, Holmes, this is a
little far-fetched,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>He had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat,
taking no notice of my comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The practical application of what I have said
is very close to the problem which I am investi-
gating. It is a tangled skein, you understand, and
I am looking for a loose end. One possible loose
end lies in the question: Why does Professor Pres-
bury&#8217;s wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sank back in my chair in some disappoint-
ment. Was it for so trivial a question as this that
I had been summoned from my work? Holmes
glanced across at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same old Watson!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You never
learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the
smallest things. But is it not on the face of it
strange that a staid, elderly philosopher&#8212;you&#8217;ve
heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Cam-
ford physiologist?&#8212;that such a man, whose friend
has been his devoted wolfhound, should now have
been twice attacked by his own dog? What do you
make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>937</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Creeping Man
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog is ill.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that has to be considered. But he at-
</p>
<p>tacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest
his master, save on very special occasions. Curi-
ous, Watson&#8212;very curious. But young Mr. Bennett
is before his time if that is his ring. I had hoped to
have a longer chat with you before he came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp
tap at the door, and a moment later the new client
presented himself. He was a tall, handsome youth
about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with
something in his bearing which suggested the shy-
ness of the student rather than the self-possession
of the man of the world. He shook hands with
Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Consider the relation in which I stand to
Professor Presbury both privately and publicly. I
really can hardly justify myself if I speak before
any third person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear, Mr. Bennett. Dr. Watson is the
very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that
this is a matter in which I am very likely to need
an assistant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like, Mr. Holmes. You will, I am sure,
understand my having some reserves in the mat-
ter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you
that this gentleman, Mr. Trevor Bennett, is profes-
sional assistant to the great scientist, lives under
his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. Cer-
tainly we must agree that the professor has every
claim upon his loyalty and devotion. But it may
best be shown by taking the necessary steps to
clear up this strange mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, Mr. Holmes. That is my one object.
Does Dr. Watson know the situation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not had time to explain it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then perhaps I had better go over the
</p>
<p>ground again before explaining some fresh devel-
opments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do so myself,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;in order to
show that I have the events in their due order. The
professor, Watson, is a man of European reputa-
tion. His life has been academic. There has never
been a breath of scandal. He is a widower with
one daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very
virile and positive, one might almost say combat-
ive, character. So the matter stood until a very few
months ago.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the current of his life was broken. He is
sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to
</p>
<p>the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in
the chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as
I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly
man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for
no one could have shown himself a more devoted
lover. The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect
girl both in mind and body, so that there was ev-
ery excuse for the professor&#8217;s infatuation. None
the less, it did not meet with full approval in his
own family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought it rather excessive,&#8221; said our visi-
tor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Excessive and a little violent and un-
natural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and
there was no objection upon the part of the father.
The daughter, however, had other views, and there
were already several candidates for her hand, who,
if they were less eligible from a worldly point of
view, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed
to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It
was only age which stood in the way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About this time a little mystery suddenly
clouded the normal routine of the professor&#8217;s life.
He did what he had never done before. He left
home and gave no indication where he was go-
ing. He was away a fortnight and returned looking
rather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where
he had been, although he was usually the frank-
est of men. It chanced, however, that our client
here, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-
student in Prague, who said that he was glad to
have seen Professor Presbury there, although he
had not been able to talk to him. Only in this way
did his own household learn where he had been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now comes the point. From that time onward
a curious change came over the professor. He be-
came furtive and sly. Those around him had al-
ways the feeling that he was not the man that they
had known, but that he was under some shadow
which had darkened his higher qualities. His in-
tellect was not affected. His lectures were as bril-
liant as ever. But always there was something new,
something sinister and unexpected. His daughter,
who was devoted to him, tried again and again
to resume the old relations and to penetrate this
mask which her father seemed to have put on.
You, sir, as I understand, did the same&#8212;but all
was in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your
own words the incident of the letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the
professor had no secrets from me. If I were his
son or his younger brother I could not have more
completely enjoyed his confidence. As his secre-
tary I handled every paper which came to him,
and I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly
</p>
<p>938</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>after his return all this was changed. He told me
that certain letters might come to him from Lon-
don which would be marked by a cross under the
stamp. These were to be set aside for his own
eyes only. I may say that several of these did
pass through my hands, that they had the E. C.
mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If
he answered them at all the answers did not pass
through my hands nor into the letter-basket in
which our correspondence was collected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the box,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, the box. The professor brought back
a little wooden box from his travels. It was the one
thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it
was one of those quaint carved things which one
associates with Germany. This he placed in his
instrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a
canula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was
very angry, and reproved me in words which were
quite savage for my curiosity. It was the first time
such a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt.
I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere acci-
dent that I had touched the box, but all the evening
I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and
that the incident was rankling in his mind.&#8221; Mr.
Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket.
&#8220;That was on July 2d,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly an admirable witness,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;I may need some of these dates which
you have noted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned method among other things from
my great teacher. From the time that I observed
abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my
duty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it
was on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the
professor as he came from his study into the hall.
Again, on July 11th, there was a scene of the same
sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon
July 20th. After that we had to banish Roy to the
stables. He was a dear, affectionate animal&#8212;but I
fear I weary you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it
was very clear that Holmes was not listening. His
face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at
the ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Singular! Most singular!&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;These details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I
think we have now fairly gone over the old ground,
have we not? But you spoke of some fresh devel-
opments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded
over, shadowed by some grim remembrance.
&#8220;What I speak of occurred the night before last,&#8221;
</p>
<p>said he. &#8220;I was lying awake about two in the morn-
ing, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound
coming from the passage. I opened my door and
peeped out. I should explain that the professor
sleeps at the end of the passage&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The date being&#8212;?&#8221; asked Holmes.
Our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant
</p>
<p>an interruption.
&#8220;I have said, sir, that it was the night before
</p>
<p>last&#8212;that is, September 4th.&#8221;
Holmes nodded and smiled.
&#8220;Pray continue,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;He sleeps at the end of the passage and
</p>
<p>would have to pass my door in order to reach
the staircase. It was a really terrifying experience,
Mr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved
as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I
saw. The passage was dark save that one window
halfway along it threw a patch of light. I could
see that something was coming along the passage,
something dark and crouching. Then suddenly it
emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. He
was crawling, Mr. Holmes&#8212;crawling! He was not
quite on his hands and knees. I should rather say
on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between
his hands. Yet he seemed to move with ease. I was
so paralyzed by the sight that it was not until he
had reached my door that I was able to step for-
ward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was
extraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atro-
cious word at me, and hurried on past me, and
down the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but
he did not come back. It must have been daylight
before he regained his room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, what make you of that?&#8221; asked
Holmes with the air of the pathologist who
presents a rare specimen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lumbago, possibly. I have known a severe at-
tack make a man walk in just such a way, and noth-
ing would be more trying to the temper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, Watson! You always keep us flat-footed
on the ground. But we can hardly accept lumbago,
since he was able to stand erect in a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was never better in health,&#8221; said Bennett.
&#8220;In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for
years. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not
a case in which we can consult the police, and yet
we are utterly at our wit&#8217;s end as to what to do,
and we feel in some strange way that we are drift-
ing towards disaster. Edith&#8212;Miss Presbury&#8212;feels
as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly a very curious and suggestive
case. What do you think, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>939</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Creeping Man
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking as a medical man,&#8221; said I, &#8220;it ap-
pears to be a case for an alienist. The old gen-
tleman&#8217;s cerebral processes were disturbed by the
love affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope
of breaking himself of the passion. His letters and
the box may be connected with some other private
transaction&#8212;a loan, perhaps, or share certificates,
which are in the box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of
the financial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is
more in it than this. Now, I can only suggest&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>What Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest
will never be known, for at this moment the door
opened and a young lady was shown into the
room. As she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up
with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to
meet those which she had herself outstretched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith, dear! Nothing the matter, I hope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I must follow you. Oh, Jack, I have been
so dreadfully frightened! It is awful to be there
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of.
This is my fiancee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were gradually coming to that conclusion,
were we not, Watson?&#8221; Holmes answered with
a smile. &#8220;I take it, Miss Presbury, that there is
some fresh development in the case, and that you
thought we should know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a
conventional English type, smiled back at Holmes
as she seated herself beside Mr. Bennett.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I found Mr. Bennett had left his hotel
I thought I should probably find him here. Of
course, he had told me that he would consult you.
But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my
poor father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is
still obscure. Perhaps what you have to say may
throw some fresh light upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was last night, Mr. Holmes. He had been
very strange all day. I am sure that there are times
when he has no recollection of what he does. He
lives as in a strange dream. Yesterday was such a
day. It was not my father with whom I lived. His
outward shell was there, but it was not really he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was awakened in the night by the dog bark-
ing most furiously. Poor Roy, he is chained now
near the stable. I may say that I always sleep with
my door locked; for, as Jack&#8212;as Mr. Bennett&#8212;will
tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger.
My room is on the second floor. It happened that
</p>
<p>the blind was up in my window, and there was
bright moonlight outside. As I lay with my eyes
fixed upon the square of light, listening to the fren-
zied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my
father&#8217;s face looking in at me. Mr. Holmes, I nearly
died of surprise and horror. There it was pressed
against the window-pane, and one hand seemed to
be raised as if to push up the window. If that win-
dow had opened, I think I should have gone mad.
It was no delusion, Mr. Holmes. Don&#8217;t deceive
yourself by thinking so. I dare say it was twenty
seconds or so that I lay paralyzed and watched the
face. Then it vanished, but I could not&#8212;I could
not spring out of bed and look out after it. I lay
cold and shivering till morning. At breakfast he
was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no al-
lusion to the adventure of the night. Neither did
I, but I gave an excuse for coming to town&#8212;and
here I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss
Presbury&#8217;s narrative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady, you say that your room
is on the second floor. Is there a long ladder in the
garden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes, that is the amazing part of
it. There is no possible way of reaching the win-
dow&#8212;and yet he was there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The date being September 5th,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;That certainly complicates matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the young lady&#8217;s turn to look surprised.
&#8220;This is the second time that you have alluded to
the date, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said Bennett. &#8220;Is it possible
that it has any bearing upon the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible&#8212;very possible&#8212;and yet I have
not my full material at present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly you are thinking of the connection
between insanity and phases of the moon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I assure you. It was quite a different
line of thought. Possibly you can leave your note-
book with me, and I will check the dates. Now I
think, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly
clear. This young lady has informed us&#8212;and I
have the greatest confidence in her intuition&#8212;that
her father remembers little or nothing which oc-
curs upon certain dates. We will therefore call
upon him as if he had given us an appointment
upon such a date. He will put it down to his own
lack of memory. Thus we will open our campaign
by having a good close view of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is excellent,&#8221; said Mr. Bennett. &#8220;I warn
you, however, that the professor is irascible and
violent at times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled. &#8220;There are reasons why we
should come at once&#8212;very cogent reasons if my
</p>
<p>940</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>theories hold good. To-morrow, Mr. Bennett, will
certainly see us in Camford. There is, if I remem-
ber right, an inn called the Chequers where the
port used to be above mediocrity and the linen was
above reproach. I think, Watson, that our lot for
the next few days might lie in less pleasant places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Monday morning found us on our way to the
famous university town&#8212;an easy effort on the part
of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one
which involved frantic planning and hurrying on
my part, as my practice was by this time not incon-
siderable. Holmes made no allusion to the case
until after we had deposited our suitcases at the
ancient hostel of which he had spoken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Watson, that we can catch the profes-
sor just before lunch. He lectures at eleven and
should have an interval at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What possible excuse have we for calling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes glanced at his notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a period of excitement upon Au-
gust 26th. We will assume that he is a little hazy
as to what he does at such times. If we insist that
we are there by appointment I think he will hardly
venture to contradict us. Have you the effrontery
necessary to put it through?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can but try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! Compound of the Busy Bee
and Excelsior. We can but try&#8212;the motto of the
firm. A friendly native will surely guide us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such a one on the back of a smart hansom
swept us past a row of ancient colleges and, finally
turning into a tree-lined drive, pulled up at the
door of a charming house, girt round with lawns
and covered with purple wisteria. Professor Pres-
bury was certainly surrounded with every sign not
only of comfort but of luxury. Even as we pulled
up, a grizzled head appeared at the front window,
and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from
under shaggy brows which surveyed us through
large horn glasses. A moment later we were actu-
ally in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist,
whose vagaries had brought us from London, was
standing before us. There was certainly no sign
of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance,
for he was a portly, large-featured man, grave,
tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing
which a lecturer needs. His eyes were his most
remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to
the verge of cunning.
</p>
<p>He looked at our cards. &#8220;Pray sit down, gentle-
men. What can I do for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes smiled amiably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the question which I was about to put
to you, Professor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, sir!&#8221;
&#8220;Possibly there is some mistake. I heard
</p>
<p>through a second person that Professor Presbury
of Camford had need of my services.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; It seemed to me that there was
a malicious sparkle in the intense gray eyes. &#8220;You
heard that, did you? May I ask the name of your
informant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was
rather confidential. If I have made a mistake there
is no harm done. I can only express my regret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I should wish to go further into
this matter. It interests me. Have you any scrap
of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your
assertion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not.&#8221;
&#8220;I presume that you do not go so far as to assert
</p>
<p>that I summoned you?&#8221;
&#8220;I would rather answer no questions,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>Holmes.
&#8220;No, I dare say not,&#8221; said the professor with
</p>
<p>asperity. &#8220;However, that particular one can be an-
swered very easily without your aid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked across the room to the bell. Our
London friend, Mr. Bennett, answered the call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Mr. Bennett. These two gentlemen
have come from London under the impression that
they have been summoned. You handle all my cor-
respondence. Have you a note of anything going
to a person named Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Bennett answered with a flush.
&#8220;That is conclusive,&#8221; said the professor, glaring
</p>
<p>angrily at my companion. &#8220;Now, sir&#8221;&#8212;he leaned
forward with his two hands upon the table&#8212;&#8220;it
seems to me that your position is a very question-
able one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have
</p>
<p>made a needless intrusion.&#8221;
&#8220;Hardly enough, Mr. Holmes!&#8221; the old man
</p>
<p>cried in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary
malignancy upon his face. He got between us and
the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands
at us with furious passion. &#8220;You can hardly get
out of it so easily as that.&#8221; His face was convulsed,
and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless
rage. I am convinced that we should have had to
fight our way out of the room if Mr. Bennett had
not intervened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Professor,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;consider your
position! Consider the scandal at the university!
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Creeping Man
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes is a well-known man. You cannot pos-
sibly treat him with such discourtesy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sulkily our host&#8212;if I may call him so&#8212;cleared
the path to the door. We were glad to find our-
selves outside the house and in the quiet of the
tree-lined drive. Holmes seemed greatly amused
by the episode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our learned friend&#8217;s nerves are somewhat out
of order,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps our intrusion was a
little crude, and yet we have gained that personal
contact which I desired. But, dear me, Watson, he
is surely at our heels. The villain still pursues us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were the sounds of running feet behind,
but it was, to my relief, not the formidable pro-
fessor but his assistant who appeared round the
curve of the drive. He came panting up to us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, Mr. Holmes. I wished to apolo-
gize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir, there is no need. It is all in the
way of professional experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen him in a more dangerous
mood. But he grows more sinister. You can under-
stand now why his daughter and I are alarmed.
And yet his mind is perfectly clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too clear!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;That was my mis-
calculation. It is evident that his memory is much
more reliable than I had thought. By the way, can
we, before we go, see the window of Miss Pres-
bury&#8217;s room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett pushed his way through some
shrubs, and we had a view of the side of the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is there. The second on the left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, it seems hardly accessible. And yet
you will observe that there is a creeper below and
a water-pipe above which give some foothold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not climb it myself,&#8221; said Mr. Bennett.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely. It would certainly be a dangerous
exploit for any normal man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one other thing I wish to tell you,
Mr. Holmes. I have the address of the man in
London to whom the professor writes. He seems
to have written this morning, and I got it from
his blotting-paper. It is an ignoble position for a
trusted secretary, but what else can I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorak&#8212;a curious name. Slavonic, I imagine.
Well, it is an important link in the chain. We return
to London this afternoon, Mr. Bennett. I see no
good purpose to be served by our remaining. We
cannot arrest the professor because he has done no
</p>
<p>crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for
he cannot be proved to be mad. No action is as yet
possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what on earth are we to do?&#8221;
&#8220;A little patience, Mr. Bennett. Things will
</p>
<p>soon develop. Unless I am mistaken, next Tues-
day may mark a crisis. Certainly we shall be in
Camford on that day. Meanwhile, the general po-
sition is undeniably unpleasant, and if Miss Pres-
bury can prolong her visit&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is easy.&#8221;
&#8220;Then let her stay till we can assure her that all
</p>
<p>danger is past. Meanwhile, let him have his way
and do not cross him. So long as he is in a good
humour all is well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; said Bennett in a startled whis-
per. Looking between the branches we saw the
tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door and
look around him. He stood leaning forward, his
hands swinging straight before him, his head turn-
ing from side to side. The secretary with a last
wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him
presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the
house together in what seemed to be animated and
even excited conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect the old gentleman has been putting
two and two together,&#8221; said Holmes as we walked
hotelward. &#8220;He struck me as having a particularly
clear and logical brain from the little I saw of him.
Explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of
view he has something to explode about if detec-
tives are put on his track and he suspects his own
household of doing it. I rather fancy that friend
Bennett is in for an uncomfortable time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes stopped at a post-office and sent off a
telegram on our way. The answer reached us in
the evening, and he tossed it across to me.
</p>
<p>Have visited the Commercial Road and
seen Dorak. Suave person, Bohemian,
elderly. Keeps large general store.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Mercer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercer is since your time,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;He
is my general utility man who looks up routine
business. It was important to know something of
the man with whom our professor was so secretly
corresponding. His nationality connects up with
the Prague visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness that something connects with
something,&#8221; said I. &#8220;At present we seem to be
faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents
with no bearing upon each other. For example,
what possible connection can there be between an
angry wolfhound and a visit to Bohemia, or either
</p>
<p>942</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>of them with a man crawling down a passage at
night? As to your dates, that is the biggest mysti-
fication of all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. We
were, I may say, seated in the old sitting-room of
the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vin-
tage of which Holmes had spoken on the table be-
tween us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, let us take the dates first,&#8221; said
he, his finger-tips together and his manner as if
he were addressing a class. &#8220;This excellent young
man&#8217;s diary shows that there was trouble upon
July 2d, and from then onward it seems to have
been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as I remem-
ber, only one exception. Thus the last outbreak
upon Friday was on September 3d, which also falls
into the series, as did August 26th, which preceded
it. The thing is beyond coincidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was forced to agree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us, then, form the provisional theory that
every nine days the professor takes some strong
drug which has a passing but highly poisonous
effect. His naturally violent nature is intensified
by it. He learned to take this drug while he was in
Prague, and is now supplied with it by a Bohemian
intermediary in London. This all hangs together,
Watson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the dog, the face at the window, the creep-
ing man in the passage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we have made a beginning. I
should not expect any fresh developments until
next Tuesday. In the meantime we can only keep in
touch with friend Bennett and enjoy the amenities
of this charming town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the morning Mr. Bennett slipped round to
bring us the latest report. As Holmes had imag-
ined, times had not been easy with him. With-
out exactly accusing him of being responsible for
our presence, the professor had been very rough
and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some
strong grievance. This morning he was quite him-
self again, however, and had delivered his usual
brilliant lecture to a crowded class. &#8220;Apart from
his queer fits,&#8221; said Bennett, &#8220;he has actually more
energy and vitality than I can ever remember, nor
was his brain ever clearer. But it&#8217;s not he&#8212;it&#8217;s
never the man whom we have known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have anything to fear now
for a week at least,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;I am a
busy man, and Dr. Watson has his patients to at-
tend to. Let us agree that we meet here at this hour
next Tuesday, and I shall be surprised if before we
leave you again we are not able to explain, even if
</p>
<p>we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles.
Meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw nothing of my friend for the next few
days, but on the following Monday evening I had
a short note asking me to meet him next day at
the train. From what he told me as we travelled
up to Camford all was well, the peace of the pro-
fessor&#8217;s house had been unruffled, and his own
conduct perfectly normal. This also was the report
which was given us by Mr. Bennett himself when
he called upon us that evening at our old quarters
in the Chequers. &#8220;He heard from his London cor-
respondent to-day. There was a letter and there
was a small packet, each with the cross under the
stamp which warned me not to touch them. There
has been nothing else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may prove quite enough,&#8221; said Holmes
grimly. &#8220;Now, Mr. Bennett, we shall, I think, come
to some conclusion to-night. If my deductions are
correct we should have an opportunity of bringing
matters to a head. In order to do so it is necessary
to hold the professor under observation. I would
suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on
the lookout. Should you hear him pass your door,
do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly
as you can. Dr. Watson and I will not be far off. By
the way, where is the key of that little box of which
you spoke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon his watch-chain.&#8221;
&#8220;I fancy our researches must lie in that direc-
</p>
<p>tion. At the worst the lock should not be very
formidable. Have you any other able-bodied man
on the premises?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the coachman, Macphail.&#8221;
&#8220;Where does he sleep?&#8221;
&#8220;Over the stables.&#8221;
&#8220;We might possibly want him. Well, we can do
</p>
<p>no more until we see how things develop. Good-
bye&#8212;but I expect that we shall see you before
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight before we took our sta-
tion among some bushes immediately opposite the
hall door of the professor. It was a fine night, but
chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats.
There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding
across the sky, obscuring from time to time the
half-moon. It would have been a dismal vigil were
it not for the expectation and excitement which
carried us along, and the assurance of my com-
rade that we had probably reached the end of the
strange sequence of events which had engaged our
attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the cycle of nine days holds good then we
shall have the professor at his worst to-night,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>943</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Creeping Man
</p>
<p>Holmes. &#8220;The fact that these strange symptoms
began after his visit to Prague, that he is in se-
cret correspondence with a Bohemian dealer in
London, who presumably represents someone in
Prague, and that he received a packet from him
this very day, all point in one direction. What he
takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken,
but that it emanates in some way from Prague is
clear enough. He takes it under definite directions
which regulate this ninth-day system, which was
the first point which attracted my attention. But
his symptoms are most remarkable. Did you ob-
serve his knuckles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had to confess that I did not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thick and horny in a way which is quite new
in my experience. Always look at the hands first,
Watson. Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. Very
curious knuckles which can only be explained by
the mode of progression observed by&#8212;&#8221; Holmes
paused and suddenly clapped his hand to his fore-
head. &#8220;Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have
been! It seems incredible, and yet it must be true.
All points in one direction. How could I miss see-
ing the connection of ideas? Those knuckles&#8212;how
could I have passed those knuckles? And the dog!
And the ivy! It&#8217;s surely time that I disappeared
into that little farm of my dreams. Look out, Wat-
son! Here he is! We shall have the chance of seeing
for ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hall door had slowly opened, and against
the lamplit background we saw the tall figure of
Professor Presbury. He was clad in his dressing-
gown. As he stood outlined in the doorway he was
erect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as
when we saw him last.
</p>
<p>Now he stepped forward into the drive, and
an extraordinary change came over him. He sank
down into a crouching position and moved along
upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and
then as if he were overflowing with energy and vi-
tality. He moved along the face of the house and
then round the corner. As he disappeared Bennett
slipped through the hall door and softly followed
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Watson, come!&#8221; cried Holmes, and we
stole as softly as we could through the bushes un-
til we had gained a spot whence we could see
the other side of the house, which was bathed
in the light of the half-moon. The professor was
clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-
covered wall. As we watched him he suddenly
began with incredible agility to ascend it. From
branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm
of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his
</p>
<p>own powers, with no definite object in view. With
his dressing-gown flappin
