<p>omewhere in the vaults of the bank of
Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is
a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-
box with my name, John H. Watson,
</p>
<p>M.D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It
is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are
records of cases to illustrate the curious problems
which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to
examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were
complete failures, and as such will hardly bear
narrating, since no final explanation is forthcom-
ing. A problem without a solution may interest
the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual
reader. Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr.
James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own
house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in
this world. No less remarkable is that of the cut-
ter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a
small patch of mist from where she never again
emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of
herself and her crew. A third case worthy of note
is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known jour-
nalist and duellist, who was found stark staring
mad with a match box in front of him which con-
tained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to
science. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there
are some which involve the secrets of private fam-
ilies to an extent which would mean consternation
in many exalted quarters if it were thought pos-
sible that they might find their way into print. I
need not say that such a breach of confidence is
unthinkable, and that these records will be sepa-
rated and destroyed now that my friend has time
to turn his energies to the matter. There remain a
considerable residue of cases of greater or less in-
terest which I might have edited before had I not
feared to give the public a surfeit which might re-
act upon the reputation of the man whom above
all others I revere. In some I was myself concerned
and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others
I was either not present or played so small a part
that they could only be told as by a third person.
The following narrative is drawn from my own ex-
perience.
</p>
<p>It was a wild morning in October, and I ob-
served as I was dressing how the last remaining
leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane
tree which graces the yard behind our house. I de-
scended to breakfast prepared to find my compan-
ion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he
was easily impressed by his surroundings. On the
contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his
meal, and that his mood was particularly bright
and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerful-
ness which was characteristic of his lighter mo-
</p>
<p>ments.
&#8220;You have a case, Holmes?&#8221; I remarked.
&#8220;The faculty of deduction is certainly conta-
</p>
<p>gious, Watson,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;It has enabled you
to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After
a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels
move once more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I share it?&#8221;
&#8220;There is little to share, but we may discuss
</p>
<p>it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled
eggs with which our new cook has favoured us.
Their condition may not be unconnected with the
copy of the Family Herald which I observed yester-
day upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter
as cooking an egg demands an attention which is
conscious of the passage of time and incompatible
with the love romance in that excellent periodical.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the table had been
cleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a
letter from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold
King?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the American Senator?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, he was once Senator for some Western
</p>
<p>state, but is better known as the greatest gold-
mining magnate in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know of him. He has surely lived in
England for some time. His name is very famil-
iar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he bought a considerable estate in Hamp-
shire some five years ago. Possibly you have al-
ready heard of the tragic end of his wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I remember it now. That is why the
name is familiar. But I really know nothing of the
details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes waved his hand towards some papers
on a chair. &#8220;I had no idea that the case was coming
my way or I should have had my extracts ready,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;The fact is that the problem, though ex-
ceedingly sensational, appeared to present no dif-
ficulty. The interesting personality of the accused
does not obscure the clearness of the evidence.
That was the view taken by the coroner&#8217;s jury and
also in the police-court proceedings. It is now re-
ferred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a
thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson,
but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely
new and unexpected ones come to light I do not
see what my client can hope for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your client?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting
</p>
<p>into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story
backward. You had best read this first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>923</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem of Thor Bridge
</p>
<p>The letter which he handed to me, written in a
bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:
</p>
<p>Claridge&#8217;s Hotel
October 3rd.
</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:
I can&#8217;t see the best woman God ever
</p>
<p>made go to her death without doing all
that is possible to save her. I can&#8217;t ex-
plain things&#8212;I can&#8217;t even try to explain
them, but I know beyond all doubt that
Miss Dunbar is innocent. You know
the facts&#8212;who doesn&#8217;t? It has been
the gossip of the country. And never
a voice raised for her! It&#8217;s the damned
injustice of it all that makes me crazy.
That woman has a heart that wouldn&#8217;t
let her kill a fly. Well, I&#8217;ll come at eleven
to-morrow and see if you can get some
ray of light in the dark. Maybe I have
a clue and don&#8217;t know it. Anyhow, all
I know and all I have and all I am are
for your use if only you can save her. If
ever in your life you showed your pow-
ers, put them now into this case.
</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
J. Neil Gibson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have it,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes,
knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe
and slowly refilling it. &#8220;That is the gentleman I
await. As to the story, you have hardly time to
master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a
nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in
the proceedings. This man is the greatest financial
power in the world, and a man, as I understand,
of most violent and formidable character. He mar-
ried a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I
know nothing save that she was past her prime,
which was the more unfortunate as a very attrac-
tive governess superintended the education of two
young children. These are the three people con-
cerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house,
the centre of a historical English state. Then as to
the tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds
nearly half a mile from the house, late at night,
clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her
shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain.
No weapon was found near her and there was
no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near
her, Watson&#8212;mark that! The crime seems to have
been committed late in the evening, and the body
was found by a game-keeper about eleven o&#8217;clock,
when it was examined by the police and by a doc-
tor before being carried up to the house. Is this too
condensed, or can you follow it clearly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all very clear. But why suspect the gov-
erness?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place there is some very direct
evidence. A revolver with one discharged cham-
ber and a calibre which corresponded with the
bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.&#8221;
His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words,
&#8220;On&#8212;the&#8212;floor&#8212;of&#8212;her&#8212;wardrobe.&#8221; Then he
sank into silence, and I saw that some train of
thought had been set moving which I should be
foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he
emerged into brisk life once more. &#8220;Yes, Watson, it
was found. Pretty damning, eh? So the two juries
thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon
her making an appointment at that very place and
signed by the governess. How&#8217;s that? Finally there
is the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive per-
son. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed
her than the young lady who had already by all
accounts received pressing attentions from her em-
ployer? Love, fortune, power, all depending upon
one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson&#8212;very ugly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary,
she had to admit that she was down near Thor
Bridge&#8212;that was the scene of the tragedy&#8212;about
that hour. She couldn&#8217;t deny it, for some passing
villager had seen her there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That really seems final.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, Watson&#8212;and yet! This bridge&#8212;a
single broad span of stone with balustraded
sides&#8212;carries the drive over the narrowest part of
a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it
is called. In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead
woman. Such are the main facts. But here, if I
mistake not, is our client, considerably before his
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy had opened the door, but the name which
he announced was an unexpected one. Mr. Mar-
low Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a
thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes
and a twitching, hesitating manner&#8212;a man whom
my own professional eye would judge to be on the
brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Pray sit down. I fear I can only give you a short
time, for I have an appointment at eleven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you have,&#8221; our visitor gasped, shoot-
ing out short sentences like a man who is out of
breath. &#8220;Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is my
employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes,
he is a villain&#8212;an infernal villain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong language, Mr. Bates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>924</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the
time is so limited. I would not have him find me
here for the world. He is almost due now. But I
was so situated that I could not come earlier. His
secretary, Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning
of his appointment with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are his manager?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I
shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. A hard
man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him. Those
public charities are a screen to cover his private in-
iquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was
brutal to her&#8212;yes, sir, brutal! How she came by
her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had
made her life a misery to her. She was a creature
of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it had escaped me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. A
child of the sun and of passion. She had loved him
as such women can love, but when her own phys-
ical charms had faded&#8212;I am told that they once
were great&#8212;there was nothing to hold him. We
all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the
way that he treated her. But he is plausible and
cunning. That is all I have to say to you. Don&#8217;t
take him at his face value. There is more behind.
Now I&#8217;ll go. No, no, don&#8217;t detain me! He is almost
due.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a frightened look at the clock our strange
visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; said Holmes after an interval of
silence. &#8220;Mr. Gibson seems to have a nice loyal
household. But the warning is a useful one, and
now we can only wait till the man himself ap-
pears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon
the stairs, and the famous millionaire was shown
into the room. As I looked upon him I under-
stood not only the fears and dislike of his man-
ager but also the execrations which so many busi-
ness rivals have heaped upon his head. If I were
a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful
man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of con-
science, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my
model. His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a sugges-
tion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln
keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give
some idea of the man. His face might have been
chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless,
with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a cri-
sis. Cold gray eyes, looking shrewdly out from
under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn.
</p>
<p>He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes men-
tioned my name, and then with a masterful air
of possession he drew a chair up to my compan-
ion and seated himself with his bony knees almost
touching him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;that money is nothing to me in this case. You can
burn it if it&#8217;s any use in lighting you to the truth.
This woman is innocent and this woman has to be
cleared, and it&#8217;s up to you to do it. Name your
figure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My professional charges are upon a fixed
scale,&#8221; said Holmes coldly. &#8220;I do not vary them,
save when I remit them altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if dollars make no difference to you,
think of the reputation. If you pull this off every
paper in England and America will be booming
you. You&#8217;ll be the talk of two continents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I
am in need of booming. It may surprise you to
know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that
it is the problem itself which attracts me. But we
are wasting time. Let us get down to the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that you will find all the main ones in
the press reports. I don&#8217;t know that I can add any-
thing which will help you. But if there is anything
you would wish more light upon&#8212;well, I am here
to give it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is just one point.&#8221;
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;
&#8220;What were the exact relations between you
</p>
<p>and Miss Dunbar?&#8221;
The Gold King gave a violent start and half rose
</p>
<p>from his chair. Then his massive calm came back
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are within your rights&#8212;and
maybe doing your duty&#8212;in asking such a ques-
tion, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will agree to suppose so,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Then I can assure you that our relations were
</p>
<p>entirely and always those of an employer towards
a young lady whom he never conversed with, or
ever saw, save when she was in the company of
his children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rose from his chair.
&#8220;I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,&#8221; said he,
</p>
<p>&#8220;and I have no time or taste for aimless conversa-
tions. I wish you good-morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose
figure towered above Holmes. There was an an-
gry gleam from under those bristling brows and a
tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.
</p>
<p>925</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem of Thor Bridge
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you mean by this, Mr.
Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I
should have thought my words were plain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plain enough, but what&#8217;s at the back of it?
Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or
what? I&#8217;ve a right to a plain answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps you have,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you one. This case is quite sufficiently com-
plicated to start with without the further difficulty
of false information.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that I lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as
I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not
contradict you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon
the millionaire&#8217;s face was fiendish in its intensity,
and he had raised his great knotted fist. Holmes
smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his
pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after
breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling.
I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little
quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With an effort the Gold King mastered his fury.
I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-
command he had turned in a minute from a hot
flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indif-
ference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your choice. I guess you know how
to run your own business. I can&#8217;t make you touch
the case against your will. You&#8217;ve done yourself no
good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken
stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me
and was the better for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So many have said so, and yet here I am,&#8221; said
Holmes, smiling. &#8220;Well, good-morning, Mr. Gib-
son. You have a good deal yet to learn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes
smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes
fixed upon the ceiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any views, Watson?&#8221; he asked at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I con-
sider that this is a man who would certainly brush
any obstacle from his path, and when I remember
that his wife may have been an obstacle and an ob-
ject of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it
seems to me&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. And to me also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what were his relations with the gov-
erness, and how did you discover them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the
passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of
his letter and contrasted it with his self-contained
manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that
there was some deep emotion which centred upon
the accused woman rather than upon the victim.
We&#8217;ve got to understand the exact relations of
those three people if we are to reach the truth. You
saw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and
how imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed
him by giving him the impression that I was abso-
lutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely
suspicious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he will come back?&#8221;
&#8220;He is sure to come back. He must come back.
</p>
<p>He can&#8217;t leave it where it is. Ha! isn&#8217;t that a ring?
Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was
just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat
overdue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Gold King had reentered the room in a
more chastened mood than he had left it. His
wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes,
but his common sense had shown him that he
must yield if he would attain his end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I
feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks
amiss. You are justified in getting down to the
facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more
of you for it. I can assure you, however, that the re-
lations between Miss Dunbar and me don&#8217;t really
touch this case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is for me to decide, is it not?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I guess that is so. You&#8217;re like a surgeon
</p>
<p>who wants every symptom before he can give his
diagnosis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a
patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon
who would conceal the facts of his case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be so, but you will admit, Mr.
Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when
they are asked point-blank what their relations
with a woman may be&#8212;if there is really some se-
rious feeling in the case. I guess most men have
a little private reserve of their own in some corner
of their souls where they don&#8217;t welcome intruders.
And you burst suddenly into it. But the object ex-
cuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well,
the stakes are down and the reserve open, and you
can explore where you will. What is it you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth.&#8221;
The Gold King paused for a moment as one
</p>
<p>who marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined
face had become even sadder and more grave.
</p>
<p>926</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he at last. &#8220;There are some things
that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I
won&#8217;t go deeper than is needful. I met my wife
when I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto
was the daughter of a government official at Man-
aos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and
ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back
with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can
see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty.
It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-
hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from
the American women whom I had known. Well,
to make a long story short, I loved her and I
married her. It was only when the romance had
passed&#8212;and it lingered for years&#8212;that I realized
that we had nothing&#8212;absolutely nothing&#8212;in com-
mon. My love faded. If hers had faded also it
might have been easier. But you know the won-
derful way of women! Do what I might, nothing
could turn her from me. If I have been harsh to
her, even brutal as some have said, it has been be-
cause I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it
turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us.
But nothing changed her. She adored me in those
English woods as she had adored me twenty years
ago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might,
she was as devoted as ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered
our advertisement and became governess to our
two children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait
in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed
that she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I
make no pretence to be more moral than my neigh-
bours, and I will admit to you that I could not live
under the same roof with such a woman and in
daily contact with her without feeling a passionate
regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not blame you for feeling it. I should
blame you if you expressed it, since this young
lady was in a sense under your protection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe so,&#8221; said the millionaire, though
for a moment the reproof had brought the old an-
gry gleam into his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m not pretending to
be any better than I am. I guess all my life I&#8217;ve
been a man that reached out his hand for what he
wanted, and I never wanted anything more than
the love and possession of that woman. I told her
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, did you?&#8221;
Holmes could look very formidable when he
</p>
<p>was moved.
&#8220;I said to her that if I could marry her I would,
</p>
<p>but that it was out of my power. I said that money
</p>
<p>was no object and that all I could do to make her
happy and comfortable would be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very generous, I am sure,&#8221; said Holmes with
a sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a
question of evidence, not on a question of morals.
I&#8217;m not asking for your criticism.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only for the young lady&#8217;s sake that I
touch your case at all,&#8221; said Holmes sternly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know that anything she is accused of is re-
ally worse than what you have yourself admitted,
that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who
was under your roof. Some of you rich men have
to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed
into condoning your offences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To my surprise the Gold King took the reproof
with equanimity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I feel myself about it now. I thank
God that my plans did not work out as I intended.
She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave
the house instantly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did she not?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, in the first place, others were dependent
</p>
<p>upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let
them all down by sacrificing her living. When I
had sworn&#8212;as I did&#8212;that she should never be
molested again, she consented to remain. But there
was another reason. She knew the influence she
had over me, and that it was stronger than any
other influence in the world. She wanted to use it
for good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, she knew something of my affairs. They
</p>
<p>are large, Mr. Holmes&#8212;large beyond the belief of
an ordinary man. I can make or break&#8212;and it is
usually break. It wasn&#8217;t individuals only. It was
communities, cities, even nations. Business is a
hard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played
the game for all it was worth. I never squealed my-
self, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed.
But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She
believed and said that a fortune for one man that
was more than he needed should not be built on
ten thousand ruined men who were left without
the means of life. That was how she saw it, and I
guess she could see past the dollars to something
that was more lasting. She found that I listened
to what she said, and she believed she was serv-
ing the world by influencing my actions. So she
stayed&#8212;and then this came along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you throw any light upon that?&#8221;
The Gold King paused for a minute or more,
</p>
<p>his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought.
</p>
<p>927</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem of Thor Bridge
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very black against her. I can&#8217;t deny that.
And women lead an inward life and may do things
beyond the judgment of a man. At first I was so
rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think
she had been led away in some extraordinary fash-
ion that was clean against her usual nature. One
explanation came into my head. I give it to you,
Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no
doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is
a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-
jealousy, and though my wife had no cause&#8212;and
I think she understood this&#8212;for the latter, she was
aware that this English girl exerted an influence
upon my mind and my acts that she herself never
had. It was an influence for good, but that did
not mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred,
and the heat of the Amazon was always in her
blood. She might have planned to murder Miss
Dunbar&#8212;or we will say to threaten her with a gun
and so frighten her into leaving us. Then there
might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off
and shot the woman who held it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That possibility had already occurred to me,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Indeed, it is the only obvious alter-
native to deliberate murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she utterly denies it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is not final&#8212;is it? One can under-
stand that a woman placed in so awful a position
might hurry home still in her bewilderment hold-
ing the revolver. She might even throw it down
among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was
doing, and when it was found she might try to lie
her way out by a total denial, since all explanation
was impossible. What is against such a supposi-
tion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dunbar herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked at his watch. &#8220;I have no doubt
we can get the necessary permits this morning and
reach Winchester by the evening train. When I
have seen this young lady it is very possible that I
may be of more use to you in the matter, though I
cannot promise that my conclusions will necessar-
ily be such as you desire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was some delay in the official pass, and
instead of reaching Winchester that day we went
down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of Mr.
Neil Gibson. He did not accompany us himself,
but we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of
the local police, who had first examined into the
affair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a
secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed
the idea that he knew or suspected a very great
</p>
<p>deal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too,
of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if
he had come upon something of vital importance,
though the information was usually commonplace
enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon
showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who
was not too proud to admit that he was out of his
depth and would welcome any help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;d rather have you than Scotland
Yard, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If the Yard gets called
into a case, then the local loses all credit for suc-
cess and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play
straight, so I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not appear in the matter at all,&#8221; said
Holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy ac-
quaintance. &#8220;If I can clear it up I don&#8217;t ask to have
my name mentioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s very handsome of you, I am sure.
And your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, I
know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to the
place there is one question I should like to ask you.
I&#8217;d breathe it to no soul but you.&#8221; He looked round
as though he hardly dare utter the words. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil
Gibson himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been considering that.&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;ve not seen Miss Dunbar. She is a won-
</p>
<p>derful fine woman in every way. He may well have
wished his wife out of the road. And these Amer-
icans are readier with pistols than our folk are. It
was his pistol, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that clearly made out?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir. It was one of a pair that he had.&#8221;
&#8220;One of a pair? Where is the other?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, the gentleman has a lot of firearms of
</p>
<p>one sort and another. We never quite matched that
particular pistol&#8212;but the box was made for two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was one of a pair you should surely be
able to match it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have them all laid out at the house if
you would care to look them over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Later, perhaps. I think we will walk down to-
gether and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This conversation had taken place in the little
front room of Sergeant Coventry&#8217;s humble cottage
which served as the local police-station. A walk
of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all
gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us
to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor
Place estate. A path led us through the pheasant
preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the
widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and
half Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside
us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the
</p>
<p>928</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>centre where the main carriage drive passed over
a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on ei-
ther side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this
bridge, and he pointed to the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was where Mrs. Gibson&#8217;s body lay. I
marked it by that stone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you were there before it was
moved?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they sent for me at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm
was given and he had rushed down with others
from the house, he insisted that nothing should be
moved until the police should arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was sensible. I gathered from the news-
paper report that the shot was fired from close
quarters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, very close.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Near the right temple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just behind it, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the body lie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the back, sir. No trace of a struggle. No
marks. No weapon. The short note from Miss
Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clutched, you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is of great importance. It excludes the
idea that anyone could have placed the note there
after death in order to furnish a false clue. Dear
me! The note, as I remember, was quite short:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>&#8212; &#8220;G. Dunbar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that not so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was her explanation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. She
would say nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is certainly a very interesting
one. The point of the letter is very obscure, is it
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said the guide, &#8220;it seemed, if I may
be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point
in the whole case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Granting that the letter is genuine and was re-
ally written, it was certainly received some time
before&#8212;say one hour or two. Why, then, was this
lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should
she carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer
to it in the interview. Does it not seem remark-
able?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.&#8221;
&#8220;I think I should like to sit quietly for a few
</p>
<p>minutes and think it out.&#8221; He seated himself upon
the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his
quick gray eyes darting their questioning glances
in every direction. Suddenly he sprang up again
and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped
his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the
stonework.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is curious,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. I expect
</p>
<p>it&#8217;s been done by some passer-by.&#8221;
The stonework was gray, but at this one point
</p>
<p>it showed white for a space not larger than a six-
pence. When examined closely one could see that
the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It took some violence to do that,&#8221; said Holmes
thoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge
several times without leaving a mark. &#8220;Yes, it was
a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not
from above but from below, for you see that it is
on the lower edge of the parapet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. It may
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point
worth noting. I do not think that we have anything
more to learn here. There were no footsteps, you
say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ground was iron hard, sir. There were no
traces at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can go. We will go up to the house
first and look over these weapons of which you
speak. Then we shall get on to Winchester, for
I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go
farther.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town,
but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr. Bates
who had called upon us in the morning. He
showed us with a sinister relish the formidable ar-
ray of firearms of various shapes and sizes which
his employer had accumulated in the course of an
adventurous life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would
expect who knew him and his methods,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer
beside his bed. He is a man of violence, sir, and
there are times when all of us are afraid of him.
</p>
<p>929</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem of Thor Bridge
</p>
<p>I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was
often terrified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever witness physical violence to-
wards her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words
which were nearly as bad&#8212;words of cold, cutting
contempt, even before the servants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our millionaire does not seem to shine in pri-
vate life,&#8221; remarked Holmes as we made our way
to the station. &#8220;Well, Watson, we have come on a
good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet
I seem some way from my conclusion. In spite of
the very evident dislike which Mr. Bates has to his
employer, I gather from him that when the alarm
came he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner
was over at 8.30 and all was normal up to then.
It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the
evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about
the hour named in the note. There is no evidence
at all that Mr. Gibson had been out of doors since
his return from town at five o&#8217;clock. On the other
hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that
she had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gib-
son at the bridge. Beyond this she would say noth-
ing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her
defence. We have several very vital questions to
ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy
until we have seen her. I must confess that the case
would seem to me to be very black against her if it
were not for one thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is that, Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Holmes!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;that seemed to
me to be the most damning incident of all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my
first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now
that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only
firm ground for hope. We must look for consis-
tency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect
deception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly follow you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that
we visualize you in the character of a woman who,
in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get
rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has
been written. The victim has come. You have your
weapon. The crime is done. It has been work-
manlike and complete. Do you tell me that after
carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin
your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling
your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which
would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it
carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe,
</p>
<p>the very first place that would be searched? Your
best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Wat-
son, and yet I could not picture you doing any-
thing so crude as that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the excitement of the moment&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is pos-
sible. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then
the means of covering it are coolly premeditated
also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence
of a serious misconception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is so much to explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we shall set about explaining it. When
once your point of view is changed, the very thing
which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth.
For example, there is this revolver. Miss Dunbar
disclaims all knowledge of it. On our new theory
she is speaking truth when she says so. There-
fore, it was placed in her wardrobe. Who placed
it there? Someone who wished to incriminate her.
Was not that person the actual criminal? You see
how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of
inquiry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were compelled to spend the night at
Winchester, as the formalities had not yet been
completed, but next morning, in the company of
Mr. Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was
entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see
the young lady in her cell. I had expected from all
that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I
can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar pro-
duced upon me. It was no wonder that even the
masterful millionaire had found in her something
more powerful than himself&#8212;something which
could control and guide him. One felt, too, as one
looked at the strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive
face, that even should she be capable of some im-
petuous deed, none the less there was an innate
nobility of character which would make her influ-
ence always for the good. She was a brunette, tall,
with a noble figure and commanding presence, but
her dark eyes had in them the appealing, help-
less expression of the hunted creature who feels
the nets around it, but can see no way out from
the toils. Now, as she realized the presence and
the help of my famous friend, there came a touch
of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope
began to glimmer in the glance which she turned
upon us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you some-
thing of what occurred between us?&#8221; she asked in
a low, agitated voice.
</p>
<p>930</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Holmes answered, &#8220;you need not pain
yourself by entering into that part of the story. Af-
ter seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr. Gib-
son&#8217;s statement both as to the influence which you
had over him and as to the innocence of your rela-
tions with him. But why was the whole situation
not brought out in court?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed to me incredible that such a charge
could be sustained. I thought that if we waited the
whole thing must clear itself up without our being
compelled to enter into painful details of the inner
life of the family. But I understand that far from
clearing it has become even more serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; cried Holmes earnestly,
&#8220;I beg you to have no illusions upon the point.
Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all the
cards are at present against us, and that we must
do everything that is possible if we are to win clear.
It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you
are not in very great danger. Give me all the help
you can, then, to get at the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will conceal nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr.
Gibson&#8217;s wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with
all the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a
woman who would do nothing by halves, and the
measure of her love for her husband was the mea-
sure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that
she misunderstood our relations. I would not wish
to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical
sense that she could hardly understand the mental,
and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to
me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influ-
ence his power to good ends which kept me under
his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing
could justify me in remaining where I was a cause
of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the un-
happiness would have remained even if I had left
the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Dunbar,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;I beg you
to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you the truth so far as I know
it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove
nothing, and there are points&#8212;the most vital
points&#8212;which I can neither explain nor can I
imagine any explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will find the facts, perhaps others may
find the explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard, then, to my presence at Thor
Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gib-
son in the morning. It lay on the table of the
schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her
</p>
<p>own hand. It implored me to see her there after
dinner, said she had something important to say
to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the
sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be
in our confidence. I saw no reason for such secrecy,
but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment.
She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in
the schoolroom grate. She was very much afraid of
her husband, who treated her with a harshness for
which I frequently reproached him, and I could
only imagine that she acted in this way because
she did not wish him to know of our interview.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet she kept your reply very carefully?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in
</p>
<p>her hand when she died.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, what happened then?&#8221;
&#8220;I went down as I had promised. When
</p>
<p>I reached the bridge she was waiting for me.
Never did I realize till that moment how this
poor creature hated me. She was like a mad
woman&#8212;indeed, I think she was a mad woman,
subtly mad with the deep power of deception
which insane people may have. How else could
she have met me with unconcern every day and yet
had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will
not say what she said. She poured her whole wild
fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not
even answer&#8212;I could not. It was dreadful to see
her. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away.
When I left her she was standing, still shrieking
out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where she was afterwards found?&#8221;
&#8220;Within a few yards from the spot.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet, presuming that she met her death
</p>
<p>shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes,
</p>
<p>I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible out-
break that I rushed to get back to the peace of my
own room, and I was incapable of noticing any-
thing which happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that you returned to your room. Did
you leave it again before next morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when the alarm came that the poor crea-
ture had met her death I ran out with the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Mr. Gibson?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, he had just returned from the bridge
</p>
<p>when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and
the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he seem to you much perturbed?&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained
</p>
<p>man. I do not think that he would ever show his
emotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so
well, could see that he was deeply concerned.&#8221;

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem of Thor Bridge
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we come to the all-important point. This
pistol that was found in your room. Had you ever
seen it before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, I swear it.&#8221;
&#8220;When was it found?&#8221;
&#8220;Next morning, when the police made their
</p>
<p>search.&#8221;
&#8220;Among your clothes?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under my
</p>
<p>dresses.&#8221;
&#8220;You could not guess how long it had been
</p>
<p>there?&#8221;
&#8220;It had not been there the morning before.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I tidied out the wardrobe.&#8221;
&#8220;That is final. Then someone came into your
</p>
<p>room and placed the pistol there in order to incul-
pate you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been so.&#8221;
&#8220;And when?&#8221;
&#8220;It could only have been at meal-time, or else
</p>
<p>at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom
with the children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you were when you got the note?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, from that time onward for the whole
</p>
<p>morning.&#8221;
&#8220;Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other
</p>
<p>point which could help me in the investigation?&#8221;
&#8220;I can think of none.&#8221;
&#8220;There was some sign of violence on the
</p>
<p>stonework of the bridge&#8212;a perfectly fresh chip
just opposite the body. Could you suggest any
possible explanation of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it must be a mere coincidence.&#8221;
&#8220;Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. Why
</p>
<p>should it appear at the very time of the tragedy,
and why at the very place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what could have caused it? Only great
violence could have such an effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes did not answer. His pale, eager face
had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away ex-
pression which I had learned to associate with the
supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident
was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared
to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and my-
self, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed
silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrat-
ing with nervous energy and the pressing need for
action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Watson, come!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from
</p>
<p>me, Mr. Cummings. With the help of the god of
justice I will give you a case which will make Eng-
land ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss
Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that
the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope
that the light of truth is breaking through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a long journey from Winchester to
Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience,
while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed
endless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could
not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed
with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions
beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our
destination he seated himself opposite to me&#8212;we
had a first-class carriage to ourselves&#8212;and laying
a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my
eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which
was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have some recollection
that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was as well for him that I did so, for he took
little care for his own safety when his mind was
once absorbed by a problem, so that more than
once my revolver had been a good friend in need.
I reminded him of the fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such
matters. But have you your revolver on you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I produced it from my hip-pocket, a short,
handy, but very serviceable little weapon. He un-
did the catch, shook out the cartridges, and exam-
ined it with care.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heavy&#8212;remarkably heavy,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Yes, it is a solid bit of work.&#8221;
He mused over it for a minute.
&#8220;Do you know, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I believe
</p>
<p>your revolver is going to have a very intimate con-
nection with the mystery which we are investigat-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes, you are joking.&#8221;
&#8220;No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test
</p>
<p>before us. If the test comes off, all will be clear.
And the test will depend upon the conduct of this
little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will
replace the other five and put on the safety-catch.
So! That increases the weight and makes it a better
reproduction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor
did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until
we pulled up in the little Hampshire station. We
secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an
</p>
<p>932</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>hour were at the house of our confidential friend,
the sergeant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Wat-
son&#8217;s revolver,&#8221; said my friend. &#8220;Here it is. Now,
officer, can you give me ten yards of string?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this is all we will need,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Now, if you please, we will get off on
what I hope is the last stage of our journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sun was setting and turning the rolling
Hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal
panorama. The sergeant, with many critical
and incredulous glances, which showed his deep
doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched
along beside us. As we approached the scene of
the crime I could see that my friend under all his
habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said in answer to my remark, &#8220;you
have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have
an instinct for such things, and yet it has some-
times played me false. It seemed a certainty when
first it flashed across my mind in the cell at Winch-
ester, but one drawback of an active mind is that
one can always conceive alternative explanations
which would make our scent a false one. And
yet&#8212;and yet&#8212; Well, Watson, we can but try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he walked he had firmly tied one end of
the string to the handle of the revolver. We had
now reached the scene of the tragedy. With great
care he marked out under the guidance of the po-
liceman the exact spot where the body had been
stretched. He then hunted among the heather and
the ferns until he found a considerable stone. This
he secured to the other end of his line of string,
and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge
so that it swung clear above the water. He then
stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the
edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand,
the string being taut between the weapon and the
heavy stone on the farther side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for it!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>At the words he raised the pistol to his head,
and then let go his grip. In an instant it had
been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had
struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and
had vanished over the side into the water. It had
hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside
the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he
had found what he expected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there ever a more exact demonstration?&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;See, Watson, your revolver has solved
</p>
<p>the problem!&#8221; As he spoke he pointed to a sec-
ond chip of the exact size and shape of the first
which had appeared on the under edge of the
stone balustrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay at the inn to-night,&#8221; he continued
as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. &#8220;You
will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will
easily restore my friend&#8217;s revolver. You will also
find beside it the revolver, string and weight with
which this vindictive woman attempted to dis-
guise her own crime and to fasten a charge of mur-
der upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gib-
son know that I will see him in the morning, when
steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar&#8217;s vindication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Late that evening, as we sat t
