<p>herlock Holmes was in a melancholy
and philosophic mood that morning.
His alert practical nature was subject to
such reactions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see him?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the old fellow who has just gone
out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I met him at the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you think of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pathetic, futile, broken creature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Watson. Pathetic and futile. But is not
all life pathetic and futile? Is not his story a micro-
cosm of the whole? We reach. We grasp. And
what is left in our hands at the end? A shadow.
Or worse than a shadow&#8212;misery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he one of your clients?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I may call him so. He has been
sent on by the Yard. Just as medical men occasion-
ally send their incurables to a quack. They argue
that they can do nothing more, and that whatever
happens the patient can be no worse than he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took a rather soiled card from the table.
&#8220;Josiah Amberley. He says he was junior partner
of Brickfall and Amberley, who are manufacturers
of artistic materials. You will see their names upon
paint-boxes. He made his little pile, retired from
business at the age of sixty-one, bought a house at
Lewisham, and settled down to rest after a life of
ceaseless grind. One would think his future was
tolerably assured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes glanced over some notes which he had
scribbled upon the back of an envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Retired in 1896, Watson. Early in 1897 he
married a woman twenty years younger than him-
self&#8212;a good-looking woman, too, if the photo-
graph does not flatter. A competence, a wife,
leisure&#8212;it seemed a straight road which lay be-
fore him. And yet within two years he is, as you
have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as
crawls beneath the sun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old story, Watson. A treacherous friend
and a fickle wife. It would appear that Amberley
has one hobby in life, and it is chess. Not far from
him at Lewisham there lives a young doctor who
is also a chess-player. I have noted his name as Dr.
Ray Ernest. Ernest was frequently in the house,
and an intimacy between him and Mrs. Amberley
</p>
<p>was a natural sequence, for you must admit that
our unfortunate client has few outward graces,
whatever his inner virtues may be. The couple
went off together last week&#8212;destination untraced.
What is more, the faithless spouse carried off the
old man&#8217;s deed-box as her personal luggage with
a good part of his life&#8217;s savings within. Can we
find the lady? Can we save the money? A com-
monplace problem so far as it has developed, and
yet a vital one for Josiah Amberley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do about it?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, the immediate question, my dear Wat-
</p>
<p>son, happens to be, What will you do?&#8212;if you will
be good enough to understudy me. You know that
I am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic
Patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day. I
really have not time to go out to Lewisham, and
yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value.
The old fellow was quite insistent that I should go,
but I explained my difficulty. He is prepared to
meet a representative.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I confess I don&#8217;t
see that I can be of much service, but I am willing
to do my best.&#8221; And so it was that on a summer
afternoon I set forth to Lewisham, little dreaming
that within a week the affair in which I was engag-
ing would be the eager debate of all England.
</p>
<p>It was late that evening before I returned to
Baker Street and gave an account of my mission.
Holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in his
deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths
of acrid tobacco, while his eyelids drooped over
his eyes so lazily that he might almost have been
asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable
passage of my narrative they half lifted, and two
gray eyes, as bright and keen as rapiers, transfixed
me with their searching glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Haven is the name of Mr. Josiah Amber-
ley&#8217;s house,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;I think it would interest
you, Holmes. It is like some penurious patrician
who has sunk into the company of his inferiors.
You know that particular quarter, the monotonous
brick streets, the weary suburban highways. Right
in the middle of them, a little island of ancient cul-
ture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded
by a high sun-baked wall mottled with lichens and
topped with moss, the sort of wall&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the poetry, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes
severely. &#8220;I note that it was a high brick wall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. I should not have known which was
The Haven had I not asked a lounger who was
smoking in the street. I have a reason for mention-
ing him. He was a tall, dark, heavily moustached,
rather military-looking man. He nodded in answer
</p>
<p>979</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Retired Colourman
</p>
<p>to my inquiry and gave me a curiously question-
ing glance, which came back to my memory a little
later.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hardly entered the gateway before I saw
Mr. Amberley coming down the drive. I only had
a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly
gave me the impression of a strange creature, but
when I saw him in full light his appearance was
even more abnormal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, of course, studied it, and yet I
should be interested to have your impression,&#8221;
said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed to me like a man who was liter-
ally bowed down by care. His back was curved
as though he carried a heavy burden. Yet he was
not the weakling that I had at first imagined, for
his shoulders and chest have the framework of a
giant, though his figure tapers away into a pair of
spindled legs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not observe that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t. I spotted his artificial limb.
But proceed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled
hair which curled from under his old straw hat,
and his face with its fierce, eager expression and
the deeply lined features.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Watson. What did he say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He began pouring out the story of his
grievances. We walked down the drive together,
and of course I took a good look round. I have
never seen a worse-kept place. The garden was all
running to seed, giving me an impression of wild
neglect in which the plants had been allowed to
find the way of Nature rather than of art. How any
decent woman could have tolerated such a state of
things, I don&#8217;t know. The house, too, was slatternly
to the last degree, but the poor man seemed him-
self to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it,
for a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of
the hall, and he was carrying a thick brush in his
left hand. He had been working on the woodwork.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He took me into his dingy sanctum, and we
had a long chat. Of course, he was disappointed
that you had not come yourself. &#8216;I hardly ex-
pected,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that so humble an individual as
myself, especially after my heavy financial loss,
could obtain the complete attention of so famous a
man as Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assured him that the financial question did
not arise. &#8216;No, of course, it is art for art&#8217;s sake
with him,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but even on the artistic side
</p>
<p>of crime he might have found something here to
study. And human nature, Dr. Watson&#8212;the black
ingratitude of it all! When did I ever refuse one of
her requests? Was ever a woman so pampered?
And that young man&#8212;he might have been my
own son. He had the run of my house. And yet
see how they have treated me! Oh, Dr. Watson, it
is a dreadful, dreadful world!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the burden of his song for an hour
or more. He had, it seems, no suspicion of an in-
trigue. They lived alone save for a woman who
comes in by the day and leaves every evening
at six. On that particular evening old Amberley,
wishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two up-
per circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre. At the
last moment she had complained of a headache
and had refused to go. He had gone alone. There
seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he pro-
duced the unused ticket which he had taken for
his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is remarkable&#8212;most remarkable,&#8221; said
Holmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be
rising. &#8220;Pray continue, Watson. I find your narra-
tive most arresting. Did you personally examine
this ticket? You did not, perchance, take the num-
ber?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It so happens that I did,&#8221; I answered with
some pride. &#8220;It chanced to be my old school num-
ber, thirty-one, and so is stuck in my head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! His seat, then, was either
thirty or thirty-two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; I answered with some mystifica-
tion. &#8220;And on B row.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is most satisfactory. What else did he tell
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed me his strong-room, as he called it.
It really is a strong-room&#8212;like a bank&#8212;with iron
door and shutter&#8212;burglar-proof, as he claimed.
However, the woman seems to have had a dupli-
cate key, and between them they had carried off
some seven thousand pounds&#8217; worth of cash and
securities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Securities! How could they dispose of those?&#8221;
&#8220;He said that he had given the police a list
</p>
<p>and that he hoped they would be unsaleable. He
had got back from the theatre about midnight and
found the place plundered, the door and window
open, and the fugitives gone. There was no letter
or message, nor has he heard a word since. He at
once gave the alarm to the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes brooded for some minutes.
&#8220;You say he was painting. What was he paint-
</p>
<p>ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>980</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, he was painting the passage. But he had
already painted the door and woodwork of this
room I spoke of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it not strike you as a strange occupation
in the circumstances?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;One must do something to ease an aching
heart.&#8217; That was his own explanation. It was eccen-
tric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man.
He tore up one of his wife&#8217;s photographs in my
presence&#8212;tore it up furiously in a tempest of pas-
sion. &#8216;I never wish to see her damned face again,&#8217;
he shrieked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything more, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, one thing which struck me more than
anything else. I had driven to the Blackheath Sta-
tion and had caught my train there when, just as
it was starting, I saw a man dart into the carriage
next to my own. You know that I have a quick
eye for faces, Holmes. It was undoubtedly the tall,
dark man whom I had addressed in the street. I
saw him once more at London Bridge, and then I
lost him in the crowd. But I am convinced that he
was following me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt! No doubt!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;A tall,
dark, heavily moustached man, you say, with gray-
tinted sun-glasses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes, you are a wizard. I did not say so,
but he had gray-tinted sun-glasses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a Masonic tie-pin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite simple, my dear Watson. But let us get
down to what is practical. I must admit to you that
the case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly
simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly
assuming a very different aspect. It is true that
though in your mission you have missed every-
thing of importance, yet even those things which
have obtruded themselves upon your notice give
rise to serious thought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I missed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be hurt, my dear fellow. You know
that I am quite impersonal. No one else would
have done better. Some possibly not so well. But
clearly you have missed some vital points. What
is the opinion of the neighbours about this man
Amberley and his wife? That surely is of impor-
tance. What of Dr. Ernest? Was he the gay Lothario
one would expect? With your natural advantages,
Watson, every lady is your helper and accomplice.
What about the girl at the post-office, or the wife
of the greengrocer? I can picture you whispering
</p>
<p>soft nothings with the young lady at the Blue An-
chor, and receiving hard somethings in exchange.
All this you have left undone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can still be done.&#8221;
&#8220;It has been done. Thanks to the telephone and
</p>
<p>the help of the Yard, I can usually get my essentials
without leaving this room. As a matter of fact, my
information confirms the man&#8217;s story. He has the
local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh
and exacting husband. That he had a large sum
of money in that strong-room of his is certain. So
also is it that young Dr. Ernest, an unmarried man,
played chess with Amberley, and probably played
the fool with his wife. All this seems plain sailing,
and one would think that there was no more to be
said&#8212;and yet!&#8212;and yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where lies the difficulty?&#8221;
&#8220;In my imagination, perhaps. Well, leave it
</p>
<p>there, Watson. Let us escape from this weary
workaday world by the side door of music. Ca-
rina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still
have time to dress, dine, and enjoy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the morning I was up betimes, but some
toast crumbs and two empty egg-shells told me
that my companion was earlier still. I found a
scribbled note upon the table.
</p>
<p>Dear Watson:
There are one or two points of con-
</p>
<p>tact which I should wish to establish
with Mr. Josiah Amberley. When I have
done so we can dismiss the case&#8212;or
not. I would only ask you to be on
hand about three o&#8217;clock, as I conceive
it possible that I may want you.
</p>
<p>S. H.
</p>
<p>I saw nothing of Holmes all day, but at the hour
named he returned, grave, preoccupied, and aloof.
At such times it was wiser to leave him to himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Amberley been here yet?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! I am expecting him.&#8221;
He was not disappointed, for presently the old
</p>
<p>fellow arrived with a very worried and puzzled
expression upon his austere face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a telegram, Mr. Holmes. I can make
nothing of it.&#8221; He handed it over, and Holmes read
it aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come at once without fail. Can give
you information as to your recent loss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elman.
&#8220;The Vicarage.
</p>
<p>981</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Retired Colourman
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dispatched at 2.10 from Little Purlington,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Little Purlington is in Essex, I be-
lieve, not far from Frinton. Well, of course you will
start at once. This is evidently from a responsible
person, the vicar of the place. Where is my Crock-
ford? Yes, here we have him: &#8216;J. C. Elman, M. A.,
Living of Moosmoor cum Little Purlington.&#8217; Look
up the trains, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one at 5.20 from Liverpool Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent. You had best go with him, Watson.
He may need help or advice. Clearly we have come
to a crisis in this affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But our client seemed by no means eager to
start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly absurd, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What can this man possibly know of what has
occurred? It is waste of time and money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not have telegraphed to you if he
did not know something. Wire at once that you
are coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes assumed his sternest aspect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would make the worst possible impression
both on the police and upon myself, Mr. Amberley,
if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse
to follow it up. We should feel that you were not
really in earnest in this investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client seemed horrified at the suggestion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I shall go if you look at it in
that way,&#8221; said he. &#8220;On the face of it, it seems ab-
surd to suppose that this person knows anything,
but if you think&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think,&#8221; said Holmes with emphasis, and
so we were launched upon our journey. Holmes
took me aside before we left the room and gave
me one word of counsel, which showed that he
considered the matter to be of importance. &#8220;What-
ever you do, see that he really does go,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Should he break away or return, get to the near-
est telephone exchange and send the single word
&#8216;Bolted.&#8217; I will arrange here that it shall reach me
wherever I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Little Purlington is not an easy place to reach,
for it is on a branch line. My remembrance of the
journey is not a pleasant one, for the weather was
hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and
silent, hardly talking at all save to make an oc-
casional sardonic remark as to the futility of our
proceedings. When we at last reached the little
station it was a two-mile drive before we came to
the Vicarage, where a big, solemn, rather pompous
</p>
<p>clergyman received us in his study. Our telegram
lay before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what can I do
for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We came,&#8221; I explained, &#8220;in answer to your
wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My wire! I sent no wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the wire which you sent to Mr. Josiah
Amberley about his wife and his money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable
one,&#8221; said the vicar angrily. &#8220;I have never heard
of the gentleman you name, and I have not sent a
wire to anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client and I looked at each other in amaze-
ment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps there is some mistake,&#8221; said I; &#8220;are
there perhaps two vicarages? Here is the wire it-
self, signed Elman and dated from the Vicarage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one vicarage, sir, and only one
vicar, and this wire is a scandalous forgery, the ori-
gin of which shall certainly be investigated by the
police. Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in
prolonging this interview.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Mr. Amberley and I found ourselves on the
roadside in what seemed to me to be the most
primitive village in England. We made for the tele-
graph office, but it was already closed. There was a
telephone, however, at the little Railway Arms, and
by it I got into touch with Holmes, who shared in
our amazement at the result of our journey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most singular!&#8221; said the distant voice. &#8220;Most
remarkable! I much fear, my dear Watson, that
there is no return train to-night. I have unwittingly
condemned you to the horrors of a country inn.
However, there is always Nature, Watson&#8212;Nature
and Josiah Amberley&#8212;you can be in close com-
mune with both.&#8221; I heard his dry chuckle as he
turned away.
</p>
<p>It was soon apparent to me that my compan-
ion&#8217;s reputation as a miser was not undeserved.
He had grumbled at the expense of the journey,
had insisted upon travelling third-class, and was
now clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill.
Next morning, when we did at last arrive in Lon-
don, it was hard to say which of us was in the
worse humour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had best take Baker Street as we pass,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Mr. Holmes may have some fresh instruc-
tions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are not worth more than the last ones
they are not of much use, &#8221; said Amberley with a
</p>
<p>982</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>malevolent scowl. None the less, he kept me com-
pany. I had already warned Holmes by telegram
of the hour of our arrival, but we found a mes-
sage waiting that he was at Lewisham and would
expect us there. That was a surprise, but an even
greater one was to find that he was not alone in
the sitting-room of our client. A stern-looking, im-
passive man sat beside him, a dark man with gray-
tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting
from his tie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my friend Mr. Barker,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;He has been interesting himself also in your busi-
ness, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been
working independently. But we both have the
same question to ask you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Amberley sat down heavily. He sensed im-
pending danger. I read it in his straining eyes and
his twitching features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the question, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Only this: What did you do with the bodies?&#8221;
The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse
</p>
<p>scream. He clawed into the air with his bony
hands. His mouth was open, and for the instant
he looked like some horrible bird of prey. In a
flash we got a glimpse of the real Josiah Amber-
ley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as
his body. As he fell back into his chair he clapped
his hand to his lips as if to stifle a cough. Holmes
sprang at his throat like a tiger and twisted his
face towards the ground. A white pellet fell from
between his gasping lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No short cuts, Josiah Amberley. Things must
be done decently and in order. What about it,
Barker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a cab at the door,&#8221; said our taciturn
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only a few hundred yards to the station.
We will go together. You can stay here, Watson. I
shall be back within half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old colourman had the strength of a lion in
that great trunk of his, but he was helpless in the
hands of the two experienced man-handlers. Wrig-
gling and twisting he was dragged to the waiting
cab, and I was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-
omened house. In less time than he had named,
however, Holmes was back, in company with a
smart young police inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left Barker to look after the formalities,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;You had not met Barker, Watson.
He is my hated rival upon the Surrey shore. When
you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me
to complete the picture. He has several good cases
to his credit, has he not, Inspector?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has certainly interfered several times,&#8221; the
inspector answered with reserve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His methods are irregular, no doubt, like
my own. The irregulars are useful sometimes,
you know. You, for example, with your compul-
sory warning about whatever he said being used
against him, could never have bluffed this rascal
into what is virtually a confession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. But we get there all the same, Mr.
Holmes. Don&#8217;t imagine that we had not formed
our own views of this case, and that we would not
have laid our hands on our man. You will excuse
us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods
which we cannot use, and so rob us of the credit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There shall be no such robbery, MacKinnon. I
assure you that I efface myself from now onward,
and as to Barker, he has done nothing save what I
told him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector seemed considerably relieved.
&#8220;That is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>Praise or blame can matter little to you, but it is
very different to us when the newspapers begin to
ask questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. But they are pretty sure to ask ques-
tions anyhow, so it would be as well to have an-
swers. What will you say, for example, when the
intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what
the exact points were which aroused your suspi-
cion, and finally gave you a certain conviction as
to the real facts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector looked puzzled.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t seem to have got any real facts yet,
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes. You say that the prisoner, in the pres-
ence of three witnesses, practically confessed by
trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his
wife and her lover. What other facts have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you arranged for a search?&#8221;
&#8220;There are three constables on their way.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you will soon get the clearest fact of all.
</p>
<p>The bodies cannot be far away. Try the cellars and
the garden. It should not take long to dig up the
likely places. This house is older than the water-
pipes. There must be a disused well somewhere.
Try your luck there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you know of it, and how was it
done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you first how it was done, and then I
will give the explanation which is due to you, and
even more to my long-suffering friend here, who
has been invaluable throughout. But, first, I would
give you an insight into this man&#8217;s mentality. It is a
very unusual one&#8212;so much so that I think his des-
tination is more likely to be Broadmoor than the

</p>
<p>scaffold. He has, to a high degree, the sort of mind
which one associates with the mediaeval Italian
nature rather than with the modern Briton. He was
a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched
by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey
for any adventurer. Such a one came upon the
scene in the person of this chess-playing doctor.
Amberley excelled at chess&#8212;one mark, Watson, of
a scheming mind. Like all misers, he was a jeal-
ous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania.
Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. He
determined to have his revenge, and he planned it
with diabolical cleverness. Come here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes led us along the passage with as much
certainty as if he had lived in the house and halted
at the open door of the strong-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! What an awful smell of paint!&#8221; cried
the inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our first clue,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You
can thank Dr. Watson&#8217;s observation for that,
though he failed to draw the inference. It set my
foot upon the trail. Why should this man at such a
time be filling his house with strong odours? Obvi-
ously, to cover some other smell which he wished
to conceal&#8212;some guilty smell which would sug-
gest suspicions. Then came the idea of a room
such as you see here with iron door and shut-
ter&#8212;a hermetically sealed room. Put those two
facts together, and whither do they lead? I could
only determine that by examining the house my-
self. I was already certain that the case was se-
rious, for I had examined the box-office chart at
the Haymarket Theatre&#8212;another of Dr. Watson&#8217;s
bull&#8217;s-eyes&#8212;and ascertained that neither B thirty
nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occu-
pied that night. Therefore, Amberley had not been
to the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. He
made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend
to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.
The question now arose how I might be able to
examine the house. I sent an agent to the most im-
possible village I could think of, and summoned
my man to it at such an hour that he could not
possibly get back. To prevent any miscarriage, Dr.
Watson accompanied him. The good vicar&#8217;s name
I took, of course, out of my Crockford. Do I make
it all clear to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is masterly,&#8221; said the inspector in an awed
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There being no fear of interruption I pro-
ceeded to burgle the house. Burglary has always
been an alternative profession had I cared to adopt
it, and I have little doubt that I should have come
to the front. Observe what I found. You see the
</p>
<p>gas-pipe along the skirting here. Very good. It
rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here
in the corner. The pipe runs out into the strong-
room, as you can see, and ends in that plaster rose
in the centre of the ceiling, where it is concealed
by the ornamentation. That end is wide open. At
any moment by turning the outside tap the room
could be flooded with gas. With door and shutter
closed and the tap full on I would not give two
minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up
in that little chamber. By what devilish device he
decoyed them there I do not know, but once inside
the door they were at his mercy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector examined the pipe with interest.
&#8220;One of our officers mentioned the smell of gas,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but of course the window and door were
open then, and the paint&#8212;or some of it&#8212;was al-
ready about. He had begun the work of painting
the day before, according to his story. But what
next, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then came an incident which was rather
unexpected to myself. I was slipping through the
pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a
hand inside my collar, and a voice said: &#8216;Now,
you rascal, what are you doing in there?&#8217; When I
could twist my head round I looked into the tinted
spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker. It
was a curious foregathering and set us both smil-
ing. It seems that he had been engaged by Dr. Ray
Ernest&#8217;s family to make some investigations and
had come to the same conclusion as to foul play.
He had watched the house for some days and had
spotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously sus-
picious characters who had called there. He could
hardly arrest Watson, but when he saw a man actu-
ally climbing out of the pantry window there came
a limit to his restraint. Of course, I told him how
matters stood and we continued the case together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why him? Why not us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it was in my mind to put that lit-
tle test which answered so admirably. I fear you
would not have gone so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe not. I understand that I have your
word, Mr. Holmes, that you step right out of the
case now and that you turn all your results over to
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, that is always my custom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the name of the force I thank you. It
seems a clear case, as you put it, and there can&#8217;t be
much difficulty over the bodies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you a grim little bit of evidence,&#8221; said
Holmes, &#8220;and I am sure Amberley himself never
</p>
<p>984</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>observed it. You&#8217;ll get results, Inspector, by al-
ways putting yourself in the other fellow&#8217;s place,
and thinking what you would do yourself. It takes
some imagination, but it pays. Now, we will sup-
pose that you were shut up in this little room, had
not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even
with the fiend who
