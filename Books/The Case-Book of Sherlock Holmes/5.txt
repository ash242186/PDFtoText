<p>olmes had read carefully a note which
the last post had brought him. Then,
with the dry chuckle which was his
nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed
</p>
<p>it over to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a mixture of the modern and the medi-
aeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I
think this is surely the limit,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What do
you make of it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I read as follows:
</p>
<p>46, Old Jewry,
Nov. 19th.
</p>
<p>Re Vampires
Sir:
</p>
<p>Our client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of
Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers,
of Mincing Lane, has made some in-
quiry from us in a communication of
even date concerning vampires. As
our firm specializes entirely upon the
assessment of machinery the matter
hardly comes within our purview, and
we have therefore recommended Mr.
Ferguson to call upon you and lay the
matter before you. We have not forgot-
ten your successful action in the case of
Matilda Briggs.
</p>
<p>We are, sir,
Faithfully yours,
</p>
<p>Morrison, Morrison, and Dodd.
per E. J. C.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young
woman, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes in a reminiscent
voice. &#8220;It was a ship which is associated with the
giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world
is not yet prepared. But what do we know about
vampires? Does it come within our purview ei-
ther? Anything is better than stagnation, but really
we seem to have been switched on to a Grimms&#8217;
fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what
V has to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I leaned back and took down the great index
volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it
on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly and lov-
ingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the
accumulated information of a lifetime.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Voyage of the Gloria Scott,&#8221; he read. &#8220;That was
a bad business. I have some recollection that you
made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable
to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch,
the forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable
case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and
</p>
<p>the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith
wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can&#8217;t
beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hun-
gary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania.&#8221; He
turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a
short intent perusal he threw down the great book
with a snarl of disappointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to
do with walking corpses who can only be held in
their grave by stakes driven through their hearts?
It&#8217;s pure lunacy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the vampire was not nec-
essarily a dead man? A living person might have
the habit. I have read, for example, of the old suck-
ing the blood of the young in order to retain their
youth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend
in one of these references. But are we to give se-
rious attention to such things? This agency stands
flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must re-
main. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts
need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert
Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be
from him and may throw some light upon what is
worrying him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took up a second letter which had lain un-
noticed upon the table while he had been absorbed
with the first. This he began to read with a smile of
amusement upon his face which gradually faded
away into an expression of intense interest and
concentration. When he had finished he sat for
some little time lost in thought with the letter dan-
gling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he
aroused himself from his reverie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheeseman&#8217;s, Lamberley. Where is Lamber-
ley, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in Sussex, south of Horsham.&#8221;
&#8220;Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman&#8217;s?&#8221;
&#8220;I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old
</p>
<p>houses which are named after the men who built
them centuries ago. You get Odley&#8217;s and Harvey&#8217;s
and Carriton&#8217;s&#8212;the folk are forgotten but their
names live in their houses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said Holmes coldly. It was one of
the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained na-
ture that though he docketed any fresh informa-
tion very quietly and accurately in his brain, he
seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. &#8220;I
rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about
Cheeseman&#8217;s, Lamberley, before we are through.
The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Fergu-
son. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With me!&#8221;
&#8220;You had better read it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>903</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire
</p>
<p>He handed the letter across. It was headed with
the address quoted.
</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Holmes [it said]:
I have been recommended to you by
</p>
<p>my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so
extraordinarily delicate that it is most
difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend
for whom I am acting. This gentleman
married some five years ago a Peruvian
lady, the daughter of a Peruvian mer-
chant, whom he had met in connection
with the importation of nitrates. The
lady was very beautiful, but the fact
of her foreign birth and of her alien
religion always caused a separation of
interests and of feelings between hus-
band and wife, so that after a time his
love may have cooled towards her and
he may have come to regard their union
as a mistake. He felt there were sides of
her character which he could never ex-
plore or understand. This was the more
painful as she was as loving a wife as a
man could have&#8212;to all appearance ab-
solutely devoted.
</p>
<p>Now for the point which I will make
more plain when we meet. Indeed,
this note is merely to give you a gen-
eral idea of the situation and to ascer-
tain whether you would care to interest
yourself in the matter. The lady began
to show some curious traits quite alien
to her ordinarily sweet and gentle dis-
position. The gentleman had been mar-
ried twice and he had one son by the
first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a
very charming and affectionate youth,
though unhappily injured through an
accident in childhood. Twice the wife
was caught in the act of assaulting this
poor lad in the most unprovoked way.
Once she struck him with a stick and
left a great weal on his arm.
</p>
<p>This was a small matter, however,
compared with her conduct to her own
child, a dear boy just under one year of
age. On one occasion about a month
ago this child had been left by its nurse
for a few minutes. A loud cry from
the baby, as of pain, called the nurse
back. As she ran into the room she saw
her employer, the lady, leaning over the
baby and apparently biting his neck.
There was a small wound in the neck
</p>
<p>from which a stream of blood had es-
caped. The nurse was so horrified that
she wished to call the husband, but the
lady implored her not to do so and ac-
tually gave her five pounds as a price
for her silence. No explanation was
ever given, and for the moment the
matter was passed over.
</p>
<p>It left, however, a terrible impression
upon the nurse&#8217;s mind, and from that
time she began to watch her mistress
closely and to keep a closer guard upon
the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It
seemed to her that even as she watched
the mother, so the mother watched her,
and that every time she was compelled
to leave the baby alone the mother was
waiting to get at it. Day and night
the nurse covered the child, and day
and night the silent, watchful mother
seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf
waits for a lamb. It must read most in-
credible to you, and yet I beg you to
take it seriously, for a child&#8217;s life and a
man&#8217;s sanity may depend upon it.
</p>
<p>At last there came one dreadful day
when the facts could no longer be con-
cealed from the husband. The nurse&#8217;s
nerve had given way; she could stand
the strain no longer, and she made a
clean breast of it all to the man. To
him it seemed as wild a tale as it may
now seem to you. He knew his wife
to be a loving wife, and, save for the
assaults upon her stepson, a loving
mother. Why, then, should she wound
her own dear little baby? He told the
nurse that she was dreaming, that her
suspicions were those of a lunatic, and
that such libels upon her mistress were
not to be tolerated. While they were
talking a sudden cry of pain was heard.
Nurse and master rushed together to
the nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr.
Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from
a kneeling position beside the cot and
saw blood upon the child&#8217;s exposed
neck and upon the sheet. With a cry
of horror, he turned his wife&#8217;s face to
the light and saw blood all round her
lips. It was she&#8212;she beyond all ques-
tion&#8212;who had drunk the poor baby&#8217;s
blood.
</p>
<p>So the matter stands. She is now con-
fined to her room. There has been no
</p>
<p>904</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>explanation. The husband is half de-
mented. He knows, and I know, little
of vampirism beyond the name. We
had thought it was some wild tale of
foreign parts. And yet here in the very
heart of the English Sussex&#8212;well, all
this can be discussed with you in the
morning. Will you see me? Will you
use your great powers in aiding a dis-
tracted man? If so, kindly wire to Fer-
guson, Cheeseman&#8217;s, Lamberley, and I
will be at your rooms by ten o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
Robert Ferguson.
</p>
<p>P. S. I believe your friend Watson
played Rugby for Blackheath when I
was three-quarter for Richmond. It is
the only personal introduction which I
can give.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I remembered him,&#8221; said I as I laid
down the letter. &#8220;Big Bob Ferguson, the finest
three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always
a good-natured chap. It&#8217;s like him to be so con-
cerned over a friend&#8217;s case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook
his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never get your limits, Watson,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There are unexplored possibilities about you.
Take a wire down, like a good fellow. &#8216;Will ex-
amine your case with pleasure.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your case!&#8221;
&#8220;We must not let him think that this agency is
</p>
<p>a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his
case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Promptly at ten o&#8217;clock next morning Ferguson
strode into our room. I had remembered him as a
long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine
turn of speed which had carried him round many
an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life
more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine ath-
lete whom one has known in his prime. His great
frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and
his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused cor-
responding emotions in him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, Watson,&#8221; said he, and his voice was
still deep and hearty. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look quite the
man you did when I threw you over the ropes
into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I
have changed a bit also. But it&#8217;s this last day or
two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr.
Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be any-
one&#8217;s deputy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is simpler to deal direct,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Of course it is. But you can imagine how diffi-
</p>
<p>cult it is when you are speaking of the one woman
whom you are bound to protect and help. What
can I do? How am I to go to the police with such
a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be pro-
tected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something
in the blood? Have you any similar case in your
experience? For God&#8217;s sake, give me some advice,
for I am at my wit&#8217;s end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here
and pull yourself together and give me a few clear
answers. I can assure you that I am very far from
being at my wit&#8217;s end, and that I am confident we
shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what
steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the
children?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a dreadful scene. She is a most lov-
ing woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a
man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She
was cut to the heart that I should have discovered
this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not
even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches,
save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing
look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and
locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see
me. She has a maid who was with her before her
marriage, Dolores by name&#8212;a friend rather than a
servant. She takes her food to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the child is in no immediate danger?&#8221;
&#8220;Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will
</p>
<p>not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her.
I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I
told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted
by her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But never wounded?&#8221;
&#8220;No, she struck him savagely. It is the more
</p>
<p>terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.&#8221;
Ferguson&#8217;s gaunt features softened as he spoke of
his boy. &#8220;You would think that the dear lad&#8217;s con-
dition would soften anyone&#8217;s heart. A fall in child-
hood and a twisted spine, Mr. Holmes. But the
dearest, most loving heart within.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday
and was reading it over. &#8220;What other inmates are
there in your house, Mr. Ferguson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two servants who have not been long with
us. One stable-hand, Michael, who sleeps in the
house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Do-
lores, and Mrs. Mason. That is all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gather that you did not know your wife well
at the time of your marriage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had only known her a few weeks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>905</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long had this maid Dolores been with
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some years.&#8221;
&#8220;Then your wife&#8217;s character would really be
</p>
<p>better known by Dolores than by you?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, you may say so.&#8221;
Holmes made a note.
&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I may be of more use
</p>
<p>at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for
personal investigation. If the lady remains in her
room, our presence could not annoy or inconve-
nience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.
&#8220;It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes. There is an
</p>
<p>excellent train at two from Victoria if you could
come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we could come. There is a lull at
present. I can give you my undivided energies.
Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are
one or two points upon which I wish to be very
sure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I under-
stand it, has appeared to assault both the children,
her own baby and your little son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so.&#8221;
&#8220;But the assaults take different forms, do they
</p>
<p>not? She has beaten your son.&#8221;
&#8220;Once with a stick and once very savagely with
</p>
<p>her hands.&#8221;
&#8220;Did she give no explanation why she struck
</p>
<p>him?&#8221;
&#8220;None save that she hated him. Again and
</p>
<p>again she said so.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that is not unknown among stepmoth-
</p>
<p>ers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the
lady jealous by nature?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is very jealous&#8212;jealous with all the
strength of her fiery tropical love.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the boy&#8212;he is fifteen, I understand, and
probably very developed in mind, since his body
has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you
no explanation of these assaults?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he declared there was no reason.&#8221;
&#8220;Were they good friends at other times?&#8221;
&#8220;No, there was never any love between them.&#8221;
&#8220;Yet you say he is affectionate?&#8221;
&#8220;Never in the world could there be so devoted
</p>
<p>a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I
say or do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once again Holmes made a note. For some
time he sat lost in thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt you and the boy were great com-
rades before this second marriage. You were
thrown very close together, were you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the boy, having so affectionate a nature,
was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his
mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most devoted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would certainly seem to be a most inter-
esting lad. There is one other point about these as-
saults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and
the assaults upon your son at the same period?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first case it was so. It was as if some
frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage
upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who
suffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make
about the baby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That certainly complicates matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly not. One forms provisional theories
and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode
them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but human na-
ture is weak. I fear that your old friend here has
given an exaggerated view of my scientific meth-
ods. However, I will only say at the present stage
that your problem does not appear to me to be
insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at
Victoria at two o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evening of a dull, foggy November day
when, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lam-
berley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long
winding lane and finally reached the isolated and
ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It
was a large, straggling building, very old in the
centre, very new at the wings with towering Tudor
chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof
of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into
curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch
were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man
after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were
corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the un-
even floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour
of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling
building.
</p>
<p>There was one very large central room into
which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-
fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it
dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid
log fire.
</p>
<p>The room, as I gazed round, was a most sin-
gular mixture of dates and of places. The half-
panelled walls may well have belonged to the
</p>
<p>906</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth cen-
tury. They were ornamented, however, on the
lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-
colours; while above, where yellow plaster took
the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection
of South American utensils and weapons, which
had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady
upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity
which sprang from his eager mind, and examined
them with some care. He returned with his eyes
full of thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Hullo!&#8221;
A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner.
</p>
<p>It came slowly forward towards its master, walk-
ing with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly
and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson&#8217;s
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;The dog. What&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s what puzzled the vet. A sort of paral-
</p>
<p>ysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is pass-
ing. He&#8217;ll be all right soon&#8212;won&#8217;t you, Carlo?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shiver of assent passed through the drooping
tail. The dog&#8217;s mournful eyes passed from one of
us to the other. He knew that we were discussing
his case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it come on suddenly?&#8221;
&#8220;In a single night.&#8221;
&#8220;How long ago?&#8221;
&#8220;It may have been four months ago.&#8221;
&#8220;Very remarkable. Very suggestive.&#8221;
&#8220;What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;A confirmation of what I had already
</p>
<p>thought.&#8221;
&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, what do you think, Mr.
</p>
<p>Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to
you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a
would-be murderer&#8212;my child in constant danger!
Don&#8217;t play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly
serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all
over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson,
whatever the solution may be,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I would
spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the in-
stant, but before I leave this house I hope I may
have something definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please God you may! If you will excuse me,
gentlemen, I will go up to my wife&#8217;s room and see
if there has been any change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was away some minutes, during which
Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosi-
ties upon the wall. When our host returned it was
clear from his downcast face that he had made no
progress. He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-
faced girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tea is ready, Dolores,&#8221; said Ferguson.
&#8220;See that your mistress has everything she can
wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She verra ill,&#8221; cried the girl, looking with in-
dignant eyes at her master. &#8220;She no ask for food.
She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay
alone with her without doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson looked at me with a question in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be so glad if I could be of use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would your mistress see Dr. Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll come with you at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I followed the girl, who was quivering with
strong emotion, up the staircase and down an an-
cient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped
and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it
that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife
he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a
key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks
creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she
swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.
</p>
<p>On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly
in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as
I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beauti-
ful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing
a stranger, she appeared to be relieved and sank
back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to
her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still
while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were
high, and yet my impression was that the condi-
tion was rather that of mental and nervous excite-
ment than of any actual seizure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She lie like that one day, two day. I &#8217;fraid she
die,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>The woman turned her flushed and handsome
face towards me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is my husband?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is below and would wish to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not see him. I will not see him.&#8221; Then
she seemed to wander off into delirium. &#8220;A fiend!
A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you in any way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. No one can help. It is finished. All is
destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The woman must have some strange delusion.
I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the charac-
ter of fiend or devil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; I said, &#8220;your husband loves you
dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do
I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than
break his dear heart? That is how I love him. And
yet he could think of me&#8212;he could speak of me
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he cannot understand. But he should
trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not see him?&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words
nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go
now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only
one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my
child. That is the only message I can send him.&#8221;
She turned her face to the wall and would say no
more.
</p>
<p>I returned to the room downstairs, where Fer-
guson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson
listened moodily to my account of the interview.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I send her the child?&#8221; he said. &#8220;How
do I know what strange impulse might come upon
her? How can I ever forget how she rose from
beside it with its blood upon her lips?&#8221; He shud-
dered at the recollection. &#8220;The child is safe with
Mrs. Mason, and there he must remain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A smart maid, the only modern thing which
we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea.
As she was serving it the door opened and a youth
entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-
faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes
which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and
joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed for-
ward and threw his arms round his neck with the
abandon of a loving girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I did not know that
you were due yet. I should have been here to meet
you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the
embrace with some little show of embarrassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old chap,&#8221; said he, patting the flaxen
head with a very tender hand. &#8220;I came early be-
cause my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson,
have been persuaded to come down and spend an
evening with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
The youth looked at us with a very penetrating
</p>
<p>and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.
&#8220;What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>asked Holmes. &#8220;Might we make the acquaintance
of the baby?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,&#8221; said
Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, sham-
bling gait which told my surgical eyes that he
was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he re-
turned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman
bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-
eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the
Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently de-
voted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled
it most tenderly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,&#8221;
he muttered as he glanced down at the small, an-
gry red pucker upon the cherub throat.
</p>
<p>It was at this moment that I chanced to glance
at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in
his expression. His face was as set as if it had been
carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had
glanced for a moment at father and child, were
now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at
the other side of the room. Following his gaze I
could only guess that he was looking out through
the window at the melancholy, dripping garden.
It is true that a shutter had half closed outside
and obstructed the view, but none the less it was
certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing
his concentrated attention. Then he smiled, and
his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby
neck there was this small puckered mark. Without
speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally
he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in
front of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, little man. You have made a
strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have
a word with you in private.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few
minutes. I only heard the last words, which were:
&#8220;Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.&#8221;
The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind
of creature, withdrew with the child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is Mrs. Mason like?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;Not very prepossessing externally, as you can
</p>
<p>see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you like her, Jack?&#8221; Holmes turned sud-
</p>
<p>denly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face
shadowed over, and he shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,&#8221; said
Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. &#8220;Luckily
I am one of his likes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>908</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his
father&#8217;s breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away, little Jacky,&#8221; said he, and he
watched his son with loving eyes until he disap-
peared. &#8220;Now, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he continued when
the boy was gone, &#8220;I really feel that I have brought
you on a fool&#8217;s errand, for what can you possibly
do save give me your sympathy? It must be an
exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your
point of view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly delicate,&#8221; said my friend with
an amused smile, &#8220;but I have not been struck up
to now with its complexity. It has been a case for
intellectual deduction, but when this original in-
tellectual deduction is confirmed point by point
by quite a number of independent incidents, then
the subjective becomes objective and we can say
confidently that we have reached our goal. I had,
in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and
the rest has merely been observation and confir-
mation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed fore-
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, Holmes,&#8221; he said hoarsely;
&#8220;if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep
me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do?
I care nothing as to how you have found your facts
so long as you have really got them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you
shall have it. But you will permit me to handle
the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of
seeing us, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is ill, but she is quite rational.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. It is only in her presence that we
can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She will not see me,&#8221; cried Ferguson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she will,&#8221; said Holmes. He scribbled
a few lines upon a sheet of paper. &#8220;You at least
have the entree, Watson. Will you have the good-
ness to give the lady this note?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I ascended again and handed the note to Do-
lores, who cautiously opened the door. A mi
