<p>t may have been a comedy, or it may have
been a tragedy. It cost one man his rea-
son, it cost me a blood-letting, and it
cost yet another man the penalties of the
</p>
<p>law. Yet there was certainly an element of comedy.
Well, you shall judge for yourselves.
</p>
<p>I remember the date very well, for it was in
the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood
for services which may perhaps some day be de-
scribed. I only refer to the matter in passing, for in
my position of partner and confidant I am obliged
to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscre-
tion. I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix
the date, which was the latter end of June, 1902,
shortly after the conclusion of the South African
War. Holmes had spent several days in bed, as
was his habit from time to time, but he emerged
that morning with a long foolscap document in his
hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere
gray eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a chance for you to make some
money, friend Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Have you ever
heard the name of Garrideb?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I admitted that I had not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you can lay your hand upon a Gar-
rideb, there&#8217;s money in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a long story&#8212;rather a whimsical
one, too. I don&#8217;t think in all our explorations
of human complexities we have ever come upon
anything more singular. The fellow will be here
presently for cross-examination, so I won&#8217;t open
the matter up till he comes. But, meanwhile, that&#8217;s
the name we want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The telephone directory lay on the table beside
me, and I turned over the pages in a rather hope-
less quest. But to my amazement there was this
strange name in its due place. I gave a cry of tri-
umph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, Holmes! Here it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took the book from my hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Garrideb, N.,&#8217; &#8221; he read, &#8220; &#8216;136 Little Ryder
Street, W.&#8217; Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Wat-
son, but this is the man himself. That is the ad-
dress upon his letter. We want another to match
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson had come in with a card upon a
tray. I took it up and glanced at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, here it is!&#8221; I cried in amazement. &#8220;This
is a different initial. John Garrideb, Counsellor at
Law, Moorville, Kansas, U. S. A.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled as he looked at the card. &#8220;I am
afraid you must make yet another effort, Watson,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;This gentleman is also in the plot al-
ready, though I certainly did not expect to see him
this morning. However, he is in a position to tell
us a good deal which I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later he was in the room. Mr. John
Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful
man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face char-
acteristic of so many American men of affairs. The
general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so
that one received the impression of quite a young
man with a broad set smile upon his face. His
eyes, however, were arresting. Seldom in any hu-
man head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more
intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so
responsive to every change of thought. His accent
was American, but was not accompanied by any
eccentricity of speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes?&#8221; he asked, glancing from one to
the other. &#8220;Ah, yes! Your pictures are not unlike
you, sir, if I may say so. I believe you have had
a letter from my namesake, Mr. Nathan Garrideb,
have you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;We
shall, I fancy, have a good deal to discuss.&#8221; He took
up his sheets of foolscap. &#8220;You are, of course, the
Mr. John Garrideb mentioned in this document.
But surely you have been in England some time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; I seemed
to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your whole outfit is English.&#8221;
Mr. Garrideb forced a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read of your
</p>
<p>tricks, Mr. Holmes, but I never thought I would be
the subject of them. Where do you read that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your
boots&#8212;could anyone doubt it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, I had no idea I was so obvious a
Britisher. But business brought me over here some
time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is nearly all
London. However, I guess your time is of value,
and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my
socks. What about getting down to that paper you
hold in your hand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor,
whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience! Patience, Mr. Garrideb!&#8221; said my
friend in a soothing voice. &#8220;Dr. Watson would tell
you that these little digressions of mine sometimes
prove in the end to have some bearing on the mat-
ter. But why did Mr. Nathan Garrideb not come
with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>913</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he ever drag you into it at all?&#8221;
asked our visitor with a sudden outflame of anger.
&#8220;What in thunder had you to do with it? Here was
a bit of professional business between two gentle-
men, and one of them must needs call in a detec-
tive! I saw him this morning, and he told me this
fool-trick he had played me, and that&#8217;s why I am
here. But I feel bad about it, all the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no reflection upon you, Mr. Gar-
rideb. It was simply zeal upon his part to gain
your end&#8212;an end which is, I understand, equally
vital for both of you. He knew that I had means
of getting information, and, therefore, it was very
natural that he should apply to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor&#8217;s angry face gradually cleared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that puts it different,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When I
went to see him this morning and he told me he
had sent to a detective, I just asked for your ad-
dress and came right away. I don&#8217;t want police
butting into a private matter. But if you are con-
tent just to help us find the man, there can be no
harm in that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is just how it stands,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;And now, sir, since you are here, we had best have
a clear account from your own lips. My friend here
knows nothing of the details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly
a gaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Need he know?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We usually work together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no reason it should be kept a se-
cret. I&#8217;ll give you the facts as short as I can make
them. If you came from Kansas I would not need
to explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Gar-
rideb was. He made his money in real estate,
and afterwards in the wheat pit at Chicago, but he
spent it in buying up as much land as would make
one of your counties, lying along the Arkansas
River, west of Fort Dodge. It&#8217;s grazing-land
and lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-
land, and just every sort of land that brings dollars
to the man that owns it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had no kith nor kin&#8212;or, if he had, I never
heard of it. But he took a kind of pride in the
queerness of his name. That was what brought us
together. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day
I had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled
to death to meet another man with his own name.
It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find
out if there were any more Garridebs in the world.
&#8216;Find me another!&#8217; said he. I told him I was a busy
man and could not spend my life hiking round the
world in search of Garridebs. &#8216;None the less,&#8217; said
</p>
<p>he, &#8216;that is just what you will do if things pan out
as I planned them.&#8217; I thought he was joking, but
there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words,
as I was soon to discover.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For he died within a year of saying them, and
he left a will behind him. It was the queerest will
that has ever been filed in the State of Kansas. His
property was divided into three parts, and I was to
have one on condition that I found two Garridebs
who would share the remainder. It&#8217;s five million
dollars for each if it is a cent, but we can&#8217;t lay a
finger on it until we all three stand in a row.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was so big a chance that I just let my le-
gal practice slide and I set forth looking for Gar-
ridebs. There is not one in the United States. I
went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and
never a Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the
old country. Sure enough there was the name in
the London telephone directory. I went after him
two days ago and explained the whole matter to
him. But he is a lone man, like myself, with some
women relations, but no men. It says three adult
men in the will. So you see we still have a vacancy,
and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready
to pay your charges.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes with a smile, &#8220;I
said it was rather whimsical, did I not? I should
have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to
advertise in the agony columns of the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done that, Mr. Holmes. No replies.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me! Well, it is certainly a most curi-
</p>
<p>ous little problem. I may take a glance at it in
my leisure. By the way, it is curious that you
should have come from Topeka. I used to have a
correspondent&#8212;he is dead now&#8212;old Dr. Lysander
Starr, who was mayor in 1890.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Dr. Starr!&#8221; said our visitor. &#8220;His
name is still honoured. Well, Mr. Holmes, I sup-
pose all we can do is to report to you and let
you know how we progress. I reckon you will
hear within a day or two.&#8221; With this assurance our
American bowed and departed.
</p>
<p>Holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some
time with a curious smile upon his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked at last.
&#8220;I am wondering, Watson&#8212;just wondering!&#8221;
&#8220;At what?&#8221;
Holmes took his pipe from his lips.
&#8220;I was wondering, Watson, what on earth
</p>
<p>could be the object of this man in telling us such a
rigmarole of lies. I nearly asked him so&#8212;for there
are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best
policy&#8212;but I judged it better to let him think he
had fooled us. Here is a man with an English
</p>
<p>914</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the
knee with a year&#8217;s wear, and yet by this document
and by his own account he is a provincial Ameri-
can lately landed in London. There have been no
advertisements in the agony columns. You know
that I miss nothing there. They are my favourite
covert for putting up a bird, and I would never
have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. I
never knew a Dr. Lysander Starr, of Topeka. Touch
him where you would he was false. I think the
fellow is really an American, but he has worn his
accent smooth with years of London. What is his
game, then, and what motive lies behind this pre-
posterous search for Garridebs? It&#8217;s worth our at-
tention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is
certainly a complex and ingenious one. We must
now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud
also. Just ring him up, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at
the other end of the line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I am Mr. Nathan Garrideb. Is Mr.
Holmes there? I should very much like to have a
word with Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend took the instrument and I heard the
usual syncopated dialogue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has been here. I understand that you
don&#8217;t know him. . . . How long? . . . Only two
days! . . . Yes, yes, of course, it is a most captivat-
ing prospect. Will you be at home this evening?
I suppose your namesake will not be there? . . .
Very good, we will come then, for I would rather
have a chat without him. . . . Dr. Watson will come
with me. . . . I understand from your note that
you did not go out often. . . . Well, we shall be
round about six. You need not mention it to the
American lawyer. . . . Very good. Good-bye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and
even Little Ryder Street, one of the smaller off-
shoots from the Edgware Road, within a stone-cast
of old Tyburn Tree of evil memory, looked golden
and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting
sun. The particular house to which we were di-
rected was a large, old-fashioned, Early Georgian
edifice, with a flat brick face broken only by two
deep bay windows on the ground floor. It was on
this ground floor that our client lived, and, indeed,
the low windows proved to be the front of the
huge room in which he spent his waking hours.
Holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass
plate which bore the curious name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up some years, Watson,&#8221; he remarked, indi-
cating its discoloured surface. &#8220;It&#8217;s his real name,
anyhow, and that is something to note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house had a common stair, and there were
a number of names painted in the hall, some indi-
cating offices and some private chambers. It was
not a collection of residential flats, but rather the
abode of Bohemian bachelors. Our client opened
the door for us himself and apologized by saying
that the woman in charge left at four o&#8217;clock. Mr.
Nathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-
jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald,
some sixty-odd years of age. He had a cadaverous
face, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom
exercise was unknown. Large round spectacles
and a small projecting goat&#8217;s beard combined with
his stooping attitude to give him an expression of
peering curiosity. The general effect, however, was
amiable, though eccentric.
</p>
<p>The room was as curious as its occupant. It
looked like a small museum. It was both broad
and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round,
crowded with specimens, geological and anatom-
ical. Cases of butterflies and moths flanked each
side of the entrance. A large table in the centre was
littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass
tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among
them. As I glanced round I was surprised at the
universality of the man&#8217;s interests. Here was a case
of ancient coins. There was a cabinet of flint instru-
ments. Behind his central table was a large cup-
board of fossil bones. Above was a line of plaster
skulls with such names as &#8220;Neanderthal,&#8221; &#8220;Hei-
delberg,&#8221; &#8220;Cro-Magnon&#8221; printed beneath them. It
was clear that he was a student of many subjects.
As he stood in front of us now, he held a piece of
chamois leather in his right hand with which he
was polishing a coin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Syracusan&#8212;of the best period,&#8221; he explained,
holding it up. &#8220;They degenerated greatly towards
the end. At their best I hold them supreme, though
some prefer the Alexandrian school. You will find
a chair here, Mr. Holmes. Pray allow me to clear
these bones. And you, sir&#8212;ah, yes, Dr. Watson&#8212;if
you would have the goodness to put the Japanese
vase to one side. You see round me my little in-
terests in life. My doctor lectures me about never
going out, but why should I go out when I have
so much to hold me here? I can assure you that
the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets
would take me three good months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked round him with curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you tell me that you never go out?&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now and again I drive down to Sotheby&#8217;s
or Christie&#8217;s. Otherwise I very seldom leave my
room. I am not too strong, and my researches are
</p>
<p>915</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs
</p>
<p>very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes,
what a terrific shock&#8212;pleasant but terrific&#8212;it was
for me when I heard of this unparalleled good for-
tune. It only needs one more Garrideb to complete
the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a
brother, but he is dead, and female relatives are
disqualified. But there must surely be others in the
world. I had heard that you handled strange cases,
and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this
American gentleman is quite right, and I should
have taken his advice first, but I acted for the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you acted very wisely indeed,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;But are you really anxious to acquire an
estate in America?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, sir. Nothing would induce me
to leave my collection. But this gentleman has as-
sured me that he will buy me out as soon as we
have established our claim. Five million dollars
was the sum named. There are a dozen specimens
in the market at the present moment which fill
gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to
purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. Just
think what I could do with five million dollars.
Why, I have the nucleus of a national collection. I
shall be the Hans Sloane of my age.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles.
It was very clear that no pains would be spared by
Mr. Nathan Garrideb in finding a namesake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I merely called to make your acquaintance,
and there is no reason why I should interrupt your
studies,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I prefer to establish per-
sonal touch with those with whom I do business.
There are few questions I need ask, for I have your
very clear narrative in my pocket, and I filled up
the blanks when this American gentleman called. I
understand that up to this week you were unaware
of his existence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. He called last Tuesday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you of our interview to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he came straight back to me. He had been
very angry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he be angry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed to think it was some reflection on
his honour. But he was quite cheerful again when
he returned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he suggest any course of action?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, he did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he had, or asked for, any money from
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see no possible object he has in view?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None, except what he states.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you tell him of our telephone appoint-
</p>
<p>ment?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, I did.&#8221;
Holmes was lost in thought. I could see that he
</p>
<p>was puzzled.
&#8220;Have you any articles of great value in your
</p>
<p>collection?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir. I am not a rich man. It is a good
</p>
<p>collection, but not a very valuable one.&#8221;
&#8220;You have no fear of burglars?&#8221;
&#8220;Not the least.&#8221;
&#8220;How long have you been in these rooms?&#8221;
&#8220;Nearly five years.&#8221;
Holmes&#8217;s cross-examination was interrupted
</p>
<p>by an imperative knocking at the door. No sooner
had our client unlatched it than the American
lawyer burst excitedly into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are!&#8221; he cried, waving a paper over
his head. &#8220;I thought I should be in time to get
you. Mr. Nathan Garrideb, my congratulations!
You are a rich man, sir. Our business is happily
finished and all is well. As to you, Mr. Holmes, we
can only say we are sorry if we have given you any
useless trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed over the paper to our client, who
stood staring at a marked advertisement. Holmes
and I leaned forward and read it over his shoulder.
This is how it ran:
</p>
<p>Howard Garrideb
Constructor of Agricultural Machinery
</p>
<p>Binders, reapers, steam and hand plows, drills,
harrows, farmers&#8217; carts, buckboards, and all other
</p>
<p>appliances.
Estimates for Artesian Wells
</p>
<p>Apply Grosvenor Buildings, Aston
&#8220;Glorious!&#8221; gasped our host. &#8220;That makes our
third man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had opened up inquiries in Birmingham,&#8221;
said the American, &#8220;and my agent there has sent
me this advertisement from a local paper. We must
hustle and put the thing through. I have written to
this man and told him that you will see him in his
office to-morrow afternoon at four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to see him?&#8221;
&#8220;What do you say, Mr. Holmes? Don&#8217;t you
</p>
<p>think it would be wiser? Here am I, a wander-
ing American with a wonderful tale. Why should
he believe what I tell him? But you are a Britisher
with solid references, and he is bound to take no-
tice of what you say. I would go with you if you
wished, but I have a very busy day to-morrow, and
</p>
<p>916</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I could always follow you if you are in any trou-
ble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have not made such a journey for
years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing, Mr. Garrideb. I have figured out
our connections. You leave at twelve and should
be there soon after two. Then you can be back the
same night. All you have to do is to see this man,
explain the matter, and get an affidavit of his exis-
tence. By the Lord!&#8221; he added hotly, &#8220;considering
I&#8217;ve come all the way from the centre of America,
it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles
in order to put this matter through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I think what this
gentleman says is very true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Nathan Garrideb shrugged his shoulders
with a disconsolate air. &#8220;Well, if you insist I shall
go,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is certainly hard for me to refuse
you anything, considering the glory of hope that
you have brought into my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that is agreed,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;and no
doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to that,&#8221; said the American. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
added, looking at his watch, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get on.
I&#8217;ll call to-morrow, Mr. Nathan, and see you off to
Birmingham. Coming my way, Mr. Holmes? Well,
then, good-bye, and we may have good news for
you to-morrow night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I noticed that my friend&#8217;s face cleared when the
American left the room, and the look of thoughtful
perplexity had vanished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could look over your collection, Mr.
Garrideb,&#8221; said he. &#8220;In my profession all sorts
of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of
yours is a storehouse of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client shone with pleasure and his eyes
gleamed from behind his big glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had always heard, sir, that you were a very
intelligent man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I could take you round
now if you have the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I have not. But these speci-
mens are so well labelled and classified that they
hardly need your personal explanation. If I should
be able to look in to-morrow, I presume that there
would be no objection to my glancing over them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all. You are most welcome. The place
will, of course, be shut up, but Mrs. Saunders is in
the basement up to four o&#8217;clock and would let you
in with her key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, I happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon.
If you would say a word to Mrs. Saunders it would
</p>
<p>be quite in order. By the way, who is your house-
agent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client was amazed at the sudden question.
&#8220;Holloway and Steele, in the Edgware Road.
</p>
<p>But why?&#8221;
&#8220;I am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it
</p>
<p>comes to houses,&#8221; said Holmes, laughing. &#8220;I was
wondering if this was Queen Anne or Georgian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Georgian, beyond doubt.&#8221;
&#8220;Really. I should have thought a little earlier.
</p>
<p>However, it is easily ascertained. Well, good-bye,
Mr. Garrideb, and may you have every success in
your Birmingham journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house-agent&#8217;s was close by, but we found
that it was closed for the day, so we made our way
back to Baker Street. It was not till after dinner
that Holmes reverted to the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our little problem draws to a close,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;No doubt you have outlined the solution in your
own mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make neither head nor tail of it.&#8221;
&#8220;The head is surely clear enough and the tail
</p>
<p>we should see to-morrow. Did you notice nothing
curious about that advertisement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that the word &#8216;plough&#8217; was misspelt.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, you did notice that, did you? Come, Wat-
</p>
<p>son, you improve all the time. Yes, it was bad En-
glish but good American. The printer had set it up
as received. Then the buckboards. That is Amer-
ican also. And artesian wells are commoner with
them than with us. It was a typical American ad-
vertisement, but purporting to be from an English
firm. What do you make of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only suppose that this American lawyer
put it in himself. What his object was I fail to un-
derstand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there are alternative explanations. Any-
how, he wanted to get this good old fossil up to
Birmingham. That is very clear. I might have
told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose
chase, but, on second thoughts, it seemed better
to clear the stage by letting him go. To-morrow,
Watson&#8212;well, to-morrow will speak for itself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was up and out early. When he re-
turned at lunchtime I noticed that his face was very
grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a more serious matter than I had ex-
pected, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is fair to tell you so,
though I know it will only be an additional reason
to you for running your head into danger. I should
know my Watson by now. But there is danger, and
you should know it.&#8221;

</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is not the first we have shared,
Holmes. I hope it may not be the last. What is
the particular danger this time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are up against a very hard case. I have
identified Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law.
He is none other than &#8216;Killer&#8217; Evans, of sinister and
murderous reputation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear I am none the wiser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it is not part of your profession to carry
about a portable Newgate Calendar in your mem-
ory. I have been down to see friend Lestrade at the
Yard. There may be an occasional want of imagina-
tive intuition down there, but they lead the world
for thoroughness and method. I had an idea that
we might get on the track of our American friend
in their records. Sure enough, I found his chubby
face smiling up at me from the rogues&#8217; portrait
gallery. &#8216;James Winter, alias Morecroft, alias Killer
Evans,&#8217; was the inscription below.&#8221; Holmes drew
an envelope from his pocket. &#8220;I scribbled down a
few points from his dossier: Aged forty-four. Na-
tive of Chicago. Known to have shot three men in
the States. Escaped from penitentiary through po-
litical influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot
a man over cards in a night-club in the Water-
loo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he was
shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead
man was identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as
forger and coiner in Chicago. Killer Evans released
in 1901. Has been under police supervision since,
but so far as known has led an honest life. Very
dangerous man, usually carries arms and is pre-
pared to use them. That is our bird, Watson&#8212;a
sporting bird, as you must admit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is his game?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to
the house-agent&#8217;s. Our client, as he told us, has
been there five years. It was unlet for a year be-
fore then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at
large named Waldron. Waldron&#8217;s appearance was
well remembered at the office. He had suddenly
vanished and nothing more been heard of him.
He was a tall, bearded man with very dark fea-
tures. Now, Prescott, the man whom Killer Evans
had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard, a tall,
dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis,
I think we may take it that Prescott, the American
criminal, used to live in the very room which our
innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at
last we get a link, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the next link?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we must go now and look for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took a revolver from the drawer and handed
it to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild
West friend tries to live up to his nickname, we
must be ready for him. I&#8217;ll give you an hour for a
siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for
our Ryder Street adventure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was just four o&#8217;clock when we reached the
curious apartment of Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saun-
ders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had
no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut
with a spring lock, and Holmes promised to see
that all was safe before we left. Shortly afterwards
the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow
window, and we knew that we were alone in the
lower floor of the house. Holmes made a rapid
examination of the premises. There was one cup-
board in a dark corner which stood out a little
from the wall. It was behind this that we eventu-
ally crouched while Holmes in a whisper outlined
his intentions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to get our amiable friend out of
his room&#8212;that is very clear, and, as the collector
never went out, it took some planning to do it. The
whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently
for no other end. I must say, Watson, that there
is a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the
queer name of the tenant did give him an opening
which he could hardly have expected. He wove his
plot with remarkable cunning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did he want?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that is what we are here to find out. It
</p>
<p>has nothing whatever to do with our client, so far
as I can read the situation. It is something con-
nected with the man he murdered&#8212;the man who
may have been his confederate in crime. There
is some guilty secret in the room. That is how
I read it. At first I thought our friend might
have something in his collection more valuable
than he knew&#8212;something worth the attention of
a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger Prescott of
evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some
deeper reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess
our souls in patience and see what the hour may
bring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That hour was not long in striking. We
crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the
outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp,
metallic snap of a key, and the American was in
the room. He closed the door softly behind him,
took a sharp glance around him to see that all was
safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the
central tab
