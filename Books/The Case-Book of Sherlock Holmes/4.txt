</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div>
</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>don&#8217;t think that any of my adventures
with Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened quite
so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that
which I associate with The Three Gables.
</p>
<p>I had not seen Holmes for some days and had no
idea of the new channel into which his activities
had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that
morning, however, and had just settled me into the
well-worn low armchair on one side of the fire,
while he had curled down with his pipe in his
mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor
arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it
would give a clearer impression of what occurred.
</p>
<p>The door had flown open and a huge negro
had burst into the room. He would have been a
comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was
dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a flow-
ing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flat-
tened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark
eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them,
turned from one of us to the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which of you gen&#8217;l&#8217;men is Masser Holmes?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221; said our visitor, coming
with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle
of the table. &#8220;See here, Masser Holmes, you keep
your hands out of other folks&#8217; business. Leave
folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser
Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on talking,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s fine, is it?&#8221; growled the savage. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a
bit. I&#8217;ve handled your kind before now, and they
didn&#8217;t look fine when I was through with them.
Look at that, Masser Holmes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist un-
der my friend&#8217;s nose. Holmes examined it closely
with an air of great interest. &#8220;Were you born so?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Or did it come by degrees?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It may have been the icy coolness of my friend,
or it may have been the slight clatter which I made
as I picked up the poker. In any case, our visitor&#8217;s
manner became less flamboyant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve given you fair warnin&#8217;,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a friend that&#8217;s interested out Harrow
way&#8212;you know what I&#8217;m meaning&#8212;and he don&#8217;t
intend to have no buttin&#8217; in by you. Got that? You
ain&#8217;t the law, and I ain&#8217;t the law either, and if you
come in I&#8217;ll be on hand also. Don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to meet you for some time,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;I won&#8217;t ask you to sit down, for I don&#8217;t
</p>
<p>like the smell of you, but aren&#8217;t you Steve Dixie,
the bruiser?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name, Masser Holmes, and you&#8217;ll
get put through it for sure if you give me any lip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly the last thing you need,&#8221; said
Holmes, staring at our visitor&#8217;s hideous mouth.
&#8220;But it was the killing of young Perkins outside
the Holborn Bar&#8212; What! you&#8217;re not going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The negro had sprung back, and his face was
leaden. &#8220;I won&#8217;t listen to no such talk,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;What have I to do with this &#8217;ere Perkins, Masser
Holmes? I was trainin&#8217; at the Bull Ring in Birming-
ham when this boy done gone get into trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching you and Barney
Stockdale&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s enough. Get out of it. I&#8217;ll pick you up
</p>
<p>when I want you.&#8221;
&#8220;Good-mornin&#8217;, Masser Holmes. I hope there
</p>
<p>ain&#8217;t no hard feelin&#8217;s about this &#8217;ere visit?&#8221;
&#8220;There will be unless you tell me who sent
</p>
<p>you.&#8221;
&#8220;Why, there ain&#8217;t no secret about that, Masser
</p>
<p>Holmes. It was that same gen&#8217;l&#8217;man that you have
just done gone mention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who set him on to it?&#8221;
&#8220;S&#8217;elp me. I don&#8217;t know, Masser Holmes. He
</p>
<p>just say, &#8216;Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell
him his life ain&#8217;t safe if he go down Harrow way.&#8217;
That&#8217;s the whole truth.&#8221; Without waiting for any
further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the
room almost as precipitately as he had entered.
Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a
quiet chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you were not forced to break his
woolly head, Watson. I observed your manoeuvres
with the poker. But he is really rather a harmless
fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby,
and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one of
the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some
dirty work of late which I may clear up when I
have time. His immediate principal, Barney, is a
more astute person. They specialize in assaults,
intimidation, and the like. What I want to know
is, who is at the back of them on this particular
occasion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do they want to intimidate you?&#8221;
&#8220;It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me
</p>
<p>to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone&#8217;s
while to take so much trouble, there must be some-
thing in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>893</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Gables
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to tell you when we had this
comic interlude. Here is Mrs. Maberley&#8217;s note. If
you care to come with me we will wire her and go
out at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes [I read]:
I have had a succession of strange in-
</p>
<p>cidents occur to me in connection with
this house, and I should much value
your advice. You would find me at
home any time to-morrow. The house
is within a short walk of the Weald Sta-
tion. I believe that my late husband,
Mortimer Maberley, was one of your
early clients.
</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
Mary Maberley
</p>
<p>The address was &#8220;The Three Gables, Harrow
Weald.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s that!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;And now, if you
can spare the time, Watson, we will get upon our
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A short railway journey, and a shorter drive,
brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa,
standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland.
Three small projections above the upper windows
made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind
was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and
the whole aspect of the place was poor and de-
pressing. None the less, we found the house to be
well furnished, and the lady who received us was
a most engaging elderly person, who bore every
mark of refinement and culture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember your husband well, madam,&#8221; said
Holmes, &#8220;though it is some years since he used my
services in some trifling matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably you would be more familiar with the
name of my son Douglas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked at her with great interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas
Maberley? I knew him slightly. But of course all
London knew him. What a magnificent creature
he was! Where is he now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attache
at Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last
month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry. One could not connect death with
such a man. I have never known anyone so vitally
alive. He lived intensely&#8212;every fibre of him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin
of him. You remember him as he was&#8212;debonair
and splendid. You did not see the moody, morose,
</p>
<p>brooding creature into which he developed. His
heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to
see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A love affair&#8212;a woman?&#8221;
&#8220;Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor
</p>
<p>lad that I asked you to come, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Dr. Watson and I are at your service.&#8221;
&#8220;There have been some very strange happen-
</p>
<p>ings. I have been in this house more than a year
now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have
seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had
a call from a man who said that he was a house
agent. He said that this house would exactly suit a
client of his, and that if I would part with it money
would be no object. It seemed to me very strange
as there are several empty houses on the market
which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I
was interested in what he said. I therefore named
a price which was five hundred pounds more than
I gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added
that his client desired to buy the furniture as well
and would I put a price upon it. Some of this fur-
niture is from my old home, and it is, as you see,
very good, so that I named a good round sum. To
this also he at once agreed. I had always wanted
to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that
it really seemed that I should be my own mistress
for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement
all drawn out. Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my
lawyer, who lives in Harrow. He said to me, &#8216;This
is a very strange document. Are you aware that if
you sign it you could not legally take anything out
of the house&#8212;not even your own private posses-
sions?&#8217; When the man came again in the evening
I pointed this out, and I said that I meant only to
sell the furniture.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No, no, everything,&#8217; said he.
&#8220; &#8216;But my clothes? My jewels?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Well, well, some concession might be made
</p>
<p>for your personal effects. But nothing shall go out
of the house unchecked. My client is a very liberal
man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing
things. It is everything or nothing with him.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then it must be nothing,&#8217; said I. And there
the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to
me to be so unusual that I thought&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.
Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he
</p>
<p>strode across the room, flung open the door, and
dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had
seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly
</p>
<p>894</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>struggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn,
squawking, out of its coop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave me alone! What are you a-doin&#8217; of?&#8221;
she screeched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Susan, what is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, I was comin&#8217; in to ask if the vis-
itors was stayin&#8217; for lunch when this man jumped
out at me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been listening to her for the last five
minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most
interesting narrative. Just a little wheezy, Susan,
are you not? You breathe too heavily for that kind
of work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her
captor. &#8220;Who be you, anyhow, and what right have
you a-pullin&#8217; me about like this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was merely that I wished to ask a question
in your presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, men-
tion to anyone that you were going to write to me
and consult me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who posted your letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you
wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress
was asking advice from me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie. I sent no message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long,
you know. It&#8217;s a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom
did you tell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan!&#8221; cried her mistress, &#8220;I believe you are
a bad, treacherous woman. I remember now that I
saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my own business,&#8221; said the woman
sullenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stock-
dale to whom you spoke?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you know, what do you want to ask
for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Su-
san, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will
tell me who is at the back of Barney.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone that could lay down a thousand
pounds for every ten you have in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, a rich man? No; you smiled&#8212;a rich
woman. Now we have got so far, you may as well
give the name and earn the tenner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you in hell first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Susan! Language!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am clearing out of here. I&#8217;ve had enough
of you all. I&#8217;ll send for my box to-morrow.&#8221; She
flounced for the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff. . .
Now,&#8221; he continued, turning suddenly from lively
to severe when the door had closed behind the
flushed and angry woman, &#8220;this gang means busi-
ness. Look how close they play the game. Your
letter to me had the 10 P. M. postmark. And
yet Susan passes the word to Barney. Barney has
time to go to his employer and get instructions;
he or she&#8212;I incline to the latter from Susan&#8217;s grin
when she thought I had blundered&#8212;forms a plan.
Black Steve is called in, and I am warned off by
eleven o&#8217;clock next morning. That&#8217;s quick work,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do they want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the question. Who had the house
before you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A retired sea captain called Ferguson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything remarkable about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that ever I heard of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering whether he could have
buried something. Of course, when people bury
treasure nowadays they do it in the Post-Office
bank. But there are always some lunatics about.
It would be a dull world without them. At first I
thought of some buried valuable. But why, in that
case, should they want your furniture? You don&#8217;t
happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shake-
speare without knowing it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think I have anything rarer than a
Crown Derby tea-set.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would hardly justify all this mystery. Be-
sides, why should they not openly state what they
want? If they covet your tea-set, they can surely
offer a price for it without buying you out, lock,
stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is some-
thing which you do not know that you have, and
which you would not give up if you did know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is how I read it,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see whether by this purely mental anal-
ysis we can get it to a finer point. You have been
in this house a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the better. During this long period no
one wants anything from you. Now suddenly
within three or four days you have urgent de-
mands. What would you gather from that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>895</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Gables
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can only mean,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that the object,
whatever it may be, has only just come into the
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Settled once again,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Now, Mrs.
Maberley, has any object just arrived?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have bought nothing new this year.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think
</p>
<p>we had best let matters develop a little further un-
til we have clearer data. Is that lawyer of yours a
capable man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sutro is most capable.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan,
</p>
<p>who has just banged your front door, alone?&#8221;
&#8220;I have a young girl.&#8221;
&#8220;Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in
</p>
<p>the house. You might possibly want protection.&#8221;
&#8220;Against whom?&#8221;
&#8220;Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure.
</p>
<p>If I can&#8217;t find what they are after, I must approach
the matter from the other end and try to get at the
principal. Did this house-agent man give any ad-
dress?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply his card and occupation. Haines-
Johnson, Auctioneer and Valuer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we shall find him in the directory.
Honest business men don&#8217;t conceal their place of
business. Well, you will let me know any fresh
development. I have taken up your case, and you
may rely upon it that I shall see it through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we passed through the hall Holmes&#8217;s eyes,
which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks
and cases which were piled in a corner. The labels
shone out upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Milano.&#8217; &#8216;Lucerne.&#8217; These are from Italy.&#8221;
&#8220;They are poor Douglas&#8217;s things.&#8221;
&#8220;You have not unpacked them? How long have
</p>
<p>you had them?&#8221;
&#8220;They arrived last week.&#8221;
&#8220;But you said&#8212;why, surely this might be the
</p>
<p>missing link. How do we know that there is not
something of value there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes.
Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small an-
nuity. What could he have of value?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was lost in thought.
&#8220;Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,&#8221; he said at
</p>
<p>last. &#8220;Have these things taken upstairs to your
bedroom. Examine them as soon as possible and
see what they contain. I will come to-morrow and
hear your report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was quite evident that The Three Gables
was under very close surveillance, for as we came
round the high hedge at the end of the lane
there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the
shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a
grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely
place. Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookin&#8217; for your gun, Masser Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be funny for you, Steve, if I get after
you. I gave you fair warning this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over
what you said, and I don&#8217;t want no more talk
about that affair of Masser Perkins. S&#8217;pose I can
help you, Masser Holmes, I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this
job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told
you the truth before. I don&#8217;t know. My boss Bar-
ney gives me orders and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady
in that house, and everything under that roof, is
under my protection. Don&#8217;t forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Masser Holmes. I&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him thoroughly frightened for his
own skin, Watson,&#8221; Holmes remarked as we
walked on. &#8220;I think he would double-cross his em-
ployer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I had
some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and
that Steve was one of them. Now, Watson, this is
a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see
him now. When I get back I may be clearer in the
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but
I could well imagine how he spent it, for Lang-
dale Pike was his human book of reference upon
all matters of social scandal. This strange, lan-
guid creature spent his waking hours in the bow
window of a St. James&#8217;s Street club and was the
receiving-station as well as the transmitter for all
the gossip of the metropolis. He made, it was said,
a four-figure income by the paragraphs which
he contributed every week to the garbage papers
which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far
down in the turbid depths of London life, there
was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked
with automatic exactness by this human dial upon
the surface. Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to
knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn.
</p>
<p>When I met my friend in his room early next
morning, I was conscious from his bearing that all

<p>896</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>was well, but none the less a most unpleasant sur-
prise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the
following telegram:
</p>
<p>Please come out at once. Client&#8217;s house
burgled in the night. Police in posses-
sion.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Sutro.
</p>
<p>Holmes whistled. &#8220;The drama has come to a
crisis, and quicker than I had expected. There is
a great driving-power at the back of this business,
Watson, which does not surprise me after what I
have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I
made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend
the night on guard. This fellow has clearly proved
a broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it but an-
other journey to Harrow Weald.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We found The Three Gables a very different es-
tablishment to the orderly household of the previ-
ous day. A small group of idlers had assembled
at the garden gate, while a couple of constables
were examining the windows and the geranium
beds. Within we met a gray old gentleman, who
introduced himself as the lawyer, together with a
bustling, rubicund inspector, who greeted Holmes
as an old friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this
case, I&#8217;m afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary,
and well within the capacity of the poor old police.
No experts need apply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure the case is in very good hands,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Merely a common burglary, you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. We know pretty well who the men
are and where to find them. It is that gang of Bar-
ney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it&#8212;they&#8217;ve
been seen about here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent! What did they get?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t seem to have got much. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Maberley was chloroformed and the house was&#8212;
Ah! here is the lady herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and
ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little
maidservant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said
she, smiling ruefully. &#8220;Alas, I did not take it! I
did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so I was
unprotected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only heard of it this morning,&#8221; the lawyer
explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend
in the house. I neglected his advice, and I have
paid for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look wretchedly ill,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Per-
haps you are hardly equal to telling me what oc-
curred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all here,&#8221; said the inspector, tapping a
bulky notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, if the lady is not too exhausted&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt
</p>
<p>that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for
them. They must have known the house to an
inch. I was conscious for a moment of the chlo-
roform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but
I have no notion how long I may have been sense-
less. When I woke, one man was at the bedside
and another was rising with a bundle in his hand
from among my son&#8217;s baggage, which was par-
tially opened and littered over the floor. Before he
could get away I sprang up and seized him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You took a big risk,&#8221; said the inspector.
&#8220;I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the
</p>
<p>other may have struck me, for I can remember no
more. Mary the maid heard the noise and began
screaming out of the window. That brought the
police, but the rascals had got away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they take?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think there is anything of value
</p>
<p>missing. I am sure there was nothing in my son&#8217;s
trunks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the men leave no clue?&#8221;
&#8220;There was one sheet of paper which I may
</p>
<p>have torn from the man that I grasped. It was ly-
ing all crumpled on the floor. It is in my son&#8217;s
handwriting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means that it is not of much use,&#8221; said
the inspector. &#8220;Now if it had been in the bur-
glar&#8217;s&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;What rugged com-
mon sense! None the less, I should be curious to
see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap
from his pocketbook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never pass anything, however trifling,&#8221; said
he with some pomposity. &#8220;That is my advice to
you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-five years&#8217; experi-
ence I have learned my lesson. There is always
the chance of finger-marks or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.
&#8220;What do you make of it, Inspector?&#8221;
&#8220;Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so
</p>
<p>far as I can see.&#8221;
&#8220;It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer
</p>
<p>tale,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You have noticed the num-
ber on the top of the page. It is two hundred and
</p>
<p>897</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Gables
</p>
<p>forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred and
forty-four pages?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much
good may it do them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a queer thing to break into a house in
order to steal such papers as that. Does it suggest
anything to you, Inspector?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the ras-
cals just grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish
them joy of what they got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should they go to my son&#8217;s things?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Maberley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs,
so they tried their luck upstairs. That is how I read
it. What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must think it over, Inspector. Come to the
window, Watson.&#8221; Then, as we stood together, he
read over the fragment of paper. It began in the
middle of a sentence and ran like this:
</p>
<p>&#8220;. . . face bled considerably from the cuts
and blows, but it was nothing to the bleed-
ing of his heart as he saw that lovely face,
the face for which he had been prepared to
sacrifice his very life, looking out at his
agony and humiliation. She smiled&#8212;yes,
by Heaven! she smiled, like the heartless
fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It
was at that moment that love died and hate
was born. Man must live for something. If
it is not for your embrace, my lady, then
it shall surely be for your undoing and my
complete revenge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer grammar!&#8221; said Holmes with a smile as
he handed the paper back to the inspector. &#8220;Did
you notice how the &#8216;he&#8217; suddenly changed to &#8216;my&#8217;?
The writer was so carried away by his own story
that he imagined himself at the supreme moment
to be the hero.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed mighty poor stuff,&#8221; said the inspec-
tor as he replaced it in his book. &#8220;What! are you
off, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is anything more for me to
do now that the case is in such capable hands. By
the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you wished to
travel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Where would you like to go&#8212;Cairo, Madeira,
</p>
<p>the Riviera?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, if I had the money I would go round the
</p>
<p>world.&#8221;
&#8220;Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-
</p>
<p>morning. I may drop you a line in the evening.&#8221; As
</p>
<p>we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the
inspector&#8217;s smile and shake of the head. &#8220;These
clever fellows have always a touch of madness.&#8221;
That was what I read in the inspector&#8217;s smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little
journey,&#8221; said Holmes when we were back in the
roar of central London once more. &#8220;I think we had
best clear the matter up at once, and it would be
well that you should come with me, for it is safer
to have a witness when you are dealing with such
a lady as Isadora Klein.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had taken a cab and were speeding to some
address in Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been
sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all
clearly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say that I do. I only gather that
we are going to see the lady who is behind all this
mischief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein
convey nothing to you? She was, of course, the
celebrated beauty. There was never a woman to
touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of
the masterful Conquistadors, and her people have
been leaders in Pernambuco for generations. She
married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and
presently found herself the richest as well as the
most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an
interval of adventure when she pleased her own
tastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maber-
ley, one of the most striking men in London, was
one of them. It was by all accounts more than an
adventure with him. He was not a society butterfly
but a strong, proud man who gave and expected
all. But she is the &#8216;belle dame sans merci&#8217; of fiction.
When her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended,
and if the other party in the matter can&#8217;t take her
word for it she knows how to bring it home to
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that was his own story&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear
</p>
<p>that she is about to marry the young Duke of
Lomond, who might almost be her son. His
Grace&#8217;s ma might overlook the age, but a big scan-
dal would be a different matter, so it is impera-
tive&#8212; Ah! here we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was one of the finest corner-houses of the
West End. A machine-like footman took up our
cards and returned with word that the lady was
not at home. &#8220;Then we shall wait until she is,&#8221;
said Holmes cheerfully.
</p>
<p>The machine broke down.
&#8220;Not at home means not at home to you,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>the footman.
</p>
<p>898</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;That means that
we shall not have to wait. Kindly give this note to
your mistress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet
of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say, Holmes?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;I simply wrote: &#8216;Shall it be the police, then?&#8217; I
</p>
<p>think that should pass us in.&#8221;
It did&#8212;with amazing celerity. A minute later
</p>
<p>we were in
