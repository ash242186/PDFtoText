<p>herlock Holmes had been bending for
a long time over a low-power micro-
scope. Now he straightened himself up
and looked round at me in triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is glue, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Unquestionably
it is glue. Have a look at these scattered objects in
the field!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my
vision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat.
The irregular gray masses are dust. There are ep-
ithelial scales on the left. Those brown blobs in the
centre are undoubtedly glue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, laughing, &#8220;I am prepared to take
your word for it. Does anything depend upon it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very fine demonstration,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;In the St. Pancras case you may remember that a
cap was found beside the dead policeman. The ac-
cused man denies that it is his. But he is a picture-
frame maker who habitually handles glue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it one of your cases?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; my friend, Merivale, of the Yard, asked
me to look into the case. Since I ran down that
coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of
his cuff they have begun to realize the importance
of the microscope.&#8221; He looked impatiently at his
watch. &#8220;I had a new client calling, but he is over-
due. By the way, Watson, you know something of
racing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to. I pay for it with about half my
wound pension.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll make you my &#8216;Handy Guide to the
Turf.&#8217; What about Sir Robert Norberton? Does the
name recall anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should say so. He lives at Shoscombe
Old Place, and I know it well, for my summer
quarters were down there once. Norberton nearly
came within your province once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer,
the well-known Curzon Street money-lender, on
Newmarket Heath. He nearly killed the man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, he sounds interesting! Does he often in-
dulge in that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he has the name of being a dangerous
man. He is about the most daredevil rider in Eng-
land&#8212;second in the Grand National a few years
back. He is one of those men who have overshot
their true generation. He should have been a buck
in the days of the Regency&#8212;a boxer, an athlete, a
plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by
</p>
<p>all account, so far down Queer Street that he may
never find his way back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital, Watson! A thumb-nail sketch. I seem
to know the man. Now, can you give me some idea
of Shoscombe Old Place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park,
and that the famous Shoscombe stud and training
quarters are to be found there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the head trainer,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;is John
Mason. You need not look surprised at my knowl-
edge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which
I am unfolding. But let us have some more about
Shoscombe. I seem to have struck a rich vein.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the Shoscombe spaniels,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You hear of them at every dog show. The most
exclusive breed in England. They are the special
pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert Norberton&#8217;s wife, I presume!&#8221;
&#8220;Sir Robert has never married. Just as well, I
</p>
<p>think, considering his prospects. He lives with his
widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that she lives with him?&#8221;
&#8220;No, no. The place belonged to her late hus-
</p>
<p>band, Sir James. Norberton has no claim on it at
all. It is only a life interest and reverts to her hus-
band&#8217;s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents ev-
ery year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the
said rents?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is about the size of it. He is a devil of a
fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. Yet I
have heard that she is devoted to him. But what is
amiss at Shoscombe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is just what I want to know. And
here, I expect, is the man who can tell us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door had opened and the page had shown
in a tall, clean-shaven man with the firm, austere
expression which is only seen upon those who
have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Ma-
son had many of both under his sway, and he
looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold self-
possession and seated himself upon the chair to
which Holmes had waved him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had my note, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, but it explained nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;It was too delicate a thing for me to put the de-
</p>
<p>tails on paper. And too complicated. It was only
face to face I could do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are at your disposal.&#8221;
&#8220;First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my em-
</p>
<p>ployer, Sir Robert, has gone mad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>969</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place
</p>
<p>Holmes raised his eyebrows. &#8220;This is Baker
Street, not Harley Street,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But why do
you say so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing,
or two queer things, there may be a meaning to
it, but when everything he does is queer, then you
begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and
the Derby have turned his brain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a colt you are running?&#8221;
&#8220;The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should
</p>
<p>know, if anyone does. Now, I&#8217;ll be plain with you,
for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that
it won&#8217;t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to
win this Derby. He&#8217;s up to the neck, and it&#8217;s his
last chance. Everything he could raise or borrow
is on the horse&#8212;and at fine odds, too! You can get
forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when
he began to back him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how is that if the horse is so good?&#8221;
&#8220;The public don&#8217;t know how good he is. Sir
</p>
<p>Robert has been too clever for the touts. He has
the Prince&#8217;s half-brother out for spins. You can&#8217;t
tell &#8217;em apart. But there are two lengths in a fur-
long between them when it comes to a gallop. He
thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. His
whole life is on it. He&#8217;s holding off the Jews till
then. If the Prince fails him he is done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where
does the madness come in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, first of all, you have only to look at him.
I don&#8217;t believe he sleeps at night. He is down at
the stables at all hours. His eyes are wild. It has
all been too much for his nerves. Then there is his
conduct to Lady Beatrice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! What is that?&#8221;
&#8220;They have always been the best of friends.
</p>
<p>They had the same tastes, the two of them, and
she loved the horses as much as he did. Every
day at the same hour she would drive down to see
them&#8212;and, above all, she loved the Prince. He
would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels
on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning
to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. But that&#8217;s
all over now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the
</p>
<p>horses. For a week now she has driven past the
stables with never so much as &#8216;Good-morning&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think there has been a quarrel?&#8221;
&#8220;And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that.
</p>
<p>Why else would he give away her pet spaniel that
she loved as if he were her child? He gave it a
</p>
<p>few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green
Dragon, three miles off, at Crendall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That certainly did seem strange.&#8221;
&#8220;Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy
</p>
<p>one couldn&#8217;t expect that she could get about with
him, but he spent two hours every evening in her
room. He might well do what he could, for she
has been a rare good friend to him. But that&#8217;s all
over, too. He never goes near her. And she takes it
to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking,
Mr. Holmes&#8212;drinking like a fish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she drink before this estrangement?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a
</p>
<p>whole bottle of an evening. So Stephens, the but-
ler, told me. It&#8217;s all changed, Mr. Holmes, and
there is something damned rotten about it. But
then, again, what is master doing down at the old
church crypt at night? And who is the man that
meets him there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands.
&#8220;Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more
</p>
<p>interesting.&#8221;
&#8220;It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve
</p>
<p>o&#8217;clock at night and raining hard. So next night
I was up at the house and, sure enough, master
was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but
it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad
job if he had seen us. He&#8217;s a terrible man with his
fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons.
So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked
him down all right. It was the haunted crypt that
he was making for, and there was a man waiting
for him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this haunted crypt?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the
</p>
<p>park. It is so old that nobody could fix its date.
And under it there&#8217;s a crypt which has a bad name
among us. It&#8217;s a dark, damp, lonely place by day,
but there are few in that county that would have
the nerve to go near it at night. But master&#8217;s not
afraid. He never feared anything in his life. But
what is he doing there in the night-time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You say there is an-
other man there. It must be one of your own sta-
blemen, or someone from the house! Surely you
have only to spot who it is and question him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no one I know.&#8221;
&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was
</p>
<p>on that second night. Sir Robert turned and passed
us&#8212;me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes like
two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that
night. But we could hear the other moving about
</p>
<p>970</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>behind. We were not afraid of him. So we up
when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were
just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we
came right on him as casual and innocent as you
please. &#8216;Hullo, mate! who may you be?&#8217; says I. I
guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked
over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the
devil coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and
away he went as hard as he could lick it in the
darkness. He could run!&#8212;I&#8217;ll give him that. In a
minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who
he was, or what he was, we never found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I would swear to his yellow face&#8212;a mean
</p>
<p>dog, I should say. What could he have in common
with Sir Robert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.
&#8220;Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?&#8221;
</p>
<p>he asked at last.
&#8220;There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been
</p>
<p>with her this five years.&#8221;
&#8220;And is, no doubt, devoted?&#8221;
Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.
&#8220;She&#8217;s devoted enough,&#8221; he answered at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t say to whom.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell tales out of school.&#8221;
&#8220;I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the
</p>
<p>situation is clear enough. From Dr. Watson&#8217;s de-
scription of Sir Robert I can realize that no woman
is safe from him. Don&#8217;t you think the quarrel be-
tween brother and sister may lie there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a
long time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she may not have seen it before. Let us
suppose that she has suddenly found it out. She
wants to get rid of the woman. Her brother will
not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart
and inability to get about, has no means of enforc-
ing her will. The hated maid is still tied to her.
The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink.
Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away
from her. Does not all this hang together?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it might do&#8212;so far as it goes.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that
</p>
<p>bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? We
can&#8217;t fit that into our plot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, and there is something more that I
can&#8217;t fit in. Why should Sir Robert want to dig up
a dead body?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat up abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We only found it out yesterday&#8212;after I had
written to you. Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to
London, so Stephens and I went down to the crypt.
It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was
a bit of a human body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You informed the police, I suppose?&#8221;
Our visitor smiled grimly.
&#8220;Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them.
</p>
<p>It was just the head and a few bones of a mummy.
It may have been a thousand years old. But it
wasn&#8217;t there before. That I&#8217;ll swear, and so will
Stephens. It had been stowed away in a corner and
covered over with a board, but that corner had al-
ways been empty before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do with it?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, we just left it there.&#8221;
&#8220;That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away
</p>
<p>yesterday. Has he returned?&#8221;
&#8220;We expect him back to-day.&#8221;
&#8220;When did Sir Robert give away his sister&#8217;s
</p>
<p>dog?&#8221;
&#8220;It was just a week ago to-day. The creature
</p>
<p>was howling outside the old well-house, and Sir
Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning.
He caught it up, and I thought he would have
killed it. Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey,
and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at the
Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He
had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not clear yet what you want me to do in
this matter, Mr. Mason,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
make it more definite?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said our visitor.
</p>
<p>He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrap-
ping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of
bone.
</p>
<p>Holmes examined it with interest.
&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221;
&#8220;There is a central heating furnace in the cellar
</p>
<p>under Lady Beatrice&#8217;s room. It&#8217;s been off for some
time, but Sir Robert complained of cold and had
it on again. Harvey runs it&#8212;he&#8217;s one of my lads.
This very morning he came to me with this which
he found raking out the cinders. He didn&#8217;t like the
look of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;What do you make
of it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was burned to a black cinder, but there could
be no question as to its anatomical significance.
</p>
<p>971</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the upper condyle of a human femur,&#8221;
said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; Holmes had become very serious.
&#8220;When does this lad tend to the furnace?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes it up every evening and then leaves
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then anyone could visit it during the night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you enter it from outside?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one door from outside. There is an-
other which leads up by a stair to the passage in
which Lady Beatrice&#8217;s room is situated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and
rather dirty. You say that Sir Robert was not at
home last night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not
he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the name of that inn you spoke of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Green Dragon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there good fishing in that part of Berk-
shire?&#8221; The honest trainer showed very clearly
upon his face that he was convinced that yet an-
other lunatic had come into his harassed life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I&#8217;ve heard there are trout in the mill-
stream and pike in the Hall lake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good enough. Watson and I are famous
fishermen&#8212;are we not, Watson? You may address
us in future at the Green Dragon. We should reach
it to-night. I need not say that we don&#8217;t want to
see you, Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and
no doubt I could find you if I want you. When we
have gone a little farther into the matter I will let
you have a considered opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus it was that on a bright May evening
Holmes and I found ourselves alone in a first-class
carriage and bound for the little &#8220;halt-on-demand&#8221;
station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was cov-
ered with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and
baskets. On reaching our destination a short drive
took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sport-
ing host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our
plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neigh-
bourhood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the Hall lake and the chance of a
pike?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>The face of the innkeeper clouded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t do, sir. You might chance to
find yourself in the lake before you were through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, then?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s Sir Robert, sir. He&#8217;s terrible jealous of
</p>
<p>touts. If you two strangers were as near his train-
ing quarters as that he&#8217;d be after you as sure as
fate. He ain&#8217;t taking no chances, Sir Robert ain&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard he has a horse entered for the
Derby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all
our money for the race, and all Sir Robert&#8217;s into
the bargain. By the way&#8221;&#8212;he looked at us with
thoughtful eyes&#8212;&#8220;I suppose you ain&#8217;t on the turf
yourselves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Just two weary Londoners who
badly need some good Berkshire air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are in the right place for that. There
is a deal of it lying about. But mind what I have
told you about Sir Robert. He&#8217;s the sort that strikes
first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the
park.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the
way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was
whining in the hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it was. That was the real
Shoscombe breed. There ain&#8217;t a better in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a dog-fancier myself,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize
dog like that cost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert
himself who gave me this one. That&#8217;s why I have
to keep it on a lead. It would be off to the Hall in
a jiffy if I gave it its head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are getting some cards in our hand, Wat-
son,&#8221; said Holmes when the landlord had left us.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not an easy one to play, but we may see our
way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is
still in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter
the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily
assault. There are one or two points on which I
should like reassurance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any theory, Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;Only this, Watson, that something happened
</p>
<p>a week or so ago which has cut deep into the
life of the Shoscombe household. What is that
something? We can only guess at it from its ef-
fects. They seem to be of a curiously mixed char-
acter. But that should surely help us. It is only the
colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us consider our data. The brother no
longer visits the beloved invalid sister. He gives
away her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does
that suggest nothing to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but the brother&#8217;s spite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>972</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, it might be so. Or&#8212;well, there is an al-
ternative. Now to continue our review of the sit-
uation from the time that the quarrel, if there is
a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, al-
ters her habits, is not seen save when she drives
out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to
greet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to
drink. That covers the case, does it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Save for the business in the crypt.&#8221;
&#8220;That is another line of thought. There are
</p>
<p>two, and I beg you will not tangle them. Line A,
which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinis-
ter flavour, has it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make nothing of it.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, now, let us take up line B, which con-
</p>
<p>cerns Sir Robert. He is mad keen upon winning
the Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may
at any moment be sold up and his racing stables
seized by his creditors. He is a daring and desper-
ate man. He derives his income from his sister. His
sister&#8217;s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to
be on fairly safe ground, do we not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the crypt?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson&#8212;it
</p>
<p>is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis
put forward for argument&#8217;s sake&#8212;that Sir Robert
has done away with his sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.&#8221;
&#8220;Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of
</p>
<p>an honourable stock. But you do occasionally find
a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for a mo-
ment argue upon this supposition. He could not
fly the country until he had realized his fortune,
and that fortune could only be realized by bringing
off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he
has still to stand his ground. To do this he would
have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he
would also have to find a substitute who would
impersonate her. With the maid as his confidante
that would not be impossible. The woman&#8217;s body
might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so
seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed
at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such ev-
idence as we have already seen. What say you to
that, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is all possible if you grant the original
monstrous supposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there is a small experiment which
we may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw
some light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we mean
to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have
our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold
some high converse upon eels and dace, which
</p>
<p>seems to be the straight road to his affections. We
may chance to come upon some useful local gossip
in the process.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the morning Holmes discovered that we had
come without our spoon-bait for jack, which ab-
solved us from fishing for the day. About eleven
o&#8217;clock we started for a walk, and he obtained
leave to take the black spaniel with us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; said he as we came to
two high park gates with heraldic griffins tower-
ing above them. &#8220;About midday, Mr. Barnes in-
forms me, the old lady takes a drive, and the car-
riage must slow down while the gates are opened.
When it comes through, and before it gathers
speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman
with some question. Never mind me. I shall stand
behind this holly-bush and see what I can see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of
an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche
coming down the long avenue, with two splendid,
high-stepping gray carriage horses in the shafts.
Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. I
stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the road-
way. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.
</p>
<p>The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was
able to get a good look at the occupants. A highly
coloured young woman with flaxen hair and im-
pudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an
elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of
shawls about her face and shoulders which pro-
claimed the invalid. When the horses reached the
highroad I held up my hand with an authoritative
gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired
if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.
</p>
<p>At the same moment Holmes stepped out and
released the spaniel. With a joyous cry it dashed
forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step.
Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to fu-
rious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive on! Drive on!&#8221; shrieked a harsh voice.
The coachman lashed the horses, and we were left
standing in the roadway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, that&#8217;s done it,&#8221; said Holmes as
he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited
spaniel. &#8220;He thought it was his mistress, and he
found it was a stranger. Dogs don&#8217;t make mis-
takes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was the voice of a man!&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Exactly! We have added one card to our hand,
</p>
<p>Watson, but it needs careful playing, all the same.&#8221;
My companion seemed to have no further
</p>
<p>plans for the day, and we did actually use our
fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place
</p>
<p>that we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was
only after that meal that Holmes showed signs of
renewed activity. Once more we found ourselves
upon the same road as in the morning, which led
us to the park gates. A tall, dark figure was await-
ing us there, who proved to be our London ac-
quaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, gentlemen,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I got
your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir Robert has not returned
yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is this crypt from the house?&#8221; asked
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good quarter of a mile.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I think we can disregard him alto-
</p>
<p>gether.&#8221;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The mo-
</p>
<p>ment he arrives he will want to see me to get the
last news of Shoscombe Prince.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see! In that case we must work without you,
Mr. Mason. You can show us the crypt and then
leave us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Ma-
son led us over the grass-lands until a dark mass
loomed up in front of us which proved to be the
ancient chapel. We entered the broken gap which
was once the porch, and our guide, stumbling
among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way
to the corner of the building, where a steep stair
led down into the crypt. Striking a match, he il-
luminated the melancholy place&#8212;dismal and evil-
smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-
hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and
some of stone, extending upon one side right up
to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in
the shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his
lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow
light upon the mournful scene. Its rays were re-
flected back from the coffin-plates, many of them
adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old
family which carried its honours even to the gate
of Death.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could
you show them before you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are here in this corner.&#8221; The trainer
strode across and then stood in silent surprise as
our light was turned upon the place. &#8220;They are
gone,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I expected,&#8221; said Holmes, chuckling. &#8220;I
fancy the ashes of them might even now be found
in that oven which had already consumed a part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why in the world would anyone want to
burn the bones of a man who has been dead a
thousand years?&#8221; asked John Mason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we are here to find out,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;It may mean a long search, and we need
not detain you. I fancy that we shall get our solu-
tion before morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to
work making a very careful examination of the
graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which ap-
peared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long
line of Norman Hugos and Odos, until we reached
the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the eigh-
teenth century. It was an hour or more before
Holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end
before the entrance to the vault. I heard his little
cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried
but purposeful movements that he had reached
a goal. With his lens he was eagerly examining
the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from
his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he
thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front,
which seemed to be secured by only a couple of
clamps. There was a rending, tearing sound as it
gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly
revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen
interruption.
</p>
<p>Someone was walking in the chapel above. It
was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a
definite purpose and knew well the ground upon
which he walked. A light streamed down the
stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it
was framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terri-
ble figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. A
large stable-lantern which he held in front of him
shone upward upon a strong, heavily moustached
face and angry eyes, which glared round him into
every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves
with a deadly stare upon my companion and my-
self.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the devil are you?&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;And
what are you doing upon my property?&#8221; Then, as
Holmes returned no answer, he took a couple of
steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he
carried. &#8220;Do you hear me?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Who are
you? What are you doing here?&#8221; His cudgel quiv-
ered in the air.
</p>
<p>But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to
meet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,&#8221;
he said in his sternest tone. &#8220;Who is this? And
what is it doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind
him. In the glare of the lantern I saw a body
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>swathed in a sheet from head to foot, with dread-
ful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, project-
