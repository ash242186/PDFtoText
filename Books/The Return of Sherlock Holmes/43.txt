Milverton</p>

<p>t is years since the incidents of which
I speak took place, and yet it is with
diffidence that I allude to them. For a
long time, even with the utmost discre-
</p>
<p>tion and reticence, it would have been impossible
to make the facts public; but now the principal per-
son concerned is beyond the reach of human law,
and with due suppression the story may be told in
such fashion as to injure no one. It records an abso-
lutely unique experience in the career both of Mr.
Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will
excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by
which he might trace the actual occurrence.
</p>
<p>We had been out for one of our evening ram-
bles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six
o&#8217;clock on a cold, frosty winter&#8217;s evening. As
Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a
card on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with
an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. I
picked it up and read:&#8212;
</p>
<p>Charles Augustus Milverton,
Appledore Towers,
</p>
<p>Hampstead.
Agent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst man in London,&#8221; Holmes an-
swered, as he sat down and stretched his legs be-
fore the fire. &#8220;Is anything on the back of the card?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I turned it over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will call at 6.30&#8212;C.A.M.,&#8221; I read.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! He&#8217;s about due. Do you feel a creep-
ing, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand
before the serpents in the Zoo and see the slith-
ery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly
eyes and wicked, flattened faces? Well, that&#8217;s how
Milverton impresses me. I&#8217;ve had to do with fifty
murderers in my career, but the worst of them
never gave me the repulsion which I have for this
fellow. And yet I can&#8217;t get out of doing business
with him&#8212;indeed, he is here at my invitation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the
blackmailers. Heaven help the man, and still more
the woman, whose secret and reputation come into
the power of Milverton. With a smiling face and a
heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until
he has drained them dry. The fellow is a genius in
his way, and would have made his mark in some
more savoury trade. His method is as follows: He
allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay
very high sums for letters which compromise peo-
ple of wealth or position. He receives these wares
</p>
<p>not only from treacherous valets or maids, but fre-
quently from genteel ruffians who have gained the
confidence and affection of trusting women. He
deals with no niggard hand. I happen to know
that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman
for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of
a noble family was the result. Everything which
is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are
hundreds in this great city who turn white at his
name. No one knows where his grip may fall, for
he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from
hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years
in order to play it at the moment when the stake
is best worth winning. I have said that he is the
worst man in London, and I would ask you how
could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood
bludgeons his mate with this man, who methodi-
cally and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings
the nerves in order to add to his already swollen
money-bags?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had seldom heard my friend speak with such
intensity of feeling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the fellow must be within
the grasp of the law?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, no doubt, but practically not.
What would it profit a woman, for example, to
get him a few months&#8217; imprisonment if her own
ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare
not hit back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent
person, then, indeed, we should have him; but he
is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no; we must
find other ways to fight him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why is he here?&#8221;
&#8220;Because an illustrious client has placed her
</p>
<p>piteous case in my hands. It is the Lady Eva Brack-
well, the most beautiful debutante of last season.
She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of
Dovercourt. This fiend has several imprudent let-
ters&#8212;imprudent, Watson, nothing worse&#8212;which
were written to an impecunious young squire in
the country. They would suffice to break off the
match. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl
unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have
been commissioned to meet him, and&#8212;to make
the best terms I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle
in the street below. Looking down I saw a stately
carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on
the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A foot-
man opened the door, and a small, stout man in a
shaggy astrachan overcoat descended. A minute
later he was in the room.
</p>
<p>Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty,
with a large, intellectual head, a round, plump,
</p>
<p>501</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton
</p>
<p>hairless face, a perpetual frozen smile, and two
keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from be-
hind broad, golden-rimmed glasses. There was
something of Mr. Pickwick&#8217;s benevolence in his
appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the
fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those rest-
less and penetrating eyes. His voice was as smooth
and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with
a plump little hand extended, murmuring his re-
gret for having missed us at his first visit. Holmes
disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at
him with a face of granite. Milverton&#8217;s smile
broadened; he shrugged his shoulders, removed
his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over
the back of a chair, and then took a seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman?&#8221; said he, with a wave in my
direction. &#8220;Is it discreet? Is it right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your
client&#8217;s interests that I protested. The matter is so
very delicate&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Watson has already heard of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can proceed to business. You say that
you are acting for Lady Eva. Has she empowered
you to accept my terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven thousand pounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the alternative?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it;
but if the money is not paid on the 14th there cer-
tainly will be no marriage on the 18th.&#8221; His insuf-
ferable smile was more complacent than ever.
</p>
<p>Holmes thought for a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You appear to me,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;to be tak-
ing matters too much for granted. I am, of course,
familiar with the contents of these letters. My
client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall
counsel her to tell her future husband the whole
story and to trust to his generosity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Milverton chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You evidently do not know the Earl,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>From the baffled look upon Holmes&#8217;s face I
could see clearly that he did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What harm is there in the letters?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are sprightly&#8212;very sprightly,&#8221; Milver-
ton answered. &#8220;The lady was a charming corre-
spondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of
Dovercourt would fail to appreciate them. How-
ever, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest
at that. It is purely a matter of business. If you
think that it is in the best interests of your client
</p>
<p>that these letters should be placed in the hands of
the Earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay
so large a sum of money to regain them.&#8221; He rose
and seized his astrachan coat.
</p>
<p>Holmes was grey with anger and mortification.
&#8220;Wait a little,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You go too fast. We
</p>
<p>would certainly make every effort to avoid scan-
dal in so delicate a matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Milverton relapsed into his chair.
&#8220;I was sure that you would see it in that light,&#8221;
</p>
<p>he purred.
&#8220;At the same time,&#8221; Holmes continued, &#8220;Lady
</p>
<p>Eva is not a wealthy woman. I assure you that
two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her
resources, and that the sum you name is utterly
beyond her power. I beg, therefore, that you will
moderate your demands, and that you will return
the letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure
you, the highest that you can get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Milverton&#8217;s smile broadened and his eyes twin-
kled humorously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware that what you say is true about the
lady&#8217;s resources,&#8221; said he. &#8220;At the same time, you
must admit that the occasion of a lady&#8217;s marriage
is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives
to make some little effort upon her behalf. They
may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present.
Let me assure them that this little bundle of letters
would give more joy than all the candelabra and
butter-dishes in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!&#8221; cried
</p>
<p>Milverton, taking out a bulky pocket-book. &#8220;I can-
not help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in not
making an effort. Look at this!&#8221; He held up a little
note with a coat-of-arms upon the envelope. &#8220;That
belongs to&#8212;well, perhaps it is hardly fair to tell
the name until to-morrow morning. But at that
time it will be in the hands of the lady&#8217;s husband.
And all because she will not find a beggarly sum
which she could get by turning her diamonds into
paste. It is such a pity. Now, you remember the
sudden end of the engagement between the Hon-
ourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only
two days before the wedding there was a para-
graph in the Morning Post to say that it was all off.
And why? It is almost incredible, but the absurd
sum of twelve hundred pounds would have set-
tled the whole question. Is it not pitiful? And here
I find you, a man of sense, boggling about terms
when your client&#8217;s future and honour are at stake.
You surprise me, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I say is true,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;The
money cannot be found. Surely it is better for you
</p>
<p>502</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>to take the substantial sum which I offer than to
ruin this woman&#8217;s career, which can profit you in
no way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An
exposure would profit me indirectly to a consider-
able extent. I have eight or ten similar cases ma-
turing. If it was circulated among them that I had
made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should
find all of them much more open to reason. You
see my point?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sprang from his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get behind him, Watson! Don&#8217;t let him out!
Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the
side of the room, and stood with his back against
the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he said, turning the
front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large
revolver, which projected from the inside pocket.
&#8220;I have been expecting you to do something orig-
inal. This has been done so often, and what good
has ever come from it? I assure you that I am
armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to
use my weapons, knowing that the law will sup-
port me. Besides, your supposition that I would
bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mis-
taken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now,
gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this
evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.&#8221; He
stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand
on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked
up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it
down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Mil-
verton was out of the room, and a few moments
after we heard the slam of the carriage door and
the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.
</p>
<p>Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands
buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk
upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing
embers. For half an hour he was silent and still.
Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his
decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his
bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman
with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe
at the lamp before descending into the street. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be back some time, Watson,&#8221; said he, and vanished
into the night. I understood that he had opened
his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton;
but I little dreamed the strange shape which that
campaign was destined to take.
</p>
<p>For some days Holmes came and went at all
hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his
time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not
</p>
<p>wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing.
At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening,
when the wind screamed and rattled against the
windows, he returned from his last expedition,
and having removed his disguise he sat before the
fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fash-
ion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not call me a marrying man, Wat-
son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be interested to hear that I am en-
</p>
<p>gaged.&#8221;
&#8220;My dear fellow! I congrat&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;To Milverton&#8217;s housemaid.&#8221;
&#8220;Good heavens, Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;I wanted information, Watson.&#8221;
&#8220;Surely you have gone too far?&#8221;
&#8220;It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber
</p>
<p>with a rising business, Escott by name. I have
walked out with her each evening, and I have
talked with her. Good heavens, those talks! How-
ever, I have got all I wanted. I know Milverton&#8217;s
house as I know the palm of my hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the girl, Holmes?&#8221;
He shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t help it, my dear Watson. You must
</p>
<p>play your cards as best you can when such a stake
is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that I
have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out
the instant that my back is turned. What a splen-
did night it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You like this weather?&#8221;
&#8220;It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle
</p>
<p>Milverton&#8217;s house to-night.&#8221;
I had a catching of the breath, and my skin
</p>
<p>went cold at the words, which were slowly uttered
in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a flash of
lightning in the night shows up in an instant ev-
ery detail of a wide landscape, so at one glance
I seemed to see every possible result of such an
action&#8212;the detection, the capture, the honoured
career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace,
my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious
Milverton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Holmes, think what you
are doing,&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, I have given it every consid-
eration. I am never precipitate in my actions, nor
would I adopt so energetic and indeed so danger-
ous a course if any other were possible. Let us
look at the matter clearly and fairly. I suppose that
you will admit that the action is morally justifiable,
though technically criminal. To burgle his house is
</p>
<p>503</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton
</p>
<p>no more than to forcibly take his pocket-book&#8212;an
action in which you were prepared to aid me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I turned it over in my mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said; &#8220;it is morally justifiable so long
as our object is to take no articles save those which
are used for an illegal purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable I have
only to consider the question of personal risk.
Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress
upon this when a lady is in most desperate need
of his help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be in such a false position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other
possible way of regaining these letters. The un-
fortunate lady has not the money, and there are
none of her people in whom she could confide.
To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we
can get the letters to-night this villain will be as
good as his word and will bring about her ruin.
I must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate
or I must play this last card. Between ourselves,
Watson, it&#8217;s a sporting duel between this fellow
Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best
of the first exchanges; but my self-respect and my
reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t like it; but I suppose it must be,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;When do we start?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are not going,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I give you
my word of honour&#8212;and I never broke it in my
life&#8212;that I will take a cab straight to the police-
station and give you away unless you let me share
this adventure with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that? You can&#8217;t tell what
may happen. Anyway, my resolution is taken.
Other people beside you have self-respect and
even reputations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow
cleared, and he clapped me on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We
have shared the same room for some years, and
it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the
same cell. You know, Watson, I don&#8217;t mind con-
fessing to you that I have always had an idea
that I would have made a highly efficient crimi-
nal. This is the chance of my lifetime in that di-
rection. See here!&#8221; He took a neat little leather
case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhib-
ited a number of shining instruments. &#8220;This is
</p>
<p>a first-class, up-to-date burgling kit, with nickel-
plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter, adapt-
able keys, and every modern improvement which
the march of civilization demands. Here, too, is
my dark lantern. Everything is in order. Have you
a pair of silent shoes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent. And a mask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make a couple out of black silk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that you have a strong natural turn
for this sort of thing. Very good; do you make the
masks. We shall have some cold supper before we
start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive
as far as Church Row. It is a quarter of an hour&#8217;s
walk from there to Appledore Towers. We shall
be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy
sleeper and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With
any luck we should be back here by two, with the
Lady Eva&#8217;s letters in my pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that
we might appear to be two theatre-goers home-
ward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a
hansom and drove to an address in Hampstead.
Here we paid off our cab, and with our great-coats
buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold and the wind
seemed to blow through us, we walked along the
edge of the Heath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a business that needs delicate treatment,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;These documents are contained in
a safe in the fellow&#8217;s study, and the study is the
ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand,
like all these stout, little men who do themselves
well, he is a plethoric sleeper. Agatha&#8212;that&#8217;s my
fiancee&#8212;says it is a joke in the servants&#8217; hall that
it&#8217;s impossible to wake the master. He has a sec-
retary who is devoted to his interests and never
budges from the study all day. That&#8217;s why we are
going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which
roams the garden. I met Agatha late the last two
evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give
me a clear run. This is the house, this big one
in its own grounds. Through the gate&#8212;now to
the right among the laurels. We might put on our
masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer
of light in any of the windows, and everything is
working splendidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With our black silk face-coverings, which
turned us into two of the most truculent figures in
London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house.
A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of
it, lined by several windows and two doors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his bedroom,&#8221; Holmes whispered.
&#8220;This door opens straight into the study. It would
</p>
<p>504</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and
we should make too much noise getting in. Come
round here. There&#8217;s a greenhouse which opens
into the drawing-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The place was locked, but Holmes removed a
circle of glass and turned the key from the inside.
An instant afterwards he had closed the door be-
hind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of
the law. The thick, warm air of the conservatory
and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants
took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the
darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs
which brushed against our faces. Holmes had re-
markable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in
the dark. Still holding my hand in one of his he
opened a door, and I was vaguely conscious that
we had entered a large room in which a cigar had
been smoked not long before. He felt his way
among the furniture, opened another door, and
closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt
several coats hanging from the wall, and I under-
stood that I was in a passage. We passed along it,
and Holmes very gently opened a door upon the
right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and
my heart sprang into my mouth, but I could have
laughed when I realized that it was the cat. A fire
was burning in this new room, and again the air
was heavy with tobacco smoke. Holmes entered
on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very
gently closed the door. We were in Milverton&#8217;s
study, and a portiere at the farther side showed the
entrance to his bedroom.
</p>
<p>It was a good fire, and the room was illumi-
nated by it. Near the door I saw the gleam of an
electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it
had been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fire-
place was a heavy curtain, which covered the bay
window we had seen from outside. On the other
side was the door which communicated with the
veranda. A desk stood in the centre, with a turn-
ing chair of shining red leather. Opposite was a
large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on
the top. In the corner between the bookcase and
the wall there stood a tall green safe, the firelight
flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon
its face. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then
he crept to the door of the bedroom, and stood
with slanting head listening intently. No sound
came from within. Meanwhile it had struck me
that it would be wise to secure our retreat through
the outer door, so I examined it. To my amazement
it was neither locked nor bolted! I touched Holmes
on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that
direction. I saw him start, and he was evidently as
surprised as I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he whispered, putting his lips
to my very ear. &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite make it out. Anyhow,
we have no time to lose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; stand by the door. If you hear anyone
</p>
<p>come, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away
as we came. If they come the other way, we can
get through the door if our job is done, or hide
behind these window curtains if it is not. Do you
understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I nodded and stood by the door. My first feel-
ing of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now
with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when
we were the defenders of the law instead of its
defiers. The high object of our mission, the con-
sciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the
villainous character of our opponent, all added to
the sporting interest of the adventure. Far from
feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dan-
gers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes
unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his
tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon
who performs a delicate operation. I knew that
the opening of safes was a particular hobby with
him, and I understood the joy which it gave him
to be confronted with this green and gold mon-
ster, the dragon which held in its maw the repu-
tations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs
of his dress-coat&#8212;he had placed his overcoat on a
chair&#8212;Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and
several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door
with my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready
for any emergency; though, indeed, my plans were
somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were
interrupted. For half an hour Holmes worked with
concentrated energy, laying down one tool, pick-
ing up another, handling each with the strength
and delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I
heard a click, the broad green door swung open,
and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper
packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes
picked one out, but it was hard to read by the flick-
ering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern,
for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the
next room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly
I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an in-
stant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked
up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and
darted behind the window curtain, motioning me
to do the same.
</p>
<p>It was only when I had joined him there that I
heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. There
was a noise somewhere within the house. A door
slammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull
murmur broke itself into the measured thud of
</p>
<p>505</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton
</p>
<p>heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in
the passage outside the room. They paused at the
door. The door opened. There was a sharp snick
as the electric light was turned on. The door closed
once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar
was borne to our nostrils. Then the footsteps con-
tinued backwards and forwards, backwards and
forwards, within a few yards of us. Finally, there
was a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased.
Then a key clicked in a lock and I heard the rustle
of papers.
</p>
<p>So far I had not dared to look out, but now I
gently parted the division of the curtains in front
of me and peeped through. From the pressure of
Holmes&#8217;s shoulder against mine I knew that he
was sharing my observations. Right in front of
us, and almost within our reach, was the broad,
rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we
had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he
had never been to his bedroom, but that he had
been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room
in the farther wing of the house, the windows of
which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head,
with its shining patch of baldness, was in the im-
mediate foreground of our vision. He was lean-
ing far back in the red leather chair, his legs out-
stretched, a long black cigar projecting at an angle
from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking
jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar.
In his hand he held a long legal document, which
he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing
rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so.
There was no promise of a speedy departure in his
composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.
</p>
<p>I felt Holmes&#8217;s hand steal into mine and give
me a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situa-
tion was within his powers and that he was easy
in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen
what was only too obvious from my position, that
the door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and
that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In
my own mind I had determined that if I were sure,
from the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his
eye, I would at once spring out, throw my great-
coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest
to Holmes. But Milverton never looked up. He
was languidly interested by the papers in his hand,
and page after page was turned as he followed
the argument of the lawyer. At least, I thought,
when he has finished the document and the cigar
he will go to his room; but before he had reached
the end of either there came a remarkable devel-
opment which turned our thoughts into quite an-
other channel.
</p>
<p>Several times I had observed that Milverton
looked at his watch, and once he had risen and
sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The
idea, however, that he might have an appointment
at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a
faint sound reached my ears from the veranda out-
side. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid
in his chair. The sound was repeated, and then
there came a gentle tap at the door. Milverton rose
and opened it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, curtly, &#8220;you are nearly half an
hour late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So this was the explanation of the unlocked
door and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton. There
was the gentle rustle of a woman&#8217;s dress. I had
closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton&#8217;s
face had turned in our direction, but now I ven-
tured very carefully to open it once more. He had
resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an in-
solent angle from the corner of his mouth. In front
of him, in the full glare of the electric light, there
stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face,
a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came
quick and fast, and every inch of the lithe figure
was quivering with strong emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Milverton, &#8220;you&#8217;ve made me lose
a good night&#8217;s rest, my dear. I hope you&#8217;ll prove
worth it. You couldn&#8217;t come any other time&#8212;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you couldn&#8217;t you couldn&#8217;t. If the
Countess is a hard mistress you have your chance
to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are
you shivering about? That&#8217;s right! Pull yourself
together! Now, let us get down to business.&#8221; He
took a note from the drawer of his desk. &#8220;You say
that you have five letters which compromise the
Countess d&#8217;Albert. You want to sell them. I want
to buy them. So far so good. It only remains to
fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of
course. If they are really good specimens&#8212;Great
heavens, is it you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman without a word had raised her veil
and dropped the mantle from her chin. It was a
dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted
Milverton, a face with a curved nose, strong,
dark eyebrows shading hard, glittering eyes, and
a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the woman whose life you
have ruined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his
voice. &#8220;You were so very obstinate,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why
did you drive me to such extremities? I assure you
</p>
<p>506</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I wouldn&#8217;t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every
man has his business, and what was I to do? I put
the price well within your means. You would not
pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you sent the letters to my husband, and
he&#8212;the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man
whose boots I was never worthy to lace&#8212;he broke
his gallant heart and died. You remember that last
night when I came through that door I begged and
prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face
as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward
heart cannot keep your lips from twitching? Yes,
you never thought to see me here again, but it was
that night which taught me how I could meet you
face to face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton,
what have you to say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t imagine that you can bully me,&#8221; said
he, rising to his feet. &#8220;I have only to raise my
voice, and I could call my servants and have you
arrested. But I will make allowance for your nat-
ural anger. Leave the room at once as you came,
and I will say no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman stood with her hand buried in her
bosom, and the same deadly smile on her thin lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will ruin no more lives as you ruined
mine. You will wring no more hearts as you wrung
mine. I will free the world of a poisonous thing.
Take that, you hound, and that!&#8212;and that!&#8212;and
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had drawn a little, gleaming revolver, and
emptied barrel after barrel into Milverton&#8217;s body,
the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front. He
shrank away and then fell forward upon the table,
coughing furiously and clawing among the papers.
Then he staggered to his feet, received another
shot, and rolled upon the floor. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done me,&#8221;
he cried, and lay still. The woman looked at him
intently and ground her heel into his upturned
face. She looked again, but there was no sound
or movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air
blew into the heated room, and the avenger was
gone.
</p>
<p>No interference upon our part could have
saved the man from his fate; but as the woman
poured bullet after bullet into Milverton&#8217;s shrink-
ing body I was about to spring out, when I felt
Holmes&#8217;s cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. I
understood the whole argument of that firm, re-
straining grip&#8212;that it was no affair of ours; that
justice had overtaken a villain; that we had our
own duties and our own objects which were not
to be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman
rushed from the room when Holmes, with swift,
silent steps, was over at the other door. He turned
</p>
<p>the key in the lock. At the same instant we heard
voices in the house and the sound of hurrying
feet. The revolver shots had roused the house-
hold. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across
to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of let-
ters, and poured them all into the fire. Again and
again he did it, until the safe was empty. Some-
one turned the handle and beat upon the outside
of the door. Holmes looked swiftly round. The
letter which had been the messenger of death for
Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the
table. Holmes tossed it in among the blazing pa-
pers. Then he drew the key from the outer door,
passed through after me, and locked it on the out-
side. &#8220;This way, Watson,&#8221; said he; &#8220;we can scale
the garden wall in this direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could not have believed that an alarm could
have spread so swiftly. Looking back, the huge
house was one blaze of light. The front door was
open, and figures were rushing down the drive.
The whole garden was alive with people, and
one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged
from the veranda and followed hard at our heels.
Holmes seemed to know the ground perfectly, and
he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation
of small trees, I close at his heels, and our fore-
most pursuer panting behind us. It was a six-foot
wall which barred our path, but he sprang to the
top and over. As I did the same I felt the hand of
the man behind me grab at my ankle; but I kicked
myself free and scrambled over a glass-strewn cop-
ing. I fell upon my face among some bushes; but
Holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and to-
gether we dashed away across the huge expanse
of Hampstead Heath. We had run two miles, I
suppose, before Holmes at last halted and listened
intently. All was absolute silence behind us. We
had shaken off our pursuers and were safe.
</p>
<p>We had breakfasted and were smoking our
morning pipe on the day after the remarkable
experience which I have recorded when Mr.
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, very solemn and im-
pressive, was ushered into our modest sitting-
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;good
morning. May I ask if you are very busy just
now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too busy to listen to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing
particular on hand, you might care to assist us in
a most remarkable case which occurred only last
night at Hampstead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;What was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>507</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;A murder&#8212;a most dramatic and remarkable
murder. I know how keen you are upon these
things, and I would take it as a great favour if you
would step down to Appledore Towers and give us
the benefit of your advice. It is no ordinary crime.
We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for
some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of
a villain. He is known to have held papers which
he used for blackmailing purposes. These papers
have all been burned by the murderers. No article
of value was taken, as it is probable that the crimi-
nals were men of good position, whose sole object
was to prevent social exposure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Criminals!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Plural!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, there were two of them. They were, as
</p>
<p>nearly as possible, captured red-handed. We have
their foot-marks, we have their description; it&#8217;s ten
to one that we trace them. The first fellow was a bit
too active, but the second was caught by the under-
gardener and only got away after a struggle. He
was a middle-sized, strongly-built man&#8212;square
jaw, thick neck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather vague,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes.
&#8220;Why, it might be a description of Watson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said the inspector, with much
amusement. &#8220;It might be a description of Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am afraid I can&#8217;t help you, Lestrade,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;The fact is that I knew this fellow
Milverton, that I considered him one of the most
dangerous men in London, and that I think there
</p>
<p>are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and
which therefore, to some extent, justify private re-
venge. No, it&#8217;s no use arguing. I have made up
my mind. My sympathies are with the criminals
rather than with the victim, and I will not handle
this case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had not said one word to me about the
tragedy which we had witnessed, but I observed
all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful
mood, and he gave me the impression, from his va-
cant eyes and his abstracted manner, of a man who
is striving to recall something to his memory. We
were in the middle of our lunch when he
