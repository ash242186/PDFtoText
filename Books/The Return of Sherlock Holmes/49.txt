<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>had intended &#8220;The Adventure of the
Abbey Grange&#8221; to be the last of those
exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, which I should ever communi-
</p>
<p>cate to the public. This resolution of mine was not
due to any lack of material, since I have notes of
many hundreds of cases to which I have never al-
luded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on
the part of my readers in the singular personality
and unique methods of this remarkable man. The
real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes
has shown to the continued publication of his ex-
periences. So long as he was in actual professional
practice the records of his successes were of some
practical value to him; but since he has definitely
retired from London and betaken himself to study
and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety
has become hateful to him, and he has perempto-
rily requested that his wishes in this matter should
be strictly observed. It was only upon my rep-
resenting to him that I had given a promise that
&#8220;The Adventure of the Second Stain&#8221; should be
published when the times were ripe, and pointing
out to him that it is only appropriate that this long
series of episodes should culminate in the most im-
portant international case which he has ever been
called upon to handle, that I at last succeeded in
obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded ac-
count of the incident should at last be laid before
the public. If in telling the story I seem to be some-
what vague in certain details the public will read-
ily understand that there is an excellent reason for
my reticence.
</p>
<p>It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade,
that shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday
morning in autumn we found two visitors of Euro-
pean fame within the walls of our humble room in
Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-
eyed, and dominant, was none other than the il-
lustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain.
The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet
of middle age, and endowed with every beauty
of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable
Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,
and the most rising statesman in the country. They
sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and
it was easy to see from their worn and anxious
faces that it was business of the most pressing im-
portance which had brought them. The Premier&#8217;s
thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over
the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, as-
cetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
European Secretary pulled nervously at his mous-
tache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-
chain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes,
which was at eight o&#8217;clock this morning, I at once
informed the Prime Minister. It was at his sugges-
tion that we have both come to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you informed the police?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the Prime Minister, with the
</p>
<p>quick, decisive manner for which he was famous.
&#8220;We have not done so, nor is it possible that we
should do so. To inform the police must, in the
long run, mean to inform the public. This is what
we particularly desire to avoid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why, sir?&#8221;
&#8220;Because the document in question is of such
</p>
<p>immense importance that its publication might
very easily&#8212;I might almost say probably&#8212;lead to
European complications of the utmost moment. It
is not too much to say that peace or war may hang
upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be attended
with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be
recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those
who have taken it is that its contents should be
generally known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I
should be much obliged if you would tell me ex-
actly the circumstances under which this docu-
ment disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be done in a very few words, Mr.
Holmes. The letter&#8212;for it was a letter from a for-
eign potentate&#8212;was received six days ago. It was
of such importance that I have never left it in my
safe, but I have taken it across each evening to my
house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept it in my bed-
room in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the
box while I was dressing for dinner, and saw the
document inside. This morning it was gone. The
despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my
dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so
is my wife. We are both prepared to swear that no
one could have entered the room during the night.
And yet I repeat that the paper is gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time did you dine?&#8221;
&#8220;Half-past seven.&#8221;
&#8220;How long was it before you went to bed?&#8221;
&#8220;My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up
</p>
<p>for her. It was half-past eleven before we went to
our room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain
unguarded?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is ever permitted to enter that room
save the housemaid in the morning, and my valet,
or my wife&#8217;s maid, during the rest of the day. They
are both trusty servants who have been with us for
</p>
<p>573</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Second Stain
</p>
<p>some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly
have known that there was anything more valu-
able than the ordinary departmental papers in my
despatch-box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did know of the existence of that letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely your wife knew?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I
missed the paper this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Premier nodded approvingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have long known, sir, how high is your sense
of public duty,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am convinced that in
the case of a secret of this importance it would rise
superior to the most intimate domestic ties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The European Secretary bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this
morning I have never breathed one word to my
wife upon this matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could she have guessed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have
guessed&#8212;nor could anyone have guessed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lost any documents before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is there in England who did know of the
existence of this letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Each member of the Cabinet was informed of
it yesterday; but the pledge of secrecy which at-
tends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the
solemn warning which was given by the Prime
Minister. Good heavens, to think that within a few
hours I should myself have lost it!&#8221; His handsome
face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his
hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught
a glimpse of the natural man, impulsive, ardent,
keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask
was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
&#8220;Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two,
or possibly three, departmental officials who know
of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes,
I assure you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But abroad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that no one abroad has seen it save
the man who wrote it. I am well convinced that
his Ministers&#8212;that the usual official channels have
not been employed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes considered for some little time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly
what this document is, and why its disappearance
should have such momentous consequences?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance
and the Premier&#8217;s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a
frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one
of pale blue colour. There is a seal of red wax
stamped with a crouching lion. It is addressed in
large, bold handwriting to&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear, sir,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that, interesting and
indeed essential as these details are, my inquiries
must go more to the root of things. What was the
letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a State secret of the utmost importance,
and I fear that I cannot tell you, nor do I see that
it is necessary. If by the aid of the powers which
you are said to possess you can find such an enve-
lope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have
deserved well of your country, and earned any re-
ward which it lies in our power to bestow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are two of the most busy men in the coun-
try,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and in my own small way I have
also a good many calls upon me. I regret exceed-
ingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
continuation of this interview would be a waste of
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick,
fierce gleam of his deep-set eyes before which a
Cabinet has cowered. &#8220;I am not accustomed, sir&#8212;&#8221;
he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence.
Then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No
doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us
to expect you to act unless we give you our entire
confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, sir,&#8221; said the younger states-
man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your
honour and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson. I
may appeal to your patriotism also, for I could not
imagine a greater misfortune for the country than
that this affair should come out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may safely trust us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter, then, is from a certain foreign po-
tentate who has been ruffled by some recent Colo-
nial developments of this country. It has been
written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility
entirely. Inquiries have shown that his Ministers
know nothing of the matter. At the same time it is
couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain
phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that
its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most
</p>
<p>574</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>dangerous state of feeling in this country. There
would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesi-
tate to say that within a week of the publication
of that letter this country would be involved in a
great war.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and
handed it to the Premier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter&#8212;this
letter which may well mean the expenditure of a
thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thou-
sand men&#8212;which has become lost in this unac-
countable fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you informed the sender?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been
despatched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he desires the publication of the let-
ter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that
he already understands that he has acted in an in-
discreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a
greater blow to him and to his country than to us
if this letter were to come out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter
should come out? Why should anyone desire to
steal it or to publish it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions
of high international politics. But if you consider
the European situation you will have no difficulty
in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is
an armed camp. There is a double league which
makes a fair balance of military power. Great
Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven
into war with one confederacy, it would assure the
supremacy of the other confederacy, whether they
joined in the war or not. Do you follow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very clearly. It is then the interest of the en-
emies of this potentate to secure and publish this
letter, so as to make a breach between his country
and ours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to whom would this document be sent if
it fell into the hands of an enemy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe.
It is probably speeding on its way thither at the
present instant as fast as steam can take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his
chest and groaned aloud. The Premier placed his
hand kindly upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one
can blame you. There is no precaution which you
have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full
</p>
<p>possession of the facts. What course do you rec-
ommend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head mournfully.
&#8220;You think, sir, that unless this document is re-
</p>
<p>covered there will be war?&#8221;
&#8220;I think it is very probable.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, sir, prepare for war.&#8221;
&#8220;That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that
</p>
<p>it was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since I un-
derstand that Mr. Hope and his wife were both in
the room from that hour until the loss was found
out. It was taken, then, yesterday evening between
seven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the
earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew
that it was there and would naturally secure it as
early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this
importance were taken at that hour, where can it
be now? No one has any reason to retain it. It
has been passed rapidly on to those who need it.
What chance have we now to overtake or even to
trace it? It is beyond our reach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prime Minister rose from the settee.
&#8220;What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.&#8221;
&#8220;Let us presume, for argument&#8217;s sake, that
</p>
<p>the document was taken by the maid or by the
valet&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are both old and tried servants.&#8221;
&#8220;I understand you to say that your room is on
</p>
<p>the second floor, that there is no entrance from
without, and that from within no one could go up
unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the
house who has taken it. To whom would the thief
take it? To one of several international spies and
secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar
to me. There are three who may be said to be the
heads of their profession. I will begin my research
by going round and finding if each of them is at
his post. If one is missing&#8212;especially if he has
disappeared since last night&#8212;we will have some
indication as to where the document has gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he be missing?&#8221; asked the Euro-
pean Secretary. &#8220;He would take the letter to an
Embassy in London, as likely as not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy not. These agents work independently,
and their relations with the Embassies are often
strained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.
&#8220;I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would
</p>
<p>take so valuable a prize to head-quarters with his
own hands. I think that your course of action is
an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot ne-
glect all our other duties on account of this one
</p>
<p>575</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Second Stain
</p>
<p>misfortune. Should there be any fresh develop-
ments during the day we shall communicate with
you, and you will no doubt let us know the results
of your own inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely
from the room.
</p>
<p>When our illustrious visitors had departed
Holmes lit his pipe in silence, and sat for some
time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened the
morning paper and was immersed in a sensational
crime which had occurred in London the night be-
fore, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang
to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the man-
telpiece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is no better way of ap-
proaching it. The situation is desperate, but not
hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure which
of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has
not yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a
question of money with these fellows, and I have
the British Treasury behind me. If it&#8217;s on the mar-
ket I&#8217;ll buy it&#8212;if it means another penny on the
income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might
hold it back to see what bids come from this side
before he tries his luck on the other. There are
only those three capable of playing so bold a game;
there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lu-
cas. I will see each of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I glanced at my morning paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not see him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was murdered in his house last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend has so often astonished me in the
course of our adventures that it was with a sense of
exultation that I realized how completely I had as-
tonished him. He stared in amazement, and then
snatched the paper from my hands. This was the
paragraph which I had been engaged in reading
when he rose from his chair:
</p>
<p>Murder in Westminster
A crime of mysterious character was com-
mitted last night at 16, Godolphin Street,
one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows
of eighteenth-century houses which lie be-
tween the river and the Abbey, almost in
the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses
of Parliament. This small but select man-
sion has been inhabited for some years by
</p>
<p>Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in soci-
ety circles both on account of his charm-
ing personality and because he has the well-
deserved reputation of being one of the best
amateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas
is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of
age, and his establishment consists of Mrs.
Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mit-
ton, his valet. The former retires early and
sleeps at the top of the house. The valet
was out for the evening, visiting a friend at
Hammersmith. From ten o&#8217;clock onwards
Mr. Lucas had the house to himself. What
occurred during that time has not yet tran-
spired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-
constable Barrett, passing along Godolphin
Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was
ajar. He knocked, but received no answer.
Perceiving a light in the front room he ad-
vanced into the passage and again knocked,
but without reply. He then pushed open
the door and entered. The room was in a
state of wild disorder, the furniture being
all swept to one side, and one chair lying
on its back in the centre. Beside this chair,
and still grasping one of its legs, lay the un-
fortunate tenant of the house. He had been
stabbed to the heart and must have died in-
stantly. The knife with which the crime had
been committed was a curved Indian dag-
ger, plucked down from a trophy of Orien-
tal arms which adorned one of the walls.
Robbery does not appear to have been the
motive of the crime, for there had been no
attempt to remove the valuable contents of
the room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well
known and popular that his violent and
mysterious fate will arouse painful inter-
est and intense sympathy in a wide-spread
circle of friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, what do you make of this?&#8221; asked
Holmes, after a long pause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an amazing coincidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A coincidence! Here is one of the three men
whom we had named as possible actors in this
drama, and he meets a violent death during the
very hours when we know that that drama was
being enacted. The odds are enormous against
its being coincidence. No figures could express
them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are
connected&#8212;must be connected. It is for us to find
the connection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But now the official police must know all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>576</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Not at all. They know all they see
at Godolphin Street. They know&#8212;and shall
know&#8212;nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we
know of both events, and can trace the relation
between them. There is one obvious point which
would, in any case, have turned my suspicions
against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is
only a few minutes&#8217; walk from Whitehall Terrace.
The other secret agents whom I have named live
in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore,
for Lucas than for the others to establish a connec-
tion or receive a message from the European Sec-
retary&#8217;s household&#8212;a small thing, and yet where
events are compressed into a few hours it may
prove essential. Halloa! what have we here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady&#8217;s card
upon her salver. Holmes glanced at it, raised his
eyebrows, and handed it over to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be
kind enough to step up,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>A moment later our modest apartment, already
so distinguished that morning, was further hon-
oured by the entrance of the most lovely woman
in London. I had often heard of the beauty of
the youngest daughter of the Duke of Belmin-
ster, but no description of it, and no contempla-
tion of colourless photographs, had prepared me
for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful
colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as we
saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty
which would be the first thing to impress the ob-
server. The cheek was lovely, but it was paled
with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it was the
brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight
and drawn in an effort after self-command. Ter-
ror&#8212;not beauty&#8212;was what sprang first to the eye
as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
the open door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, madam, he has been here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that
I came here.&#8221; Holmes bowed coldly, and motioned
the lady to a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your ladyship places me in a very delicate po-
sition. I beg that you will sit down and tell me
what you desire; but I fear that I cannot make any
unconditional promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She swept across the room and seated herself
with her back to the window. It was a queenly
presence&#8212;tall, graceful, and intensely womanly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes,&#8221; she said, and her white-gloved
hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke&#8212;&#8220;I will
</p>
<p>speak frankly to you in the hope that it may in-
duce you to speak frankly in return. There is com-
plete confidence between my husband and me on
all matters save one. That one is politics. On this
his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing. Now, I
am aware that there was a most deplorable occur-
rence in our house last night. I know that a paper
has disappeared. But because the matter is polit-
ical my husband refuses to take me into his com-
plete confidence. Now it is essential&#8212;essential, I
say&#8212;that I should thoroughly understand it. You
are the only other person, save only these politi-
cians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened
and what it will lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes.
Let no regard for your client&#8217;s interests keep you
silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
would only see it, would be best served by tak-
ing me into his complete confidence. What was
this paper which was stolen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, what you ask me is really impossi-
ble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She groaned and sank her face in her hands.
&#8220;You must see that this is so, madam. If your
</p>
<p>husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this
matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true
facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It
is him whom you must ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have asked him. I come to you as a last re-
source. But without your telling me anything def-
inite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if
you would enlighten me on one point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, madam?&#8221;
&#8220;Is my husband&#8217;s political career likely to suf-
</p>
<p>fer through this incident?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, madam, unless it is set right it may cer-
</p>
<p>tainly have a very unfortunate effect.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; She drew in her breath sharply as one
</p>
<p>whose doubts are resolved.
&#8220;One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an ex-
</p>
<p>pression which my husband dropped in the first
shock of this disaster I understood that terrible
public consequences might arise from the loss of
this document.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.&#8221;
&#8220;Of what nature are they?&#8221;
&#8220;Nay, madam, there again you ask me more
</p>
<p>than I can possibly answer.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I will take up no more of your time. I
</p>
<p>cannot blame you, Mr. Holmes, for having refused
to speak more freely, and you on your side will
not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I de-
sire, even against his will, to share my husband&#8217;s
</p>
<p>577</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Second Stain
</p>
<p>anxieties. Once more I beg that you will say noth-
ing of my visit.&#8221; She looked back at us from the
door, and I had a last impression of that beauti-
ful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn
mouth. Then she was gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson, the fair sex is your depart-
ment,&#8221; said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwin-
dling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam of
the front door. &#8220;What was the fair lady&#8217;s game?
What did she really want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely her own statement is clear and her anx-
iety very natural.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! Think of her appearance, Watson&#8212;her
manner, her suppressed excitement, her restless-
ness, her tenacity in asking questions. Remember
that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show
emotion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was certainly much moved.&#8221;
&#8220;Remember also the curious earnestness with
</p>
<p>which she assured us that it was best for her hus-
band that she should know all. What did she mean
by that? And you must have observed, Watson,
how she manoeuvred to have the light at her back.
She did not wish us to read her expression.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she chose the one chair in the room.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet the motives of women are so in-
</p>
<p>scrutable. You remember the woman at Margate
whom I suspected for the same reason. No pow-
der on her nose&#8212;that proved to be the correct
solution. How can you build on such a quick-
sand? Their most trivial action may mean vol-
umes, or their most extraordinary conduct may
depend upon a hairpin or a curling-tongs. Good
morning, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are off?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; I will wile away the morning at Godol-
</p>
<p>phin Street with our friends of the regular estab-
lishment. With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of
our problem, though I must admit that I have not
an inkling as to what form it may take. It is a cap-
ital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts. Do
you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive
any fresh visitors. I&#8217;ll join you at lunch if I am
able.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All that day and the next and the next Holmes
was in a mood which his friends would call taci-
turn, and others morose. He ran out and ran in,
smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin,
sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irreg-
ular hours, and hardly answered the casual ques-
tions which I put to him. It was evident to me
that things were not going well with him or his
quest. He would say nothing of the case, and it
</p>
<p>was from the papers that I learned the particulars
of the inquest, and the arrest with the subsequent
release of John Mitton, the valet of the deceased.
The coroner&#8217;s jury brought in the obvious &#8220;Wilful
Murder,&#8221; but the parties remained as unknown as
ever. No motive was suggested. The room was
full of articles of value, but none had been taken.
The dead man&#8217;s papers had not been tampered
with. They were carefully examined, and showed
that he was a keen student of international poli-
tics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist,
and an untiring letter-writer. He had been on inti-
mate terms with the leading politicians of several
countries. But nothing sensational was discovered
among the documents which filled his drawers. As
to his relations with women, they appeared to have
been promiscuous but superficial. He had many
acquaintances among them, but few friends, and
no one whom he loved. His habits were regular,
his conduct inoffensive. His death was an abso-
lute mystery, and likely to remain so.
</p>
<p>As to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it
was a counsel of despair as an alternative to ab-
solute inaction. But no case could be sustained
against him. He had visited friends in Hammer-
smith that night. The alibi was complete. It is true
that he started home at an hour which should have
brought him to Westminster before the time when
the crime was discovered, but his own explana-
tion that he had walked part of the way seemed
probable enough in view of the fineness of the
night. He had actually arrived at twelve o&#8217;clock,
and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unex-
pected tragedy. He had always been on good
terms with his master. Several of the dead man&#8217;s
possessions&#8212;notably a small case of razors&#8212;had
been found in the valet&#8217;s boxes, but he explained
that they had been presents from the deceased,
and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the
story. Mitton had been in Lucas&#8217;s employment for
three years. It was noticeable that Lucas did not
take Mitton on the Continent with him. Some-
times he visited Paris for three months on end, but
Mitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street
house. As to the housekeeper, she had heard noth-
ing on the night of the crime. If her master had a
visitor he had himself admitted him.
</p>
<p>So for three mornings the mystery remained,
so far as I could follow it in the papers. If Holmes
knew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he
told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into
his confidence in the case, I knew that he was in
close touch with every development. Upon the
fourth day there appeared a long telegram from
Paris which seemed to solve the whole question.
</p>
<p>578</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A discovery has just been made by the
Parisian police [said the Daily Telegraph]
which raises the veil which hung round the
tragic fate of Mr. Eduardo Lucas, who met
his death by violence last Monday night at
Godolphin Street, Westminster. Our read-
ers will remember that the deceased gentle-
man was found stabbed in his room, and
that some suspicion attached to his valet,
but that the case broke down on an alibi.
Yesterday a lady, who has been known as
Mme. Henri Fournaye, occupying a small
villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported
to the authorities by her servants as being
insane. An examination showed that she
had indeed developed mania of a dangerous
and permanent form. On inquiry the police
have discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye
only returned from a journey to London on
Tuesday last, and there is evidence to con-
nect her with the crime at Westminster. A
comparison of photographs has proved con-
clusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Ed-
uardo Lucas were really one and the same
person, and that the deceased had for some
reason lived a double life in London and
Paris. Mme. Fournaye, who is of Creole
origin, is of an extremely excitable nature,
and has suffered in the past from attacks of
jealousy which have amounted to frenzy. It
is conjectured that it was in one of these
that she committed the terrible crime which
has caused such a sensation in London. Her
movements upon the Monday night have
not yet been traced, but it is undoubted
that a woman answering to her description
attracted much attention at Charing Cross
Station on Tuesday morning by the wild-
ness of her appearance and the violence of
her gestures. It is probable, therefore, that
the crime was either committed when in-
sane, or that its immediate effect was to
drive the unhappy woman out of her mind.
At present she is unable to give any co-
herent account of the past, and the doctors
hold out no hopes of the re-establishment
of her reason. There is evidence that a
woman, who might have been Mme. Four-
naye, was seen for some hours on Mon-
day night watching the house in Godolphin
Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that, Holmes?&#8221; I had read
the account aloud to him, while he finished his
breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson,&#8221; said he, as he rose from the
</p>
<p>table and paced up and down the room, &#8220;you are
most long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing
in the last three days it is because there is nothing
to tell. Even now this report from Paris does not
help us much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it is final as regards the man&#8217;s death.&#8221;
&#8220;The man&#8217;s death is a mere incident&#8212;a triv-
</p>
<p>ial episode&#8212;in comparison with our real task,
which is to trace this document and save a Eu-
ropean catastrophe. Only one important thing
has happened in the last three days, and that is
that nothing has happened. I get reports almost
hourly from the Government, and it is certain
that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trou-
ble. Now, if this letter were loose&#8212;no, it can&#8217;t be
loose&#8212;but if it isn&#8217;t loose, where can it be? Who
has it? Why is it held back? That&#8217;s the question
that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, in-
deed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his
death on the night when the letter disappeared?
Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not
among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry
it off with her? If so, is it in her house in Paris?
How could I search for it without the French po-
lice having their suspicions aroused? It is a case,
my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous
to us as the criminals are. Every man&#8217;s hand is
against us, and yet the interests at stake are colos-
sal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion
it will certainly represent the crowning glory of
my career. Ah, here is my latest from the front!&#8221;
He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been
handed in. &#8220;Halloa! Lestrade seems to have ob-
served something of interest. Put on your hat, Wat-
son, and we will stroll down together to Westmin-
ster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was my first visit to the scene of the crime&#8212;a
high, dingy, narrow-chested house, prim, formal,
and solid, like the century which gave it birth.
Lestrade&#8217;s bulldog features gazed out at us from
the front window, and he greeted us warmly when
a big constable had opened the door and let us in.
The room into which we were shown was that in
which the crime had been committed, but no trace
of it now remained, save an ugly, irregular stain
upon the carpet. This carpet was a small square
drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by
a broad expanse of beautiful, old-fashioned wood-
flooring in square blocks highly polished. Over
the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons,
one of which had been used on that tragic night. In
the window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and
every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the
rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which
was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy.
</p>
<p>579</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Second Stain
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen the Paris news?&#8221; asked Lestrade.
</p>
<p>Holmes nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our French friends seem to have touched the
spot this time. No doubt it&#8217;s just as they say. She
knocked at the door&#8212;surprise visit, I guess, for he
kept his life in water-tight compartments. He let
her in&#8212;couldn&#8217;t keep her in the street. She told
him how she had traced him, reproached him, one
thing led to another, and then with that dagger so
handy the end soon came. It wasn&#8217;t all done in
an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept
over yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he
had tried to hold her off with it. We&#8217;ve got it all
clear as if we had seen it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes raised his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you have sent for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, that&#8217;s another matter&#8212;a mere trifle,
but the sort of thing you take an interest in&#8212;queer,
you know, and what you might call freakish. It has
nothing to do with the main fact&#8212;can&#8217;t have, on
the face of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we
are very careful to keep things in their position.
Nothing has been moved. Officer in charge here
day and night. This morning, as the man was
buried and the investigation over&#8212;so far as this
room is concerned&#8212;we thought we could tidy up
a bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down;
only just laid there. We had occasion to raise it.
We found&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? You found&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s face grew tense with anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure you would never guess in a
hundred years what we did find. You see that stain
on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have soaked
through, must it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly it must.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you will be surprised to hear that there
is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No stain! But there must&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; so you would say. But the fact remains
that there isn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took the corner of the carpet in his hand
and, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed
as he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the underside is as stained as the upper.
It must have left a mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puz-
zled the famous expert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll show you the explanation. There is a
second stain, but it does not correspond with the
other. See for yourself.&#8221; As he spoke he turned
over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure
enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square
white facing of the old-fashioned floor. &#8220;What do
you make of that, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is simple enough. The two stains
did correspond, but the carpet has been turned
round. As it was square and unfastened it was
easily done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The official police don&#8217;t need you, Mr.
Holmes, to tell them that the carpet must have
been turned round. That&#8217;s clear enough, for the
stains lie above each other&#8212;if you lay it over this
way. But what I want to know is, who shifted the
carpet, and why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see from Holmes&#8217;s rigid face that he
was vibrating with inward excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Lestrade,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has that con-
stable in the passage been in charge of the place all
the time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully.
Don&#8217;t do it before us. We&#8217;ll wait here. You take
him into the back room. You&#8217;ll be more likely to
get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how
he dared to admit people and leave them alone in
this room. Don&#8217;t ask him if he has done it. Take it
for granted. Tell him you know someone has been
here. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is
his only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I
tell you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, if he knows I&#8217;ll have it out of him!&#8221;
cried Lestrade. He darted into the hall, and a few
moments later his bullying voice sounded from the
back room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson, now!&#8221; cried Holmes, with fren-
zied eagerness. All the demoniacal force of the
man masked behind that listless manner burst out
in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from
the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands
and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood
beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his
nails into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid
of a box. A small black cavity opened beneath it.
Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew
it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappoint-
ment. It was empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!&#8221;
The wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget
had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade&#8217;s
voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes
</p>
<p>580</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, re-
signed and patient, endeavouring to conceal his
irrepressible yawns.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can
see that you are bored to death with the whole af-
fair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come in
here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of
your most inexcusable conduct.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled
into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant no harm, sir, I&#8217;m sure. The young
woman came to the door last evening&#8212;mistook
the house, she did. And then we got talking. It&#8217;s
lonesome, when you&#8217;re on duty here all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what happened then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She wanted to see where the crime was
done&#8212;had read about it in the papers, she said.
She was a very respectable, well-spoken young
woman, sir, and I saw no harm in letting her have
a peep. When she saw that mark on the carpet,
down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she
were dead. I ran to the back and got some water,
but I could not bring her to. Then I went round the
corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy, and by the
time I had brought it back the young woman had
recovered and was off&#8212;ashamed of herself, I dare
say, and dared not face me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about moving that drugget?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when
I came back. You see, she fell on it, and it lies on
a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place. I
straightened it out afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lesson to you that you can&#8217;t deceive me,
Constable MacPherson,&#8221; said Lestrade, with dig-
nity. &#8220;No doubt you thought that your breach of
duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere
glance at that drugget was enough to convince me
that someone had been admitted to the room. It&#8217;s
lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing,
or you would find yourself in Queer Street. I&#8217;m
sorry to have called you down over such a petty
business, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of
the second stain not corresponding with the first
would interest you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, it was most interesting. Has this
woman only been here once, constable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, only once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know the name, sir. Was answering
an advertisement about type-writing, and came to
the wrong number&#8212;very pleasant, genteel young
woman, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tall? Handsome?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; she was a well-grown young woman.
</p>
<p>I suppose you might say she was handsome. Per-
haps some would say she was very handsome.
&#8216;Oh, officer, do let me have a peep!&#8217; says she. She
had pretty, coaxing ways, as you might say, and I
thought there was no harm in letting her just put
her head through the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was she dressed?&#8221;
&#8220;Quiet, sir&#8212;a long mantle down to her feet.&#8221;
&#8220;What time was it?&#8221;
&#8220;It was just growing dusk at the time. They
</p>
<p>were lighting the lamps as I came back with the
brandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Come, Watson,
I think that we have more important work else-
where.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we left the house Lestrade remained in the
front room, while the repentant constable opened
the door to let us out. Holmes turned on the step
and held up something in his hand. The constable
stared intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, sir!&#8221; he cried, with amazement on
his face. Holmes put his finger on his lips, re-
placed his hand in his breast-pocket, and burst out
laughing as we turned down the street. &#8220;Excel-
lent!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Come, friend Watson, the curtain
rings up for the last act. You will be relieved to
hear that there will be no war, that the Right Hon-
ourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in
his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign
will receive no punishment for his indiscretion,
that the Prime Minister will have no European
complication to deal with, and that with a little
tact and management upon our part nobody will
be a penny the worse for what might have been a
very ugly incident.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My mind filled with admiration for this ex-
traordinary man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have solved it!&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Hardly that, Watson. There are some points
</p>
<p>which are as dark as ever. But we have so much
that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the
rest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and
bring the matter to a head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we arrived at the residence of the Euro-
pean Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney
Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were
shown into the morning-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes!&#8221; said the lady, and her face was
pink with her indignation, &#8220;this is surely most un-
fair and ungenerous upon your part. I desired, as
I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret,
</p>
<p>581</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Second Stain
</p>
<p>lest my husband should think that I was intruding
into his affairs. And yet you compromise me by
coming here and so showing that there are busi-
ness relations between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible al-
ternative. I have been commissioned to recover
this immensely important paper. I must therefore
ask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in
my hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady sprang to her feet, with the colour
all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face.
Her eyes glazed&#8212;she tottered&#8212;I thought that she
would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied
from the shock, and a supreme astonishment and
indignation chased every other expression from
her features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8212;you insult me, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up
the letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She darted to the bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The butler shall show you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If you do, then all
my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frus-
trated. Give up the letter and all will be set right.
If you will work with me I can arrange everything.
If you work against me I must expose you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her
eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very
soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had for-
borne to ring it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very
manly thing, Mr. Holmes, to come here and brow-
beat a woman. You say that you know something.
What is it that you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down, madam. You will hurt your-
self there if you fall. I will not speak until you sit
down. Thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you five minutes, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your
visit to Eduardo Lucas, of your giving him this
document, of your ingenious return to the room
last night, and of the manner in which you took
the letter from the hiding-place under the carpet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stared at him with an ashen face and
gulped twice before she could speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mad, Mr. Holmes&#8212;you are mad!&#8221; she
cried, at last.
</p>
<p>He drew a small piece of cardboard from his
pocket. It was the face of a woman cut out of a
portrait.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have carried this because I thought it might
be useful,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The policeman has recog-
nised it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave a gasp and her head dropped back in
the chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Lady Hilda. You have the letter. The
matter may still be adjusted. I have no desire to
bring trouble to you. My duty ends when I have
returned the lost letter to your husband. Take
my advice and be frank with me; it is your only
chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her courage was admirable. Even now she
would not own defeat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you again, Mr. Holmes, that you are un-
der some absurd illusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rose from his chair.
&#8220;I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. I have done
</p>
<p>my best for you; I can see that it is all in vain.&#8221;
He rang the bell. The butler entered.
&#8220;Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?&#8221;
&#8220;He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.&#8221;
Holmes glanced at his watch.
&#8220;Still a quarter of an hour,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Very
</p>
<p>good, I shall wait.&#8221;
The butler had hardly closed the door behind
</p>
<p>him when Lady Hilda was down on her knees at
Holmes&#8217;s feet, her hands out-stretched, her beau-
tiful face upturned and wet with her tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes! Spare me!&#8221; she
pleaded, in a frenzy of supplication. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s
sake, don&#8217;t tell him! I love him so! I would not
bring one shadow on his life, and this I know
would break his noble heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes raised the lady. &#8220;I am thankful,
madam, that you have come to your senses even
at this last moment! There is not an instant to lose.
Where is the letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked
it, and drew out a long blue envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is, Mr. Holmes. Would to Heaven I
had never seen it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we return it?&#8221; Holmes muttered.
&#8220;Quick, quick, we must think of some way! Where
is the despatch-box?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still in his bedroom.&#8221;
&#8220;What a stroke of luck! Quick, madam, bring
</p>
<p>it here!&#8221;
A moment later she had appeared with a red
</p>
<p>flat box in her hand.
&#8220;How did you open it before? You have a du-
</p>
<p>plicate key? Yes, of course you have. Open it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>582</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>From out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn
a small key. The box flew open. It was stuffed with
papers. Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep
down into the heart of them, between the leaves of
some other document. The box was shut, locked,
and returned to the bedroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are ready for him,&#8221; said Holmes; &#8220;we
have still ten minutes. I am going far to screen you,
Lady Hilda. In return you will spend the time in
telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraor-
dinary affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,&#8221; cried
the lady. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would cut off my
right hand before I gave him a moment of sor-
row! There is no woman in all London who loves
her husband as I do, and yet if he knew how I
have acted&#8212;how I have been compelled to act&#8212;he
would never forgive me. For his own honour
stands so high that he could not forget or pardon
a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes! My hap-
piness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, madam, the time grows short!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indis-
creet letter written before my marriage&#8212;a foolish
letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. I meant
no harm, and yet he would have thought it crimi-
nal. Had he read that letter his confidence would
have been for ever destroyed. It is years since I
wrote it. I had thought that the whole matter was
forgotten. Then at last I heard from this man, Lu-
cas, that it had passed into his hands, and that he
would lay it before my husband. I implored his
mercy. He said that he would return my letter if
I would bring him a certain document which he
described in my husband&#8217;s despatch-box. He had
some spy in the office who had told him of its ex-
istence. He assured me that no harm could come
to my husband. Put yourself in my position, Mr.
Holmes! What was I to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your husband into your confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not! On the
one side seemed certain ruin; on the other, terrible
as it seemed to take my husband&#8217;s paper, still in a
matter of politics I could not understand the con-
sequences, while in a matter of love and trust they
were only too clear to me. I did it, Mr. Holmes!
I took an impression of his key; this man Lu-
cas furnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-
box, took the paper, and conveyed it to Godolphin
Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened there, madam?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tapped at the door as agreed. Lucas opened
it. I followed him into his room, leaving the hall
</p>
<p>door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone with
the man. I remember that there was a woman out-
side as I entered. Our business was soon done. He
had my letter on his desk; I handed him the docu-
ment. He gave me the letter. At this instant there
was a sound at the door. There were steps in the
passage. Lucas quickly turned back the drugget,
thrust the document into some hiding-place there,
and covered it over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened after that is like some fearful
dream. I have a vision of a dark, frantic face, of
a woman&#8217;s voice, which screamed in French, &#8216;My
waiting is not in vain. At last, at last I have found
you with her!&#8217; There was a savage struggle. I saw
him with a chair in his hand, a knife gleamed in
hers. I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from
the house, and only next morning in the paper did
I learn the dreadful result. That night I was happy,
for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the
future would bring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the next morning that I realized that I
had only exchanged one trouble for another. My
husband&#8217;s anguish at the loss of his paper went to
my heart. I could hardly prevent myself from there
and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him
what I had done. But that again would mean a
confession of the past. I came to you that morning
in order to understand the full enormity of my of-
fence. From the instant that I grasped it my whole
mind was turned to the one thought of getting
back my husband&#8217;s paper. It must still be where
Lucas had placed it, for it was concealed before
this dreadful woman entered the room. If it had
not been for her coming, I should not have known
where his hiding-place was. How was I to get into
the room? For two days I watched the place, but
the door was never left open. Last night I made a
last attempt. What I did and how I succeeded, you
have already learned. I brought the paper back
with me, and thought of destroying it since I could
see no way of returning it, without confessing my
guilt to my husband. Heavens, I hear his step upon
the stair!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The European Secretary burst excitedly into the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news, Mr. Holmes, any news?&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some hopes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, thank heaven!&#8221; His face became radiant.
&#8220;The Prime Minister is lunching with me. May he
share your hopes? He has nerves of steel, and yet
I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible
event. Jacobs, will you ask the Prime Minister to
</p>
<p>583</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>come up? As to you, dear, I fear that this is a mat-
ter of politics. We will join you in a few minutes in
the dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&#8217;s manner was subdued,
but I could see by the gleam of his eyes and the
twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the
excitement of his young colleague.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you have something to re-
port, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Purely negative as yet,&#8221; my friend answered.
&#8220;I have inquired at every point where it might be,
and I am sure that there is no danger to be appre-
hended.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is not enough, Mr. Holmes. We can-
not live for ever on such a volcano. We must have
something definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in hopes of getting it. That is why I am
here. The more I think of the matter the more
convinced I am that the letter has never left this
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;If it had it would certainly have been public
</p>
<p>by now.&#8221;
&#8220;But why should anyone take it in order to
</p>
<p>keep it in his house?&#8221;
&#8220;I am not convinced that anyone did take it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then how could it leave the despatch-box?&#8221;
&#8220;I am not convinced that it ever did leave the
</p>
<p>despatch-box.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. You
</p>
<p>have my assurance that it left the box.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you examined the box since Tuesday
</p>
<p>morning?&#8221;
&#8220;No; it was not necessary.&#8221;
&#8220;You may conceivably have overlooked it.&#8221;
&#8220;Impossible, I say.&#8221;
&#8220;But I am not convinced of it; I have known
</p>
<p>such things to happen. I presume there are other
papers there. Well, it may have got mixed with
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on the top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone may have shaken the box and dis-
placed it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; I had everything out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it is easily decided, Hope,&#8221; said the
Premier. &#8220;Let us have the despatch-box brought
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Secretary rang the bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. This is
a farcical waste of time, but still, if nothing else
will satisfy you, it shall be done. Thank you, Ja-
cobs; put it here. I have always had the key on my
watch-chain. Here are the papers, you see. Letter
from Lord Merrow, report from Sir Charles Hardy,
memorandum from Belgrade, note on the Russo-
German grain taxes, letter from Madrid, note from
Lord Flowers&#8212;good heavens! what is this? Lord
Bellinger! Lord Bellinger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Premier snatched the blue envelope from
his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is it&#8212;and the letter is intact. Hope, I
congratulate you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! Thank you! What a weight from
my heart. But this is inconceivable&#8212;impossible.
Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! How
did you know it was there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I knew it was nowhere else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot believe my eyes!&#8221; He ran wildly to
the door. &#8220;Where is my wife? I must tell her that
all is well. Hilda! Hilda!&#8221; we heard his voice on
the stairs.
</p>
<p>The Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There is more in this
than meets the eye. How came the letter back in
the box?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes turned away smiling from the keen
scrutiny of those wonderful eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have our diplomatic secrets,&#8221; said he,
and picking up his hat he turned to the door.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>r. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually
very late in the mornings, save upon
those not infrequent occasions when he
was up all night, was seated at the
</p>
<p>breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and
picked up the stick which our visitor had left be-
hind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which
is known as a &#8220;Penang lawyer.&#8221; Just under the
head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across.
&#8220;To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of
the C.C.H.,&#8221; was engraved upon it, with the date
&#8220;1884.&#8221; It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned
family practitioner used to carry&#8212;dignified, solid,
and reassuring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, what do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I
had given him no sign of my occupation.
</p>
<p>
