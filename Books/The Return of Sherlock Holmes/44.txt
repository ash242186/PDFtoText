<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>t was no very unusual thing for Mr.
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, to look in
upon us of an evening, and his visits
were welcome to Sherlock Holmes, for
</p>
<p>they enabled him to keep in touch with all that
was going on at the police head-quarters. In return
for the news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes
was always ready to listen with attention to the
details of any case upon which the detective was
engaged, and was able occasionally, without any
active interference, to give some hint or sugges-
tion drawn from his own vast knowledge and ex-
perience.
</p>
<p>On this particular evening Lestrade had spo-
ken of the weather and the newspapers. Then he
had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his cigar.
Holmes looked keenly at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything remarkable on hand?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. Holmes, nothing very particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that
there is something on my mind. And yet it is such
an absurd business that I hesitated to bother you
about it. On the other hand, although it is trivial,
it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have
a taste for all that is out of the common. But in my
opinion it comes more in Dr. Watson&#8217;s line than
ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Disease?&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness too!
You wouldn&#8217;t think there was anyone living at this
time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon
the First that he would break any image of him
that he could see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sank back in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no business of mine,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. That&#8217;s what I said. But then, when
the man commits burglary in order to break im-
ages which are not his own, that brings it away
from the doctor and on to the policeman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat up again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me
hear the details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade took out his official note-book and re-
freshed his memory from its pages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first case reported was four days ago,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;It was at the shop of Morse Hudson,
who has a place for the sale of pictures and stat-
ues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had
left the front shop for an instant when he heard a
</p>
<p>crash, and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of
Napoleon, which stood with several other works
of art upon the counter, lying shivered into frag-
ments. He rushed out into the road, but, although
several passers-by declared that they had noticed
a man run out of the shop, he could neither see
anyone nor could he find any means of identify-
ing the rascal. It seemed to be one of those sense-
less acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to
time, and it was reported to the constable on the
beat as such. The plaster cast was not worth more
than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared
to be too childish for any particular investigation.
</p>
<p>&#8221;The second case, however, was more serious
and also more singular. It occurred only last night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Kennington Road, and within a few hun-
dred yards of Morse Hudson&#8217;s shop, there lives a
well-known medical practitioner, named Dr. Bar-
nicot, who has one of the largest practices upon
the south side of the Thames. His residence and
principal consulting-room is at Kennington Road,
but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at
Lower Brixton Road, two miles away. This Dr. Bar-
nicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and
his house is full of books, pictures, and relics of
the French Emperor. Some little time ago he pur-
chased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plas-
ter casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the
French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in
his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the
other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower
Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down this
morning he was astonished to find that his house
had been burgled during the night, but that noth-
ing had been taken save the plaster head from the
hall. It had been carried out and had been dashed
savagely against the garden wall, under which its
splintered fragments were discovered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly very novel,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would please you. But I have not
got to the end yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his
surgery at twelve o&#8217;clock, and you can imagine
his amazement when, on arriving there, he found
that the window had been opened in the night,
and that the broken pieces of his second bust were
strewn all over the room. It had been smashed
to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there
any signs which could give us a clue as to the crim-
inal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now,
Mr. Holmes, you have got the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are singular, not to say grotesque,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;May I ask whether the two busts
</p>
<p>511</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Six Napoleons
</p>
<p>smashed in Dr. Barnicot&#8217;s rooms were the ex-
act duplicates of the one which was destroyed in
Morse Hudson&#8217;s shop?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were taken from the same mould.&#8221;
&#8220;Such a fact must tell against the theory that
</p>
<p>the man who breaks them is influenced by any
general hatred of Napoleon. Considering how
many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor
must exist in London, it is too much to suppose
such a coincidence as that a promiscuous icono-
clast should chance to begin upon three specimens
of the same bust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought as you do,&#8221; said Lestrade. &#8220;On
the other hand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor
of busts in that part of London, and these three
were the only ones which had been in his shop for
years. So, although, as you say, there are many
hundreds of statues in London, it is very probable
that these three were the only ones in that district.
Therefore, a local fanatic would begin with them.
What do you think, Dr. Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no limits to the possibilities of
monomania,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;There is the condi-
tion which the modern French psychologists have
called the &#8216;ide&#180;e fixe,&#8217; which may be trifling in char-
acter, and accompanied by complete sanity in ev-
ery other way. A man who had read deeply about
Napoleon, or who had possibly received some
hereditary family injury through the great war,
might conceivably form such an ide&#180;e fixe and under
its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do, my dear Watson,&#8221; said
Holmes, shaking his head; &#8220;for no amount of ide&#180;e
fixe would enable your interesting monomaniac to
find out where these busts were situated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how do you explain it?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t attempt to do so. I would only ob-
</p>
<p>serve that there is a certain method in the gentle-
man&#8217;s eccentric proceedings. For example, in Dr.
Barnicot&#8217;s hall, where a sound might arouse the
family, the bust was taken outside before being
broken, whereas in the surgery, where there was
less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it
stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and yet
I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some
of my most classic cases have had the least promis-
ing commencement. You will remember, Watson,
how the dreadful business of the Abernetty family
was first brought to my notice by the depth which
the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot
day. I can&#8217;t afford, therefore, to smile at your three
broken busts, Lestrade, and I shall be very much
obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh
developments of so singular a chain of events.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The development for which my friend had
asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more
tragic form than he could have imagined. I was
still dressing in my bedroom next morning when
there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a
telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kens-
ington.
</p>
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Lestrade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t know&#8212;may be anything. But I suspect
</p>
<p>it is the sequel of the story of the statues. In that
case our friend, the image-breaker, has begun op-
erations in another quarter of London. There&#8217;s cof-
fee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the
door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a
quiet little backwater just beside one of the brisk-
est currents of London life. No. 131 was one of a
row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unro-
mantic dwellings. As we drove up we found the
railings in front of the house lined by a curious
crowd. Holmes whistled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George! it&#8217;s attempted murder at the
least. Nothing less will hold the London message-
boy. There&#8217;s a deed of violence indicated in that
fellow&#8217;s round shoulders and outstretched neck.
What&#8217;s this, Watson? The top steps swilled down
and the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, any-
how! Well, well, there&#8217;s Lestrade at the front win-
dow, and we shall soon know all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The official received us with a very grave face
and showed us into a sitting-room, where an ex-
ceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man, clad
in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and
down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the
house&#8212;Mr. Horace Harker, of the Central Press
Syndicate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Napoleon bust business again,&#8221; said
Lestrade. &#8220;You seemed interested last night, Mr.
Holmes, so I thought perhaps you would be glad
to be present now that the affair has taken a very
much graver turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has it turned to, then?&#8221;
&#8220;To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen exactly what has occurred?&#8221;
The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us
</p>
<p>with a most melancholy face.
&#8220;It&#8217;s an extraordinary thing,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that all
</p>
<p>my life I have been collecting other people&#8217;s news,
and now that a real piece of news has come my
</p>
<p>512</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>own way I am so confused and bothered that I
can&#8217;t put two words together. If I had come in
here as a journalist I should have interviewed my-
self and had two columns in every evening paper.
As it is I am giving away valuable copy by telling
my story over and over to a string of different peo-
ple, and I can make no use of it myself. However,
I&#8217;ve heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and
if you&#8217;ll only explain this queer business I shall be
paid for my trouble in telling you the story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat down and listened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It all seems to centre round that bust of
Napoleon which I bought for this very room about
four months ago. I picked it up cheap from Hard-
ing Brothers, two doors from the High Street Sta-
tion. A great deal of my journalistic work is done
at night, and I often write until the early morn-
ing. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den,
which is at the back of the top of the house, about
three o&#8217;clock, when I was convinced that I heard
some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were
not repeated, and I concluded that they came from
outside. Then suddenly, about five minutes later,
there came a most horrible yell&#8212;the most dreadful
sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring
in my ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with hor-
ror for a minute or two. Then I seized the poker
and went downstairs. When I entered this room
I found the window wide open, and I at once ob-
served that the bust was gone from the mantel-
piece. Why any burglar should take such a thing
passes my understanding, for it was only a plaster
cast and of no real value whatever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see for yourself that anyone going out
through that open window could reach the front
doorstep by taking a long stride. This was clearly
what the burglar had done, so I went round and
opened the door. Stepping out into the dark I
nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there.
I ran back for a light, and there was the poor fel-
low, a great gash in his throat and the whole place
swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees
drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see
him in my dreams. I had just time to blow on my
police-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for
I knew nothing more until I found the policeman
standing over me in the hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who was the murdered man?&#8221; asked
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to show who he was,&#8221; said
Lestrade. &#8220;You shall see the body at the mortuary,
but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a
tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than
</p>
<p>thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not ap-
pear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife
was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether
it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether
it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There
was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his
pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map
of London, and a photograph. Here it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evidently taken by a snap-shot from
a small camera. It represented an alert, sharp-
featured simian man with thick eyebrows, and a
very peculiar projection of the lower part of the
face like the muzzle of a baboon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what became of the bust?&#8221; asked
Holmes, after a careful study of this picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had news of it just before you came. It has
been found in the front garden of an empty house
in Campden House Road. It was broken into frag-
ments. I am going round now to see it. Will you
come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I must just take one look round.&#8221;
He examined the carpet and the window. &#8220;The
fellow had either very long legs or was a most ac-
tive man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;With an area beneath, it was
no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open
that window. Getting back was comparatively sim-
ple. Are you coming with us to see the remains of
your bust, Mr. Harker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself
at a writing-table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must try and make something of it,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;though I have no doubt that the first editions of
the evening papers are out already with full de-
tails. It&#8217;s like my luck! You remember when the
stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only jour-
nalist in the stand, and my journal the only one
that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to
write it. And now I&#8217;ll be too late with a murder
done on my own doorstep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we left the room we heard his pen travelling
shrilly over the foolscap.
</p>
<p>The spot where the fragments of the bust had
been found was only a few hundred yards away.
For the first time our eyes rested upon this present-
ment of the great Emperor, which seemed to raise
such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of
the unknown. It lay scattered in splintered shards
upon the grass. Holmes picked up several of them
and examined them carefully. I was convinced
from his intent face and his purposeful manner
that at last he was upon a clue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Lestrade.
Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>513</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Six Napoleons
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long way to go yet,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
yet&#8212;and yet&#8212;well, we have some suggestive facts
to act upon. The possession of this trifling bust
was worth more in the eyes of this strange crim-
inal than a human life. That is one point. Then
there is the singular fact that he did not break it in
the house, or immediately outside the house, if to
break it was his sole object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was rattled and bustled by meeting this
other fellow. He hardly knew what he was doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s likely enough. But I wish to call
your attention very particularly to the position of
this house in the garden of which the bust was de-
stroyed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade looked about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an empty house, and so he knew that
he would not be disturbed in the garden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but there is another empty house farther
up the street which he must have passed before he
came to this one. Why did he not break it there,
since it is evident that every yard that he carried it
increased the risk of someone meeting him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it up,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our
heads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He could see what he was doing here and he
could not there. That was his reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove! that&#8217;s true,&#8221; said the detective. &#8220;Now
that I come to think of it, Dr. Barnicot&#8217;s bust
was broken not far from his red lamp. Well, Mr.
Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To remember it&#8212;to docket it. We may come
on something later which will bear upon it. What
steps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The most practical way of getting at it, in my
opinion, is to identify the dead man. There should
be no difficulty about that. When we have found
who he is and who his associates are, we should
have a good start in learning what he was doing
in Pitt Street last night, and who it was who met
him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace
Harker. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in
which I should approach the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must not let me influence you in any
way! I suggest that you go on your line and I on
mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each
will supplement the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are going back to Pitt Street you might
see Mr. Horace Harker. Tell him from me that
I have quite made up my mind, and that it is
certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with
Napoleonic delusions was in his house last night.
It will be useful for his article.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade stared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seriously believe that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I? Well, perhaps I don&#8217;t. But I am sure
that it will interest Mr. Horace Harker and the
subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate. Now,
Watson, I think that we shall find that we have
a long and rather complex day&#8217;s work before us.
I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it
convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o&#8217;clock
this evening. Until then I should like to keep this
photograph found in the dead man&#8217;s pocket. It is
possible that I may have to ask your company and
assistance upon a small expedition which will have
be undertaken to-night, if my chain of reasoning
should prove to be correct. Until then, good-bye
and good luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the
High Street, where he stopped at the shop of Hard-
ing Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased.
A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding
would be absent until after noon, and that he was
himself a newcomer who could give us no infor-
mation. Holmes&#8217;s face showed his disappointment
and annoyance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we can&#8217;t expect to have it all our
own way, Watson,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;We must come
back in the afternoon if Mr. Harding will not be
here until then. I am, as you have no doubt sur-
mised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their
source, in order to find if there is not something
peculiar which may account for their remarkable
fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson, of the
Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any
light upon the problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-
dealer&#8217;s establishment. He was a small, stout man
with a red face and a peppery manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;What we pay rates and taxes for I don&#8217;t know,
when any ruffian can come in and break one&#8217;s
goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot
his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot,
that&#8217;s what I make it. No one but an Anarchist
would go about breaking statues. Red republi-
cans, that&#8217;s what I call &#8217;em. Who did I get the
statues from? I don&#8217;t see what that has to do with
</p>
<p>514</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from
Gelder &amp; Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are
a well-known house in the trade, and have been
this twenty years. How many had I? Three&#8212;two
and one are three&#8212;two of Dr. Barnicot&#8217;s and one
smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do
I know that photograph? No, I don&#8217;t. Yes, I do,
though. Why, it&#8217;s Beppo. He was a kind of Ital-
ian piece-work man, who made himself useful in
the shop. He could carve a bit and gild and frame,
and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and
I&#8217;ve heard nothing of him since. No, I don&#8217;t know
where he came from nor where he went to. I have
nothing against him while he was here. He was
gone two days before the bust was smashed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all we could reasonably expect
to get from Morse Hudson,&#8221; said Holmes, as we
emerged from the shop. &#8220;We have this Beppo as a
common factor, both in Kennington and in Kens-
ington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. Now,
Watson, let us make for Gelder &amp; Co., of Stepney,
the source and origin of busts. I shall be surprised
if we don&#8217;t get some help down there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In rapid succession we passed through the
fringe of fashionable London, hotel London, the-
atrical London, literary London, commercial Lon-
don, and, finally, maritime London, till we came
to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls,
where the tenement houses swelter and reek with
the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a broad thorough-
fare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we
found the sculpture works for which we searched.
Outside was a considerable yard full of monumen-
tal masonry. Inside was a large room in which fifty
workers were carving or moulding. The manager,
a big blond German, received us civilly, and gave a
clear answer to all Holmes&#8217;s questions. A reference
to his books showed that hundreds of casts had
been taken from a marble copy of Devine&#8217;s head
of Napoleon, but that the three which had been
sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been
half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to
Harding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no
reason why those six should be different to any of
the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause
why anyone should wish to destroy them&#8212;in fact,
he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was
six shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or
more. The cast was taken in two moulds from
each side of the face, and then these two profiles
of plaster of Paris were joined together to make the
complete bust. The work was usually done by Ital-
ians in the room we were in. When finished the
busts were put on a table in the passage to dry,
</p>
<p>and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell
us.
</p>
<p>But the production of the photograph had a
remarkable effect upon the manager. His face
flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his
blue Teutonic eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the rascal!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Yes, indeed, I know
him very well. This has always been a respectable
establishment, and the only time that we have ever
had the police in it was over this very fellow. It was
more than a year ago now. He knifed another Ital-
ian in the street, and then he came to the works
with the police on his heels, and he was taken
here. Beppo was his name&#8212;his second name I
never knew. Serve me right for engaging a man
with such a face. But he was a good workman,
one of the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he get?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man lived and he got off with a year. I
have no doubt he is out now; but he has not dared
to show his nose here. We have a cousin of his
here, and I dare say he could tell you where he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Holmes, &#8220;not a word to the
cousin&#8212;not a word, I beg you. The matter is very
important, and the farther I go with it the more
important it seems to grow. When you referred in
your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed
that the date was June 3rd of last year. Could you
give me the date when Beppo was arrested?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,&#8221; the
manager answered. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he continued, after
some turning over of pages, &#8220;he was paid last on
May 20th.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that
I need intrude upon your time and patience any
more.&#8221; With a last word of caution that he should
say nothing as to our researches we turned our
faces westward once more.
</p>
<p>The afternoon was far advanced before we
were able to snatch a hasty luncheon at a restau-
rant. A news-bill at the entrance announced
&#8220;Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,&#8221;
and the contents of the paper showed that Mr. Ho-
race Harker had got his account into print after
all. Two columns were occupied with a highly sen-
sational and flowery rendering of the whole inci-
dent. Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand
and read it while he ate. Once or twice he chuck-
led.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all right, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Listen to
this:
</p>
<p>515</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Six Napoleons
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is satisfactory to know that there can
be no difference of opinion upon this case,
since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most experi-
enced members of the official force, and Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consult-
ing expert, have each come to the conclu-
sion that the grotesque series of incidents,
which have ended in so tragic a fashion,
arise from lunacy rather than from delib-
erate crime. No explanation save mental
aberration can cover the facts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution
if you only know how to use it. And now, if you
have quite finished, we will hark back to Kensing-
ton and see what the manager of Harding Brothers
has to say to the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The founder of that great emporium proved to
be a brisk, crisp little person, very dapper and
quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I have already read the account in
the evening papers. Mr. Horace Harker is a cus-
tomer of ours. We supplied him with the bust
some months ago. We ordered three busts of that
sort from Gelder &amp; Co., of Stepney. They are all
sold now. To whom? Oh, I dare say by consult-
ing our sales book we could very easily tell you.
Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker,
you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Labur-
num Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one
to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading.
No, I have never seen this face which you show
me in the photograph. You would hardly forget
it, would you, sir, for I&#8217;ve seldom seen an uglier.
Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes, sir, we
have several among our workpeople and cleaners.
I dare say they might get a peep at that sales book
if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for
keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it&#8217;s
a very strange business, and I hope that you&#8217;ll let
me know if anything comes of your inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr.
Harding&#8217;s evidence, and I could see that he was
thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were
taking. He made no remark, however, save that,
unless we hurried, we should be late for our ap-
pointment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when we
reached Baker Street the detective was already
there, and we found him pacing up and down
in a fever of impatience. His look of importance
showed that his day&#8217;s work had not been in vain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What luck, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
&#8220;We have had a very busy day, and not en-
</p>
<p>tirely a wasted one,&#8221; my friend explained. &#8220;We
have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale
</p>
<p>manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now
from the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The busts!&#8221; cried Lestrade. &#8220;Well, well, you
have your own methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
and it is not for me to say a word against them,
but I think I have done a better day&#8217;s work than
you. I have identified the dead man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And found a cause for the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an inspector who makes a specialty
of Saffron Hill and the Italian quarter. Well, this
dead man had some Catholic emblem round his
neck, and that, along with his colour, made me
think he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew
him the moment he caught sight of him. His name
is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected
with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret
political society, enforcing its decrees by murder.
Now you see how the affair begins to clear up.
The other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a
member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in
some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Proba-
bly the photograph we found in his pocket is the
man himself, so that he may not knife the wrong
person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a
house, he waits outside for him, and in the scuf-
fle he receives his own death-wound. How is that,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But
I didn&#8217;t quite follow your explanation of the de-
struction of the busts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The busts! You never can get those busts out
of your head. After all, that is nothing; petty
larceny, six months at the most. It is the murder
that we are really investigating, and I tell you that
I am gathering all the threads into my hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the next stage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill
to the Italian quarter, find the man whose photo-
graph we have got, and arrest him on the charge
of murder. Will you come with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. I fancy we can attain our end
in a simpler way. I can&#8217;t say for certain, because
it all depends&#8212;well, it all depends upon a factor
which is completely outside our control. But I have
great hopes&#8212;in fact, the betting is exactly two to
one&#8212;that if you will come with us to-night I shall
be able to help you to lay him by the heels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Italian quarter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>516</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is
more likely to find him. If you will come with me
to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I&#8217;ll promise to go
to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no
harm will be done by the delay. And now I think
that a few hours&#8217; sleep would do us all good, for I
do not propose to leave before eleven o&#8217;clock, and
it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning.
You&#8217;ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are
welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start.
In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
would ring for an express messenger, for I have a
letter to send, and it is important that it should go
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging
among the files of the old daily papers with which
one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes,
but he said nothing to either of us as to the result
of his researches. For my own part, I had followed
step by step the methods by which he had traced
the various windings of this complex case, and,
though I could not yet perceive the goal which we
would reach, I understood clearly that Holmes ex-
pected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt
upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I re-
membered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object
of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and
I could not but admire the cunning with which my
friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening pa-
per, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could
continue his scheme with impunity. I was not sur-
prised when Holmes suggested that I should take
my revolver with me. He had himself picked up
the loaded hunting-crop which was his favourite
weapon.
</p>
<p>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and
in it we drove to a spot at the other side of Ham-
mersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was directed
to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded
road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing
in its own grounds. In the light of a street lamp
we read &#8220;Laburnum Villa&#8221; upon the gate-post of
one of them. The occupants had evidently retired
to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over
the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on
to the garden path. The wooden fence which sep-
arated the grounds from the road threw a dense
black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was
that we crouched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that you&#8217;ll have a long wait,&#8221; Holmes
whispered. &#8220;We may thank our stars that it is
not raining. I don&#8217;t think we can even venture to
smoke to pass the time. However, it&#8217;s a two to one
</p>
<p>chance that we get something to pay us for our
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to
be so long as Holmes had led us to fear, and it
ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. In
an instant, without the least sound to warn us of
his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a
lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an ape,
rushed up the garden path. We saw it whisk past
the light thrown from over the door and disappear
against the black shadow of the house. There was
a long pause, during which we held our breath,
and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our
ears. The window was being opened. The noise
ceased, and again there was a long silence. The
fellow was making his way into the house. We
saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the
room. What he sought was evidently not there, for
again we saw the flash through another blind, and
then through another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get to the open window. We will nab
him as he climbs out,&#8221; Lestrade whispered.
</p>
<p>But before we could move the man had
emerged again. As he came out into the glimmer-
ing patch of light we saw that he carried some-
thing white under his arm. He looked stealthily
all round him. The silence of the deserted street
reassured him. Turning his back upon us he laid
down his burden, and the next instant there was
the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter
and rattle. The man was so intent upon what he
was doing that he never heard our steps as we
stole across the grass plot. With the bound of a
tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later
Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and the
handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him
over I saw a hideous, sallow face, with writhing,
furious features, glaring up at us, and I knew that
it was indeed the man of the photograph whom
we had secured.
</p>
<p>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes
was giving his attention. Squatted on the doorstep,
he was engaged in most carefully examining that
which the man had brought from the house. It was
a bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen
that morning, and it had been broken into similar
fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate
shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from
any other shattered piece of plaster. He had just
completed his examination when the hall lights
flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the
house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers,
presented himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>517</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Six Napoleons
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock
Holmes? I had the note which you sent by the
express messenger, and I did exactly what you
told me. We locked every door on the inside and
awaited developments. Well, I&#8217;m very glad to see
that you have got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen,
that you will come in and have some refreshment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man
into safe quarters, so within a few minutes our cab
had been summoned and we were all four upon
our way to London. Not a word would our cap-
tive say; but he glared at us from the shadow of
his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed
within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry
wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station
to learn that a search of his clothing revealed noth-
ing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife,
the handle of which bore copious traces of recent
blood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Lestrade, as we parted.
&#8220;Hill knows all these gentry, and he will give a
name to him. You&#8217;ll find that my theory of the
Mafia will work out all right. But I&#8217;m sure I am
exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the
workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon
him. I don&#8217;t quite understand it all yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear it is rather too late an hour for expla-
nations,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Besides, there are one or
two details which are not finished off, and it is
one of those cases which are worth working out to
the very end. If you will come round once more
to my rooms at six o&#8217;clock to-morrow I think I
shall be able to show you that even now you have
not grasped the entire meaning of this business,
which presents some features which make it ab-
solutely original in the history of crime. If ever I
permit you to chronicle any more of my little prob-
lems, Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your
pages by an account of the singular adventure of
the Napoleonic busts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we met again next evening Lestrade was
furnished with much information concerning our
prisoner. His name, it appeared, was Beppo, sec-
ond name unknown. He was a well-known ne&#8217;er-
do-well among the Italian colony. He had once
been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest
living, but he had taken to evil courses and had
twice already been in jail&#8212;once for a petty theft
and once, as we had already heard, for stabbing
a fellow-countryman. He could talk English per-
fectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts
were still unknown, and he refused to answer any
questions upon the subject; but the police had dis-
covered that these same busts might very well have
</p>
<p>been made by his own hands, since he was en-
gaged in this class of work at the establishment
of Gelder &amp; Co. To all this information, much of
which we already knew, Holmes listened with po-
lite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could
clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I
detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and ex-
pectation beneath that mask which he was wont to
assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes
brightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A
minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an
elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers
was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an
old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon
the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?&#8221;
My friend bowed and smiled. &#8220;Mr. Sandeford,
</p>
<p>of Reading, I suppose?&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the
</p>
<p>trains were awkward. You wrote to me about a
bust that is in my possession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;I have your letter here. You said, &#8216;I desire to
</p>
<p>possess a copy of Devine&#8217;s Napoleon, and am pre-
pared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is
in your possession.&#8217; Is that right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;
&#8220;I was very much surprised at your letter, for
</p>
<p>I could not imagine how you knew that I owned
such a thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you must have been surprised, but
the explanation is very simple. Mr. Harding, of
Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you their
last copy, and he gave me your address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I
paid for it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he did not.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I am an honest man, though not a very
</p>
<p>rich one. I only gave fifteen shillings for the bust,
and I think you ought to know that before I take
ten pounds from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr.
Sandeford. But I have named that price, so I in-
tend to stick to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes.
I brought the bust up with me, as you asked me to
do. Here it is!&#8221; He opened his bag, and at last we
saw placed upon our table a complete specimen
of that bust which we had already seen more than
once in fragments.
</p>
<p>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid
a ten-pound note upon the table.
</p>
<p>518</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sande-
ford, in the presence of these witnesses. It is sim-
ply to say that you transfer every possible right
that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a me-
thodical man, you see, and you never know what
turn events might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr.
Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a
very good evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock
Holmes&#8217;s movements were such as to rivet our at-
tention. He began by taking a clean white cloth
from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then
he placed his newly-acquired bust in the centre of
the cloth. Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop
and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of
the head. The figure broke into fragments, and
Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.
Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he held
up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was
fixed like a plum in a pudding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;let me introduce you
to the famous black pearl of the Borgias.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and
then, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke
out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of a play.
A flush of colour sprang to Holmes&#8217;s pale cheeks,
and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who
receives the homage of his audience. It was at
such moments that for an instant he ceased to
be a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human
love for admiration and applause. The same sin-
gularly proud and reserved nature which turned
away with disdain from popular notoriety was ca-
pable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous
wonder and praise from a friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is the most fa-
mous pearl now existing in the world, and it has
been my good fortune, by a connected chain of in-
ductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of
Colonna&#8217;s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it
was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six
busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by
Gelder &amp; Co., of Stepney. You will remember,
Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappear-
ance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of
the London police to recover it. I was myself con-
sulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw
any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of
the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved
that she had a brother in London, but we failed to
trace any connection between them. The maid&#8217;s
name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt
in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered
</p>
<p>two nights ago was the brother. I have been look-
ing up the dates in the old files of the paper, and
I find that the disappearance of the pearl was ex-
actly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some
crime of violence, an event which took place in the
factory of Gelder &amp; Co., at the very moment when
these busts were being made. Now you clearly see
the sequence of events, though you see them, of
course, in the inverse order to the way in which
they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the
pearl in his possession. He may have stolen it from
Pietro, he may have been Pietro&#8217;s confederate, he
may have been the go-between of Pietro and his
sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the
correct solution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The main fact is that he had the pearl, and
at that moment, when it was on his person, he
was pursued by the police. He made for the fac-
tory in which he worked, and he knew that he
had only a few minutes in which to conceal this
enormously valuable prize, which would other-
wise be found on him when he was searched. Six
plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the pas-
sage. One of them was still soft. In an instant
Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in
the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a
few touches covered over the aperture once more.
It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could
possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a
year&#8217;s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six
busts were scattered over London. He could not
tell which contained his treasure. Only by break-
ing them could he see. Even shaking would tell
him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was
probable that the pearl would adhere to it&#8212;as, in
fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he
conducted his search with considerable ingenuity
and perseverance. Through a cousin who works
with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had
bought the busts. He managed to find employ-
ment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked
down three of them. The pearl was not there.
Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he suc-
ceeded in finding out where the other three busts
had gone. The first was at Harker&#8217;s. There he was
dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo re-
sponsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed
him in the scuffle which followed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was his confederate why should he carry
his photograph?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a means of tracing him if he wished to in-
quire about him from any third person. That was
the o
