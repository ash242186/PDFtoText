<p>t was in the spring of the year 1894 that
all London was interested, and the fash-
ionable world dismayed, by the murder
of the Honourable Ronald Adair under
</p>
<p>most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The
public has already learned those particulars of the
crime which came out in the police investigation;
but a good deal was suppressed upon that oc-
casion, since the case for the prosecution was so
overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary
to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the
end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply
those missing links which make up the whole of
that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest
in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me
compared to the inconceivable sequel, which af-
forded me the greatest shock and surprise of any
event in my adventurous life. Even now, after
this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think
of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of
joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly sub-
merged my mind. Let me say to that public which
has shown some interest in those glimpses which I
have occasionally given them of the thoughts and
actions of a very remarkable man that they are not
to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge
with them, for I should have considered it my first
duty to have done so had I not been barred by a
positive prohibition from his own lips, which was
only withdrawn upon the third of last month.
</p>
<p>It can be imagined that my close intimacy
with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply
in crime, and that after his disappearance I never
failed to read with care the various problems
which came before the public, and I even at-
tempted more than once for my own private sat-
isfaction to employ his methods in their solution,
though with indifferent success. There was none,
however, which appealed to me like this tragedy
of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the in-
quest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder
against some person or persons unknown, I real-
ized more clearly than I had ever done the loss
which the community had sustained by the death
of Sherlock Holmes. There were points about this
strange business which would, I was sure, have
specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the
police would have been supplemented, or more
probably anticipated, by the trained observation
and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Eu-
rope. All day as I drove upon my round I turned
over the case in my mind, and found no explana-
tion which appeared to me to be adequate. At the
risk of telling a twice-told tale I will recapitulate
the facts as they were known to the public at the
</p>
<p>conclusion of the inquest.
</p>
<p>The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second
son of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time Governor
of one of the Australian Colonies. Adair&#8217;s mother
had returned from Australia to undergo the opera-
tion for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her
daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park
Lane. The youth moved in the best society, had, so
far as was known, no enemies, and no particular
vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Wood-
ley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been bro-
ken off by mutual consent some months before,
and there was no sign that it had left any very pro-
found feeling behind it. For the rest the man&#8217;s life
moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his
habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet
it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that
death came in most strange and unexpected form
between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the
night of March 30, 1894.
</p>
<p>Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing con-
tinually, but never for such stakes as would hurt
him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the
Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was
shown that after dinner on the day of his death
he had played a rubber of whist at the latter
club. He had also played there in the after-
noon. The evidence of those who had played with
him&#8212;Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel
Moran&#8212;showed that the game was whist, and that
there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair
might have lost five pounds, but not more. His for-
tune was a considerable one, and such a loss could
not in any way affect him. He had played nearly
every day at one club or other, but he was a cau-
tious player, and usually rose a winner. It came
out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel
Moran he had actually won as much as four hun-
dred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks
before from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral.
So much for his recent history, as it came out at
the inquest.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the crime he returned from
the club exactly at ten. His mother and sister were
out spending the evening with a relation. The ser-
vant deposed that she heard him enter the front
room on the second floor, generally used as his
sitting-room. She had lit a fire there, and as it
smoked she had opened the window. No sound
was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the
hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her
daughter. Desiring to say good-night, she had at-
tempted to enter her son&#8217;s room. The door was
locked on the inside, and no answer could be got
</p>
<p>421</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Empty House
</p>
<p>to their cries and knocking. Help was obtained
and the door forced. The unfortunate young man
was found lying near the table. His head had been
horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bul-
let, but no weapon of any sort was to be found
in the room. On the table lay two bank-notes for
ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in sil-
ver and gold, the money arranged in little piles
of varying amount. There were some figures also
upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club
friends opposite to them, from which it was con-
jectured that before his death he was endeavouring
to make out his losses or winnings at cards.
</p>
<p>A minute examination of the circumstances
served only to make the case more complex. In
the first place, no reason could be given why the
young man should have fastened the door upon
the inside. There was the possibility that the mur-
derer had done this and had afterwards escaped
by the window. The drop was at least twenty feet,
however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay
beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed
any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there
any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which
separated the house from the road. Apparently,
therefore, it was the young man himself who had
fastened the door. But how did he come by his
death? No one could have climbed up to the win-
dow without leaving traces. Suppose a man had
fired through the window, it would indeed be a
remarkable shot who could with a revolver in-
flict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a
frequented thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand
within a hundred yards of the house. No one had
heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man,
and there the revolver bullet, which had mush-
roomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so in-
flicted a wound which must have caused instanta-
neous death. Such were the circumstances of the
Park Lane Mystery, which were further compli-
cated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have
said, young Adair was not known to have any en-
emy, and no attempt had been made to remove the
money or valuables in the room.
</p>
<p>All day I turned these facts over in my mind,
endeavouring to hit upon some theory which
could reconcile them all, and to find that line of
least resistance which my poor friend had declared
to be the starting-point of every investigation. I
confess that I made little progress. In the evening
I strolled across the Park, and found myself about
six o&#8217;clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane.
A group of loafers upon the pavements, all star-
ing up at a particular window, directed me to the
house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man
</p>
<p>with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected
of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out
some theory of his own, while the others crowded
round to listen to what he said. I got as near him
as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be
absurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. As
I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man,
who had been behind me, and I knocked down
several books which he was carrying. I remember
that as I picked them up I observed the title of one
of them, The Origin of Tree Worship, and it struck me
that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who,
either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of
obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for
the accident, but it was evident that these books
which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very
precious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a
snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I
saw his curved back and white side-whiskers dis-
appear among the throng.
</p>
<p>My observations of No. 427, Park Lane did lit-
tle to clear up the problem in which I was inter-
ested. The house was separated from the street by
a low wall and railing, the whole not more than
five feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for
anyone to get into the garden, but the window was
entirely inaccessible, since there was no water-pipe
or anything which could help the most active man
to climb it. More puzzled than ever I retraced my
steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study
five minutes when the maid entered to say that a
person desired to see me. To my astonishment it
was none other than my strange old book-collector,
his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame
of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen
of them at least, wedged under his right arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re surprised to see me, sir,&#8221; said he, in a
strange, croaking voice.
</p>
<p>I acknowledged that I was.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve a conscience, sir, and when I
</p>
<p>chanced to see you go into this house, as I came
hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I&#8217;ll just
step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him
that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was
not any harm meant, and that I am much obliged
to him for picking up my books.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make too much of a trifle,&#8221; said I. &#8220;May I
ask how you knew who I was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, if it isn&#8217;t too great a liberty, I am a
neighbour of yours, for you&#8217;ll find my little book-
shop at the corner of Church Street, and very
happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect
yourself, sir; here&#8217;s British Birds, and Catullus, and
The Holy War&#8212;a bargain every one of them. With
</p>
<p>422</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>five volumes you could just fill that gap on that
second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind
me. When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was
standing smiling at me across my study table. I
rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in
utter amazement, and then it appears that I must
have fainted for the first and the last time in my
life. Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes,
and when it cleared I found my collar-ends un-
done and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon
my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his
flask in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson,&#8221; said the well-remembered
voice, &#8220;I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no
idea that you would be so affected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I gripped him by the arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Is it really you? Can it in-
deed be that you are alive? Is it possible that you
succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Are you sure that
you are really fit to discuss things? I have given
you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic
reappearance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can
hardly believe my eyes. Good heavens, to think
that you&#8212;you of all men&#8212;should be standing in
my study!&#8221; Again I gripped him by the sleeve and
felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re
not a spirit, anyhow,&#8221; said I. &#8220;My dear chap, I am
overjoyed to see you. Sit down and tell me how
you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his
old nonchalant manner. He was dressed in the
seedy frock-coat of the book merchant, but the rest
of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old
books upon the table. Holmes looked even thinner
and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white
tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life
recently had not been a healthy one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot
off his stature for several hours on end. Now, my
dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations we
have, if I may ask for your co-operation, a hard
and dangerous night&#8217;s work in front of us. Per-
haps it would be better if I gave you an account of
the whole situation when that work is finished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to
hear now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come with me to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you like and where you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is indeed like the old days. We shall have
time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go.
Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious diffi-
culty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason
that I never was in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never were in it?&#8221;
&#8220;No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to
</p>
<p>you was absolutely genuine. I had little doubt that
I had come to the end of my career when I per-
ceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Pro-
fessor Moriarty standing upon the narrow path-
way which led to safety. I read an inexorable pur-
pose in his grey eyes. I exchanged some remarks
with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous
permission to write the short note which you af-
terwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box
and my stick and I walked along the pathway, Mo-
riarty still at my heels. When I reached the end I
stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at
me and threw his long arms around me. He knew
that his own game was up, and was only anxious
to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together
upon the brink of the fall. I have some knowl-
edge, however, of baritsu, or the Japanese system
of wrestling, which has more than once been very
useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he
with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few sec-
onds and clawed the air with both his hands. But
for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and
over he went. With my face over the brink I saw
him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock,
bounded off, and splashed into the water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I listened with amazement to this explanation,
which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his
cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the tracks!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I saw with my own
eyes that two went down the path and none re-
turned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It came about in this way. The instant that the
Professor had disappeared it struck me what a re-
ally extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed
in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only
man who had sworn my death. There were at
least three others whose desire for vengeance upon
me would only be increased by the death of their
leader. They were all most dangerous men. One or
other would certainly get me. On the other hand,
if all the world was convinced that I was dead
they would take liberties, these men, they would
lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could
destroy them. Then it would be time for me to
announce that I was still in the land of the living.
So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had
thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had
reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall.
</p>
<p>423</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Empty House
</p>
<p>&#8220;I stood up and examined the rocky wall be-
hind me. In your picturesque account of the mat-
ter, which I read with great interest some months
later, you assert that the wall was sheer. This was
not literally true. A few small footholds presented
themselves, and there was some indication of a
ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an
obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossi-
ble to make my way along the wet path without
leaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have re-
versed my boots, as I have done on similar occa-
sions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one
direction would certainly have suggested a decep-
tion. On the whole, then, it was best that I should
risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Wat-
son. The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanci-
ful person, but I give you my word that I seemed
to hear Moriarty&#8217;s voice screaming at me out of
the abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More
than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand
or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I
thought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards,
and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and
covered with soft green moss, where I could lie
unseen in the most perfect comfort. There I was
stretched when you, my dear Watson, and all your
following were investigating in the most sympa-
thetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of
my death.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, when you had all formed your in-
evitable and totally erroneous conclusions, you de-
parted for the hotel and I was left alone. I had
imagined that I had reached the end of my adven-
tures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed
me that there were surprises still in store for me.
A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me,
struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm.
For an instant I thought that it was an accident;
but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man&#8217;s
head against the darkening sky, and another stone
struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched,
within a foot of my head. Of course, the mean-
ing of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been
alone. A confederate&#8212;and even that one glance
had told me how dangerous a man that confeder-
ate was&#8212;had kept guard while the Professor had
attacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he
had been a witness of his friend&#8217;s death and of my
escape. He had waited, and then, making his way
round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured
to succeed where his comrade had failed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not take long to think about it, Watson.
Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff, and
I knew that it was the precursor of another stone.
I scrambled down on to the path. I don&#8217;t think I
</p>
<p>could have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred
times more difficult than getting up. But I had
no time to think of the danger, for another stone
sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge
of the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but by the
blessing of God I landed, torn and bleeding, upon
the path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over
the mountains in the darkness, and a week later I
found myself in Florence with the certainty that no
one in the world knew what had become of me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had only one confidant&#8212;my brother My-
croft. I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson,
but it was all-important that it should be thought
I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would
not have written so convincing an account of my
unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it
was true. Several times during the last three years I
have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I
feared lest your affectionate regard for me should
tempt you to some indiscretion which would be-
tray my secret. For that reason I turned away
from you this evening when you upset my books,
for I was in danger at the time, and any show of
surprise and emotion upon your part might have
drawn attention to my identity and led to the most
deplorable and irreparable results. As to Mycroft, I
had to confide in him in order to obtain the money
which I needed. The course of events in London
did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial
of the Moriarty gang left two of its most danger-
ous members, my own most vindictive enemies,
at liberty. I travelled for two years in Tibet, there-
fore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa and
spending some days with the head Llama. You
may have read of the remarkable explorations of
a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that
it never occurred to you that you were receiving
news of your friend. I then passed through Persia,
looked in at Mecca, and paid a short but interest-
ing visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum, the results
of which I have communicated to the Foreign Of-
fice. Returning to France I spent some months in a
research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I con-
ducted in a laboratory at Montpelier, in the South
of France. Having concluded this to my satisfac-
tion, and learning that only one of my enemies was
now left in London, I was about to return when my
movements were hastened by the news of this very
remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only ap-
pealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed
to offer some most peculiar personal opportuni-
ties. I came over at once to London, called in
my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hud-
son into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft
had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as
</p>
<p>424</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson,
that at two o&#8217;clock to-day I found myself in my old
arm-chair in my own old room, and only wishing
that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the
other chair which he has so often adorned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such was the remarkable narrative to which I
listened on that April evening&#8212;a narrative which
would have been utterly incredible to me had it
not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall,
spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had
never thought to see again. In some manner he
had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his
sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in
his words. &#8220;Work is the best antidote to sorrow,
my dear Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I have a piece of
work for us both to-night which, if we can bring
it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a
man&#8217;s life on this planet.&#8221; In vain I begged him to
tell me more. &#8220;You will hear and see enough be-
fore morning,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We have three years
of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until half-
past nine, when we start upon the notable adven-
ture of the empty house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was indeed like old times when, at that hour,
I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my
revolver in my pocket and the thrill of adventure
in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent.
As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his
austere features I saw that his brows were drawn
down in thought and his thin lips compressed. I
knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt
down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but
I was well assured from the bearing of this mas-
ter huntsman that the adventure was a most grave
one, while the sardonic smile which occasionally
broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good
for the object of our quest.
</p>
<p>I had imagined that we were bound for Baker
Street, but Holmes stopped the cab at the cor-
ner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he
stepped out he gave a most searching glance to
right and left, and at every subsequent street cor-
ner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was
not followed. Our route was certainly a singular
one. Holmes&#8217;s knowledge of the byways of Lon-
don was extraordinary, and on this occasion he
passed rapidly, and with an assured step, through
a network of mews and stables the very existence
of which I had never known. We emerged at last
into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses,
which led us into Manchester Street, and so to
Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly down
a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate
into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key
</p>
<p>the back door of a house. We entered together and
he closed it behind us.
</p>
<p>The place was pitch-dark, but it was evident to
me that it was an empty house. Our feet creaked
and crackled over the bare planking, and my out-
stretched hand touched a wall from which the pa-
per was hanging in ribbons. Holmes&#8217;s cold, thin
fingers closed round my wrist and led me for-
wards down a long hall, until I dimly saw the
murky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned
suddenly to the right, and we found ourselves in
a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in
the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the
lights of the street beyond. There was no lamp
near and the window was thick with dust, so that
we could only just discern each other&#8217;s figures
within. My companion put his hand upon my
shoulder and his lips close to my ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where we are?&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;Surely that is Baker Street,&#8221; I answered, star-
</p>
<p>ing through the dim window.
&#8220;Exactly. We are in Camden House, which
</p>
<p>stands opposite to our own old quarters.&#8221;
&#8220;But why are we here?&#8221;
&#8220;Because it commands so excellent a view of
</p>
<p>that picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my
dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window,
taking every precaution not to show yourself, and
then to look up at our old rooms&#8212;the starting-
point of so many of our little adventures? We will
see if my three years of absence have entirely taken
away my power to surprise you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I crept forward and looked across at the famil-
iar window. As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp
and a cry of amazement. The blind was down
and a strong light was burning in the room. The
shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within
was thrown in hard, black outline upon the lumi-
nous screen of the window. There was no mistak-
ing the poise of the head, the squareness of the
shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face
was turned half-round, and the effect was that of
one of those black silhouettes which our grand-
parents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduc-
tion of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out
my hand to make sure that the man himself was
standing beside me. He was quivering with silent
laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;It is marvellous.&#8221;
&#8220;I trust that age doth not wither nor custom
</p>
<p>stale my infinite variety,&#8217;&#8221; said he, and I recognised
in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes

<p>in his own creation. &#8220;It really is rather like me, is
it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be prepared to swear that it was
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur
Oscar Meunier, of Grenoble, who spent some days
in doing the moulding. It is a bust in wax. The rest
I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street
this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest
possible reason for wishing certain people to think
that I was there when I was really elsewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you thought the rooms were watched?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that they were watched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming
society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall.
You must remember that they knew, and only they
knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they be-
lieved that I should come back to my rooms. They
watched them continuously, and this morning they
saw me arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I recognised their sentinel when I
glanced out of my window. He is a harmless
enough fellow, Parker by name, a garroter by
trade, and a remarkable performer upon the Jew&#8217;s
harp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great
deal for the much more formidable person who
was behind him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the
man who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most
cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That
is the man who is after me to-night, Watson, and
that is the man who is quite unaware that we are
after him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend&#8217;s plans were gradually revealing
themselves. From this convenient retreat the
watchers were being watched and the trackers
tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the
bait and we were the hunters. In silence we stood
together in the darkness and watched the hurry-
ing figures who passed and repassed in front of
us. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could
tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were
fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It
was a bleak and boisterous night, and the wind
whistled shrilly down the long street. Many peo-
ple were moving to and fro, most of them muffled
in their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed
to me that I had seen the same figure before, and
I especially noticed two men who appeared to be
</p>
<p>sheltering themselves from the wind in the door-
way of a house some distance up the street. I tried
to draw my companion&#8217;s attention to them, but he
gave a little ejaculation of impatience and contin-
ued to stare into the street. More than once he
fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his
fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he
was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not
working out altogether as he had hoped. At last,
as midnight approached and the street gradually
cleared, he paced up and down the room in un-
controllable agitation. I was about to make some
remark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted
window and again experienced almost as great a
surprise as before. I clutched Holmes&#8217;s arm and
pointed upwards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The shadow has moved!&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>It was, indeed, no longer the profile, but the
back, which was turned towards us.
</p>
<p>Three years had certainly not smoothed the as-
perities of his temper or his impatience with a less
active intelligence than his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it has moved,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Am I
such a farcical bungler, Watson, that I should erect
an obvious dummy and expect that some of the
sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it?
We have been in this room two hours, and Mrs.
Hudson has made some change in that figure eight
times, or once in every quarter of an hour. She
works it from the front so that her shadow may
never be seen. Ah!&#8221; He drew in his breath with
a shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw
his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid
with attention. Outside, the street was absolutely
deserted. Those two men might still be crouching
in the doorway, but I could no longer see them. All
was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow
screen in front of us with the black figure outlined
upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard
that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense sup-
pressed excitement. An instant later he pulled me
back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt
his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which
clutched me were quivering. Never had I known
my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still
stretched lonely and motionless before us.
</p>
<p>But suddenly I was aware of that which his
keener senses had already distinguished. A low,
stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the di-
rection of Baker Street, but from the back of the
very house in which we lay concealed. A door
opened and shut. An instant later steps crept
down the passage&#8212;steps which were meant to be
silent, but which reverberated harshly through the
</p>
<p>426</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>empty house. Holmes crouched back against the
wall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the
handle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom,
I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker
than the blackness of the open door. He stood
for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouch-
ing, menacing, into the room. He was within three
yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced
myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he
had no idea of our presence. He passed close be-
side us, stole over to the window, and very softly
and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank
to the level of this opening the light of the street, no
longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon
his face. The man seemed to be beside himself
with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars
and his features were working convulsively. He
was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose,
a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled mous-
tache. An opera-hat was pushed to the back of
his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed
out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt
and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his
hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but
as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metal-
lic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he
drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some
task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a
spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneel-
ing upon the floor he bent forward and threw all
his weight and strength upon some lever, with the
result that there came a long, whirling, grinding
noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He
straightened himself then, and I saw that what he
held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curi-
ously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech,
put something in, and snapped the breech-block.
Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the
barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I
saw his long moustache droop over the stock and
his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard
a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt
into his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the
black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at
the end of his fore sight. For an instant he was
rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on
the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a
long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant
Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman&#8217;s
back and hurled him flat upon his face. He was up
again in a moment, and with convulsive strength
he seized Holmes by the throat; but I struck him
on the head with the butt of my revolver and he
dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him,
and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call
</p>
<p>upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running
feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in
uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed
through the front entrance and into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Lestrade?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It&#8217;s
good to see you back in London, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you want a little unofficial help.
Three undetected murders in one year won&#8217;t do,
Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery
with less than your usual&#8212;that&#8217;s to say, you han-
dled it fairly well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner
breathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each
side of him. Already a few loiterers had begun to
collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the win-
dow, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade
had produced two candles and the policemen had
uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have
a good look at our prisoner.
</p>
<p>It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister
face which was turned towards us. With the brow
of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist
below, the man must have started with great ca-
pacities for good or for evil. But one could not look
upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cyn-
ical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and
the threatening, deep-lined brow, without read-
ing Nature&#8217;s plainest danger-signals. He took no
heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon
Holmes&#8217;s face with an expression in which ha-
tred and amazement were equally blended. &#8220;You
fiend!&#8221; he kept on muttering. &#8220;You clever, clever
fiend!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Colonel!&#8221; said Holmes, arranging his
rumpled collar; &#8220; &#8216;journeys end in lovers&#8217; meet-
ings,&#8217; as the old play says. I don&#8217;t think I have had
the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me
with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above
the Reichenbach Fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel still stared at my friend like a man
in a trance. &#8220;You cunning, cunning fiend!&#8221; was all
that he could say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not introduced you yet,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;This, gentlemen, is Colonel Sebastian Moran,
once of Her Majesty&#8217;s Indian Army, and the best
heavy game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever
produced. I believe I am correct, Colonel, in saying
that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fierce old man said nothing, but still
glared at my companion; with his savage eyes
and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like
a tiger himself.
</p>
<p>427</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Empty House
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder that my very simple stratagem could
deceive so old a shikari,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;It must
be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a
young kid under a tree, lain above it with your ri-
fle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger?
This empty house is my tree and you are my tiger.
You have possibly had other guns in reserve in
case there should be several tigers, or in the un-
likely supposition of your own aim failing you.
These,&#8221; he pointed around, &#8220;are my other guns.
The parallel is exact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Moran sprang forward, with a snarl of
rage, but the constables dragged him back. The
fury upon his face was terrible to look at.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess that you had one small surprise for
me,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I did not anticipate that you
would yourself make use of this empty house and
this convenient front window. I had imagined
you as operating from the street, where my friend
Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you.
With that exception all has gone as I expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may or may not have just cause for ar-
resting me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but at least there can be no
reason why I should submit to the gibes of this
person. If I am in the hands of the law let things
be done in a legal way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s reasonable enough,&#8221; said
Lestrade. &#8220;Nothing further you have to say, Mr.
Holmes, before we go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun
from the floor and was examining its mechanism.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An admirable and unique weapon,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;noiseless and of tremendous power. I knew Von
Herder, the blind German mechanic, who con-
structed it to the order of the late Professor Mo-
riarty. For years I have been aware of its existence,
though I have never before had the opportunity of
handling it. I commend it very specially to your
attention, Lestrade, and also the bullets which fit
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust us to look after that, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said Lestrade, as the whole party moved
towards the door. &#8220;Anything further to say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to ask what charge you intend to pre-
fer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What charge, sir? Why, of course, the at-
tempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear
in the matter at all. To you, and to you only, be-
longs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you
have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you!
</p>
<p>With your usual happy mixture of cunning and
audacity you have got him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man that the whole force has been seek-
ing in vain&#8212;Colonel Sebastian Moran, who shot
the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding
bullet from an air-gun through the open window
of the second-floor front of No. 427, Park Lane,
upon the 30th of last month. That&#8217;s the charge,
Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you can endure the
draught from a broken window, I think that half
an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you
some profitable amusement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our old chambers had been left unchanged
through the supervision of Mycroft Holmes and
the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I en-
tered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but
the old landmarks were all in their place. There
were the chemical corner and the acid-stained,
deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the
row of formidable scrap-books and books of ref-
erence which many of our fellow-citizens would
have been so glad to burn. The diagrams, the
violin-case, and the pipe-rack&#8212;even the Persian
slipper which contained the tobacco&#8212;all met my
eyes as I glanced round me. There were two
occupants of the room&#8212;one Mrs. Hudson, who
beamed upon us both as we entered; the other
the strange dummy which had played so impor-
tant a part in the evening&#8217;s adventures. It was a
wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably
done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a
small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of
Holmes&#8217;s so draped round it that the illusion from
the street was absolutely perfect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you preserved all precautions, Mrs.
Hudson?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent. You carried the thing out very well.
Did you observe where the bullet went?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I&#8217;m afraid it has spoilt your beauti-
ful bust, for it passed right through the head and
flattened itself on the wall. I picked it up from the
carpet. Here it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes held it out to me. &#8220;A soft revolver bul-
let, as you perceive, Watson. There&#8217;s genius in
that, for who would expect to find such a thing
fired from an air-gun. All right, Mrs. Hudson, I
am much obliged for your assistance. And now,
Watson, let me see you in your old seat once more,
for there are several points which I should like to
discuss with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>428</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>He had thrown off the seedy frock-coat, and
now he was the Holmes of old in the mouse-
coloured dressing-gown which he took from his
effigy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old shikari&#8217;s nerves have not lost their
steadiness nor his eyes their keenness,&#8221; said he,
with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered fore-
head of his bust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plumb in the middle of the back of the head
and smack through the brain. He was the best shot
in India, and I expect that there are few better in
London. Have you heard the name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remem-
ber aright, you had not heard the name of Pro-
fessor James Moriarty, who had one of the great
brains of the century. Just give me down my index
of biographies from the shelf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in
his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My collection of M&#8217;s is a fine one,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter il-
lustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner, and
Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews,
who knocked out my left canine in the waiting-
room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our
friend of to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed over the book, and I read:
</p>
<p>Moran, Sebastian, Colonel. Unem-
ployed. Formerly 1st Bengalore Pi-
oneers. Born London, 1840. Son
of Sir Augustus Moran, C.B., once
British Minister to Persia. Edu-
cated Eton and Oxford. Served in
Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign,
Charasiab (despatches), Sherpur, and
Cabul. Author of Heavy Game of the
Western Himalayas, 1881; Three Months
in the Jungle, 1884. Address: Conduit
Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the
Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club.
</p>
<p>On the margin was written, in Holmes&#8217;s precise
hand:
</p>
<p>The second most dangerous man in
London.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is astonishing,&#8221; said I, as I handed back
the volume. &#8220;The man&#8217;s career is that of an hon-
ourable soldier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;Up to a cer-
tain point he did well. He was always a man of
</p>
<p>iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how
he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-
eating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which
grow to a certain height and then suddenly de-
velop some unsightly eccentricity. You will see it
often in humans. I have a theory that the individ-
ual represents in his development the whole pro-
cession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden
turn to good or evil stands for some strong influ-
ence which came into the line of his pedigree. The
person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the his-
tory of his own family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is surely rather fanciful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t insist upon it. Whatever the
cause, Colonel Moran began to go wrong. With-
out any open scandal he still made India too hot to
hold him. He retired, came to London, and again
acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he
was sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for
a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied
him liberally with money and used him only in
one or two very high-class jobs which no ordinary
criminal could have undertaken. You may have
some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of
Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am sure Moran was
at the bottom of it; but nothing could be proved.
So cleverly was the Colonel concealed that even
when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could
not incriminate him. You remember at that date,
when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put
up the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you
thought me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was
doing, for I knew of the existence of this remark-
able gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots
in the world would be behind it. When we were
in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and
it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five
minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think that I read the papers with
some attention during my sojourn in France, on
the look-out for any chance of laying him by the
heels. So long as he was free in London my l
