<p>have never known my friend to be in
better form, both mental and physical,
than in the year &#8217;95. His increasing fame
had brought with it an immense prac-
</p>
<p>tice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I
were even to hint at the identity of some of the il-
lustrious clients who crossed our humble thresh-
old in Baker Street. Holmes, however, like all
great artists, lived for his art&#8217;s sake, and, save in
the case of the Duke of Holdernesse, I have sel-
dom known him claim any large reward for his
inestimable services. So unworldly was he&#8212;or
so capricious&#8212;that he frequently refused his help
to the powerful and wealthy where the problem
made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would
devote weeks of most intense application to the af-
fairs of some humble client whose case presented
those strange and dramatic qualities which ap-
pealed to his imagination and challenged his in-
genuity.
</p>
<p>In this memorable year &#8217;95 a curious and in-
congruous succession of cases had engaged his at-
tention, ranging from his famous investigation of
the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca&#8212;an inquiry
which was carried out by him at the express de-
sire of His Holiness the Pope&#8212;down to his arrest
of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which re-
moved a plague-spot from the East-End of Lon-
don. Close on the heels of these two famous
cases came the tragedy of Woodman&#8217;s Lee, and the
very obscure circumstances which surrounded the
death of Captain Peter Carey. No record of the do-
ings of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete
which did not include some account of this very
unusual affair.
</p>
<p>During the first week of July my friend had
been absent so often and so long from our lodg-
ings that I knew he had something on hand. The
fact that several rough-looking men called during
that time and inquired for Captain Basil made me
understand that Holmes was working somewhere
under one of the numerous disguises and names
with which he concealed his own formidable iden-
tity. He had at least five small refuges in different
parts of London in which he was able to change
his personality. He said nothing of his business to
me, and it was not my habit to force a confidence.
The first positive sign which he gave me of the di-
rection which his investigation was taking was an
extraordinary one. He had gone out before break-
fast, and I had sat down to mine, when he strode
into the room, his hat upon his head and a huge
barbed-headed spear tucked like an umbrella un-
der his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Holmes!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean to say that you have been walking about
London with that thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove to the butcher&#8217;s and back.&#8221;
&#8220;The butcher&#8217;s?&#8221;
&#8220;And I return with an excellent appetite. There
</p>
<p>can be no question, my dear Watson, of the value
of exercise before breakfast. But I am prepared to
bet that you will not guess the form that my exer-
cise has taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not attempt it.&#8221;
He chuckled as he poured out the coffee.
&#8220;If you could have looked into Allardyce&#8217;s back
</p>
<p>shop you would have seen a dead pig swung from
a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt-
sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon.
I was that energetic person, and I have satisfied
myself that by no exertion of my strength can I
transfix the pig with a single blow. Perhaps you
would care to try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for worlds. But why were you doing
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it seemed to me to have an indirect
bearing upon the mystery of Woodman&#8217;s Lee. Ah,
Hopkins, I got your wire last night, and I have
been expecting you. Come and join us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor was an exceedingly alert man,
thirty years of age, dressed in a quiet tweed suit,
but retaining the erect bearing of one who was ac-
customed to official uniform. I recognised him at
once as Stanley Hopkins, a young police inspector
for whose future Holmes had high hopes, while
he in turn professed the admiration and respect
of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous
amateur. Hopkins&#8217;s brow was clouded, and he sat
down with an air of deep dejection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, sir. I breakfasted before I came
round. I spent the night in town, for I came up yes-
terday to report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what had you to report?&#8221;
&#8220;Failure, sir; absolute failure.&#8221;
&#8220;You have made no progress?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me! I must have a look at the matter.&#8221;
&#8220;I wish to heavens that you would, Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my first big chance, and I am at my wit&#8217;s end.
For goodness&#8217; sake come down and lend me a
hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, it just happens that I have already
read all the available evidence, including the re-
port of the inquest, with some care. By the way,
what do you make of that tobacco-pouch found
on the scene of the crime? Is there no clue there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>489</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Black Peter
</p>
<p>Hopkins looked surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the man&#8217;s own pouch, sir. His initials
were inside it. And it was of seal-skin&#8212;and he an
old sealer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he had no pipe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, we could find no pipe; indeed, he
smoked very little. And yet he might have kept
some tobacco for his friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt. I only mention it because if I had
been handling the case I should have been inclined
to make that the starting-point of my investigation.
However, my friend Dr. Watson knows nothing of
this matter, and I should be none the worse for
hearing the sequence of events once more. Just
give us some short sketch of the essentials.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a few dates here which will give you the
career of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. He
was born in &#8217;45&#8212;fifty years of age. He was a most
daring and successful seal and whale fisher. In
1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn,
of Dundee. He had then had several successful
voyages in succession, and in the following year,
1884, he retired. After that he travelled for some
years, and finally he bought a small place called
Woodman&#8217;s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There
he has lived for six years, and there he died just a
week ago to-day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were some most singular points about
the man. In ordinary life he was a strict Puritan&#8212;a
silent, gloomy fellow. His household consisted of
his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two fe-
male servants. These last were continually chang-
ing, for it was never a very cheery situation, and
sometimes it became past all bearing. The man
was an intermittent drunkard, and when he had
the fit on him he was a perfect fiend. He has been
known to drive his wife and his daughter out of
doors in the middle of the night, and flog them
through the park until the whole village outside
the gates was aroused by their screams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was summoned once for a savage assault
upon the old vicar, who had called upon him to
remonstrate with him upon his conduct. In short,
Mr. Holmes, you would go far before you found
a more dangerous man than Peter Carey, and I
have heard that he bore the same character when
he commanded his ship. He was known in the
trade as Black Peter, and the name was given him,
not only on account of his swarthy features and
the colour of his huge beard, but for the humours
which were the terror of all around him. I need
</p>
<p>not say that he was loathed and avoided by every
one of his neighbours, and that I have not heard
one single word of sorrow about his terrible end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have read in the account of the in-
quest about the man&#8217;s cabin, Mr. Holmes; but per-
haps your friend here has not heard of it. He
had built himself a wooden outhouse&#8212;he always
called it &#8216;the cabin&#8217;&#8212;a few hundred yards from his
house, and it was here that he slept every night.
It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by
ten. He kept the key in his pocket, made his own
bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot
to cross the threshold. There are small windows
on each side, which were covered by curtains and
never opened. One of these windows was turned
towards the high road, and when the light burned
in it at night the folk used to point it out to each
other and wonder what Black Peter was doing in
there. That&#8217;s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave
us one of the few bits of positive evidence that
came out at the inquest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember that a stonemason, named
Slater, walking from Forest Row about one
o&#8217;clock in the morning&#8212;two days before the
murder&#8212;stopped as he passed the grounds and
looked at the square of light still shining among
the trees. He swears that the shadow of a man&#8217;s
head turned sideways was clearly visible on the
blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that
of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that
of a bearded man, but the beard was short and
bristled forwards in a way very different from that
of the captain. So he says, but he had been two
hours in the public-house, and it is some distance
from the road to the window. Besides, this refers
to the Monday, and the crime was done upon the
Wednesday.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Tuesday Peter Carey was in one of his
blackest moods, flushed with drink and as savage
as a dangerous wild beast. He roamed about the
house, and the women ran for it when they heard
him coming. Late in the evening he went down
to his own hut. About two o&#8217;clock the following
morning his daughter, who slept with her window
open, heard a most fearful yell from that direc-
tion, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl
and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was
taken. On rising at seven one of the maids noticed
that the door of the hut was open, but so great
was the terror which the man caused that it was
midday before anyone would venture down to see
what had become of him. Peeping into the open
door they saw a sight which sent them flying with
white faces into the village. Within an hour I was
on the spot and had taken over the case.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know,
Mr. Holmes, but I give you my word that I got a
shake when I put my head into that little house.
It was droning like a harmonium with the flies
and bluebottles, and the floor and walls were like
a slaughter-house. He had called it a cabin, and
a cabin it was sure enough, for you would have
thought that you were in a ship. There was a bunk
at one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture
of the Sea Unicorn, a line of log-books on a shelf, all
exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain&#8217;s
room. And there in the middle of it was the man
himself, his face twisted like a lost soul in torment,
and his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his
agony. Right through his broad breast a steel har-
poon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into
the wood of the wall behind him. He was pinned
like a beetle on a card. Of course, he was quite
dead, and had been so from the instant that he
had uttered that last yell of agony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your methods, sir, and I applied them.
Before I permitted anything to be moved I exam-
ined most carefully the ground outside, and also
the floor of the room. There were no footmarks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that you saw none?&#8221;
&#8220;I assure you, sir, that there were none.&#8221;
&#8220;My good Hopkins, I have investigated many
</p>
<p>crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was
committed by a flying creature. As long as the
criminal remains upon two legs so long must there
be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling
displacement which can be detected by the sci-
entific searcher. It is incredible that this blood-
bespattered room contained no trace which could
have aided us. I understand, however, from the
inquest that there were some objects which you
failed to overlook?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young inspector winced at my compan-
ion&#8217;s ironical comments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a fool not to call you in at the time,
Mr. Holmes. However, that&#8217;s past praying for now.
Yes, there were several objects in the room which
called for special attention. One was the harpoon
with which the deed was committed. It had been
snatched down from a rack on the wall. Two oth-
ers remained there, and there was a vacant place
for the third. On the stock was engraved &#8216;S.S.. Sea
Unicorn, Dundee.&#8217; This seemed to establish that
the crime had been done in a moment of fury,
and that the murderer had seized the first weapon
which came in his way. The fact that the crime
was committed at two in the morning, and yet Pe-
ter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had
an appointment with the murderer, which is borne
</p>
<p>out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty
glasses stood upon the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Holmes; &#8220;I think that both infer-
ences are permissible. Was there any other spirit
but rum in the room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; there was a tantalus containing brandy
and whisky on the sea-chest. It is of no impor-
tance to us, however, since the decanters were full,
and it had therefore not been used.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For all that its presence has some signifi-
cance,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;However, let us hear some
more about the objects which do seem to you to
bear upon the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.&#8221;
&#8220;What part of the table?&#8221;
&#8220;It lay in the middle. It was of coarse
</p>
<p>seal-skin&#8212;the straight-haired skin, with a leather
thong to bind it. Inside was &#8216;P.C.&#8217; on the flap.
There was half an ounce of strong ship&#8217;s tobacco
in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent! What more?&#8221;
Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-
</p>
<p>covered note-book. The outside was rough and
worn, the leaves discoloured. On the first page
were written the initials &#8220;J.H.N.&#8221; and the date
&#8220;1883.&#8221; Holmes laid it on the table and examined
it in his minute way, while Hopkins and I gazed
over each shoulder. On the second page were
the printed letters &#8220;C.P.R.,&#8221; and then came several
sheets of numbers. Another heading was Argen-
tine, another Costa Rica, and another San Paulo,
each with pages of signs and figures after it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of these?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange se-
</p>
<p>curities. I thought that &#8216;J.H.N.&#8217; were the initials
of a broker, and that &#8216;C.P.R.&#8217; may have been his
client.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try Canadian Pacific Railway,&#8221; said Holmes.
Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth and
</p>
<p>struck his thigh with his clenched hand.
&#8220;What a fool I have been!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Of course,
</p>
<p>it is as you say. Then &#8216;J.H.N.&#8217; are the only ini-
tials we have to solve. I have already examined
the old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one
in 1883 either in the House or among the outside
brokers whose initials correspond with these. Yet
I feel that the clue is the most important one that
I hold. You will admit, Mr. Holmes, that there is
a possibility that these initials are those of the sec-
ond person who was present&#8212;in other words, of
the murderer. I would also urge that the introduc-
tion into the case of a document relating to large
</p>
<p>491</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Black Peter
</p>
<p>masses of valuable securities gives us for the first
time some indication of a motive for the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s face showed that he was
thoroughly taken aback by this new development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must admit both your points,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
confess that this note-book, which did not appear
at the inquest, modifies any views which I may
have formed. I had come to a theory of the crime
in which I can find no place for this. Have you en-
deavoured to trace any of the securities here men-
tioned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Inquiries are now being made at the offices,
but I fear that the complete register of the stock-
holders of these South American concerns is in
South America, and that some weeks must elapse
before we can trace the shares.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had been examining the cover of the
note-book with his magnifying lens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely there is some discolouration here,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. I told you that I
picked the book off the floor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the blood-stain above or below?&#8221;
&#8220;On the side next the boards.&#8221;
&#8220;Which proves, of course, that the book was
</p>
<p>dropped after the crime was committed.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated that point,
</p>
<p>and I conjectured that it was dropped by the mur-
derer in his hurried flight. It lay near the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that none of these securities have
been found among the property of the dead man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you any reason to suspect robbery?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir. Nothing seemed to have been
</p>
<p>touched.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case.
</p>
<p>Then there was a knife, was there not?&#8221;
&#8220;A sheath-knife, still in its sheath. It lay at the
</p>
<p>feet of the dead man. Mrs. Carey has identified it
as being her husband&#8217;s property.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was lost in thought for some time.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, at last, &#8220;I suppose I shall have
</p>
<p>to come out and have a look at it.&#8221;
Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.
&#8220;Thank you, sir. That will indeed be a weight
</p>
<p>off my mind.&#8221;
Holmes shook his finger at the inspector.
&#8220;It would have been an easier task a week ago,&#8221;
</p>
<p>said he. &#8220;But even now my visit may not be en-
tirely fruitless. Watson, if you can spare the time I
</p>
<p>should be very glad of your company. If you will
call a four-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to
start for Forest Row in a quarter of an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alighting at the small wayside station, we
drove for some miles through the remains of
widespread woods, which were once part of that
great forest which for so long held the Saxon in-
vaders at bay&#8212;the impenetrable &#8220;weald,&#8221; for sixty
years the bulwark of Britain. Vast sections of it
have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first
iron-works of the country, and the trees have been
felled to smelt the ore. Now the richer fields of
the North have absorbed the trade, and nothing
save these ravaged groves and great scars in the
earth show the work of the past. Here in a clear-
ing upon the green slope of a hill stood a long,
low stone house, approached by a curving drive
running through the fields. Nearer the road, and
surrounded on three sides by bushes, was a small
outhouse, one window and the door facing in our
direction. It was the scene of the murder.
</p>
<p>Stanley Hopkins led us first to the house,
where he introduced us to a haggard, grey-haired
woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose
gaunt and deep-lined face, with the furtive look of
terror in the depths of her red-rimmed eyes, told
of the years of hardship and ill-usage which she
had endured. With her was her daughter, a pale,
fair-haired girl, whose eyes blazed defiantly at us
as she told us that she was glad that her father
was dead, and that she blessed the hand which
had struck him down. It was a terrible household
that Black Peter Carey had made for himself, and it
was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves
in the sunlight again and making our way along a
path which had been worn across the fields by the
feet of the dead man.
</p>
<p>The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings,
wooden-walled, shingle-roofed, one window be-
side the door and one on the farther side. Stanley
Hopkins drew the key from his pocket, and had
stooped to the lock, when he paused with a look
of attention and surprise upon his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has been tampering with it,&#8221; he said.
There could be no doubt of the fact. The wood-
</p>
<p>work was cut and the scratches showed white
through the paint, as if they had been that instant
done. Holmes had been examining the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has tried to force this also. Whoever
it was has failed to make his way in. He must have
been a very poor burglar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a most extraordinary thing,&#8221; said the
inspector; &#8220;I could swear that these marks were
not here yesterday evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>492</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Some curious person from the village, per-
haps,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very unlikely. Few of them would dare to
set foot in the grounds, far less try to force their
way into the cabin. What do you think of it, Mr.
Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that fortune is very kind to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that the person will come again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very probable. He came expecting to find
the door open. He tried to get in with the blade
of a very small penknife. He could not manage it.
What would he do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come again next night with a more useful
tool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should say. It will be our fault if we are
not there to receive him. Meanwhile, let me see
the inside of the cabin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The traces of the tragedy had been removed,
but the furniture within the little room still stood
as it had been on the night of the crime. For two
hours, with most intense concentration, Holmes
examined every object in turn, but his face showed
that his quest was not a successful one. Once only
he paused in his patient investigation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you taken anything off this shelf, Hop-
kins?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I have moved nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has been taken. There is less dust
in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere. It may
have been a book lying on its side. It may have
been a box. Well, well, I can do nothing more. Let
us walk in these beautiful woods, Watson, and give
a few hours to the birds and the flowers. We shall
meet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can
come to closer quarters with the gentleman who
has paid this visit in the night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was past eleven o&#8217;clock when we formed
our little ambuscade. Hopkins was for leaving
the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the
opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the
stranger. The lock was a perfectly simple one, and
only a strong blade was needed to push it back.
Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not
inside the hut, but outside it among the bushes
which grew round the farther window. In this way
we should be able to watch our man if he struck a
light, and see what his object was in this stealthy
nocturnal visit.
</p>
<p>It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet
brought with it something of the thrill which the
hunter feels when he lies beside the water pool
and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of
</p>
<p>prey. What savage creature was it which might
steal upon us out of the darkness? Was it a fierce
tiger of crime, which could only be taken fight-
ing hard with flashing fang and claw, or would it
prove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only
to the weak and unguarded?
</p>
<p>In absolute silence we crouched amongst the
bushes, waiting for whatever might come. At first
the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of
voices from the village, lightened our vigil; but one
by one these interruptions died away and an abso-
lute stillness fell upon us, save for the chimes of
the distant church, which told us of the progress
of the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a
fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us
in.
</p>
<p>Half-past two had chimed, and it was the dark-
est hour which precedes the dawn, when we all
started as a low but sharp click came from the di-
rection of the gate. Someone had entered the drive.
Again there was a long silence, and I had begun to
fear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step
was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a
moment later a metallic scraping and clinking. The
man was trying to force the lock! This time his skill
was greater or his tool was better, for there was a
sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. Then
a match was struck, and next instant the steady
light from a candle filled the interior of the hut.
Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riv-
eted upon the scene within.
</p>
<p>The nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail
and thin, with a black moustache which intensified
the deadly pallor of his face. He could not have
been much above twenty years of age. I have never
seen any human being who appeared to be in such
a pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chatter-
ing and he was shaking in every limb. He was
dressed like a gentleman, in Norfolk jacket and
knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head.
We watched him staring round with frightened
eyes. Then he laid the candle-end upon the ta-
ble and disappeared from our view into one of the
corners. He returned with a large book, one of the
log-books which formed a line upon the shelves.
Leaning on the table he rapidly turned over the
leaves of this volume until he came to the entry
which he sought. Then, with an angry gesture of
his clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it
in the corner, and put out the light. He had hardly
turned to leave the hut when Hopkins&#8217;s hand was
on the fellow&#8217;s collar, and I heard his loud gasp
of terror as he understood that he was taken. The

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Black Peter
</p>
<p>candle was re-lit, and there was our wretched cap-
tive shivering and cowering in the grasp of the de-
tective. He sank down upon the sea-chest, and
looked helplessly from one of us to the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my fine fellow,&#8221; said Stanley Hopkins,
&#8220;who are you, and what do you want here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man pulled himself together and faced us
with an effort at self-composure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are detectives, I suppose?&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
imagine I am connected with the death of Captain
Peter Carey. I assure you that I am innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; said Hopkins. &#8220;First of
all, what is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is John Hopley Neligan.&#8221;
I saw Holmes and Hopkins exchange a quick
</p>
<p>glance.
&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;
&#8220;Can I speak confidentially?&#8221;
&#8220;No, certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;Why should I tell you?&#8221;
&#8220;If you have no answer it may go badly with
</p>
<p>you at the trial.&#8221;
The young man winced.
&#8220;Well, I will tell you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why should
</p>
<p>I not? And yet I hate to think of this old scandal
gaining a new lease of life. Did you ever hear of
Dawson and Neligan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see from Hopkins&#8217;s face that he never
had; but Holmes was keenly interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the West-country bankers,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;They failed for a million, ruined half the county
families of Cornwall, and Neligan disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Neligan was my father.&#8221;
At last we were getting something positive, and
</p>
<p>yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding
banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against
the wall with one of his own harpoons. We all
listened intently to the young man&#8217;s words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my father who was really concerned.
Dawson had retired. I was only ten years of age at
the time, but I was old enough to feel the shame
and horror of it all. It has always been said that
my father stole all the securities and fled. It is not
true. It was his belief that if he were given time in
which to realize them all would be well and every
creditor paid in full. He started in his little yacht
for Norway just before the warrant was issued for
his arrest. I can remember that last night when
he bade farewell to my mother. He left us a list
of the securities he was taking, and he swore that
he would come back with his honour cleared, and
</p>
<p>that none who had trusted him would suffer. Well,
no word was ever heard from him again. Both the
yacht and he vanished utterly. We believed, my
mother and I, that he and it, with the securities
that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of
the sea. We had a faithful friend, however, who is a
business man, and it was he who discovered some
time ago that some of the securities which my fa-
ther had with him have reappeared on the London
market. You can imagine our amazement. I spent
months in trying to trace them, and at last, after
many doublings and difficulties, I discovered that
the original seller had been Captain Peter Carey,
the owner of this hut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, I made some inquiries about the
man. I found that he had been in command of
a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic
seas at the very time when my father was cross-
ing to Norway. The autumn of that year was a
stormy one, and there was a long succession of
southerly gales. My father&#8217;s yacht may well have
been blown to the north, and there met by Captain
Peter Carey&#8217;s ship. If that were so, what had be-
come of my father? In any case, if I could prove
from Peter Carey&#8217;s evidence how these securities
came on the market it would be a proof that my
father had not sold them, and that he had no view
to personal profit when he took them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came down to Sussex with the intention of
seeing the captain, but it was at this moment that
his terrible death occurred. I read at the inquest a
description of his cabin, in which it stated that the
old log-books of his vessel were preserved in it. It
struck me that if I could see what occurred in the
month of August, 1883, on board the Sea Unicorn, I
might settle the mystery of my father&#8217;s fate. I tried
last night to get at these log-books, but was unable
to open the door. To-night I tried again, and suc-
ceeded; but I find that the pages which deal with
that month have been torn from the book. It was
at that moment I found myself a prisoner in your
hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked Hopkins.
&#8220;Yes, that is all.&#8221; His eyes shifted as he said it.
&#8220;You have nothing else to tell us?&#8221;
He hesitated.
&#8220;No; there is nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;You have not been here before last night?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Then how do you account for that?&#8221; cried
</p>
<p>Hopkins, as he held up the damning note-book,
with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf
and the blood-stain on the cover.
</p>
<p>494</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The wretched man collapsed. He sank his face
in his hands and trembled all over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;I did not
know. I thought I had lost it at the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is enough,&#8221; said Hopkins, sternly.
&#8220;Whatever else you have to say you must say in
court. You will walk down with me now to the
police-station. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am very much
obliged to you and to your friend for coming down
to help me. As it turns out your presence was un-
necessary, and I would have brought the case to
this successful issue without you; but none the less
I am very grateful. Rooms have been reserved for
you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can all walk
down to the village together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, what do you think of it?&#8221; asked
Holmes, as we travelled back next morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that you are not satisfied.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satis-
</p>
<p>fied. At the same time Stanley Hopkins&#8217;s methods
do not commend themselves to me. I am disap-
pointed in Stanley Hopkins. I had hoped for bet-
ter things from him. One should always look for
a possible alternative and provide against it. It is
the first rule of criminal investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, then, is the alternative?&#8221;
&#8220;The line of investigation which I have myself
</p>
<p>been pursuing. It may give us nothing. I cannot
tell. But at least I shall follow it to the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Several letters were waiting for Holmes at
Baker Street. He snatched one of them up, opened
it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of
laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson. The alternative develops.
Have you telegraph forms? Just write a couple of
messages for me: &#8216;Sumner, Shipping Agent, Rat-
cliff Highway. Send three men on, to arrive ten
to-morrow morning.&#8212;Basil.&#8217; That&#8217;s my name in
those parts. The other is: &#8216;Inspector Stanley Hop-
kins, 46, Lord Street, Brixton. Come breakfast
to-morrow at nine-thirty. Important. Wire if un-
able to come.&#8212;Sherlock Holmes.&#8217; There, Watson,
this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. I
hereby banish it completely from my presence. To-
morrow I trust that we shall hear the last of it for
ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sharp at the hour named Inspector Stanley
Hopkins appeared, and we sat down together to
the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had
prepared. The young detective was in high spir-
its at his success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You really think that your solution must be
correct?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not imagine a more complete case.&#8221;
&#8220;It did not seem to me conclusive.&#8221;
&#8220;You astonish me, Mr. Holmes. What more
</p>
<p>could one ask for?&#8221;
&#8220;Does your explanation cover every point?&#8221;
&#8220;Undoubtedly. I find that young Neligan ar-
</p>
<p>rived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of
the crime. He came on the pretence of playing
golf. His room was on the ground-floor, and he
could get out when he liked. That very night he
went down to Woodman&#8217;s Lee, saw Peter Carey
at the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him
with the harpoon. Then, horrified by what he had
done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the note-
book which he had brought with him in order to
question Peter Carey about these different securi-
ties. You may have observed that some of them
were marked with ticks, and the others&#8212;the great
majority&#8212;were not. Those which are ticked have
been traced on the London market; but the others
presumably were still in the possession of Carey,
and young Neligan, according to his own account,
was anxious to recover them in order to do the
right thing by his father&#8217;s creditors. After his flight
he did not dare to approach the hut again for some
time; but at last he forced himself to do so in order
to obtain the information which he needed. Surely
that is all simple and obvious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled and shook his head.
&#8220;It seems to me to have only one drawback,
</p>
<p>Hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impos-
sible. Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a
body? No? Tut, tut, my dear sir, you must really
pay attention to these details. My friend Watson
could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that
exercise. It is no easy matter, and requires a strong
and practised arm. But this blow was delivered
with such violence that the head of the weapon
sank deep into the wall. Do you imagine that this
anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an as-
sault? Is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and
water with Black Peter in the dead of the night?
Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two
nights before? No, no, Hopkins; it is another and a
more formidable person for whom we must seek.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective&#8217;s face had grown longer and
longer during Holmes&#8217;s speech. His hopes and his
ambitions were all crumbling about him. But he
would not abandon his position without a strug-
gle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that Neligan was present that
night, Mr. Holmes. The book will prove that. I
fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a jury,
even if you are able to pick a hole in it. Besides,

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Black Peter
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes, I have laid my hand upon my man.
As to this terrible person of yours, where is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather fancy that he is on the stair,&#8221; said
Holmes, serenely. &#8220;I think, Watson, that you
would do well to put that revolver where you can
reach it.&#8221; He rose, and laid a written paper upon a
side-table. &#8220;Now we are ready,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>There had been some talking in gruff voices
outside, and now Mrs. Hudson opened the door
to say that there were three men inquiring for Cap-
tain Basil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show them in one by one,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>The first who entered was a little ribston-
pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy
white side-whiskers. Holmes had drawn a letter
from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What name?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;James Lancaster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Lancaster, but the berth is full.
Here is half a sovereign for your trouble. Just step
into this room and wait there for a few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second man was a long, dried-up creature,
with lank hair and sallow cheeks. His name was
Hugh Pattins. He also received his dismissal, his
half-sovereign, and the order to wait.
</p>
<p>The third applicant was a man of remarkable
appearance. A fierce bull-dog face was framed
in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold dark
eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted,
overhung eyebrows. He saluted and stood sailor-
fashion, turning his cap round in his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick Cairns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harpooner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dundee, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And ready to start with an exploring ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What wages?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight pounds a month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you start at once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I get my kit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you your papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; He took a sheaf of worn and greasy
forms from his pocket. Holmes glanced over them
and returned them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just the man I want,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
the agreement on the side-table. If you sign it the
whole matter will be settled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The seaman lurched across the room and took
up the pen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I sign here?&#8221; he asked, stooping over the
table.
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed
both hands over his neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This will do,&#8221; said he.
I heard a click of steel and a bellow like an en-
</p>
<p>raged bull. The next instant Holmes and the sea-
man were rolling on the ground together. He was
a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the
handcuffs which Holmes had so deftly fastened
upon his wrists, he would have very quickly over-
powered my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed
to his rescue. Only when I pressed the cold muzzle
of the revolver to his temple did he at last under-
stand that resistance was vain. We lashed his an-
kles with cord and rose breathless from the strug-
gle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must really apologize, Hopkins,&#8221; said Sher-
lock Holmes; &#8220;I fear that the scrambled eggs
are cold. However, you will enjoy the rest of
your breakfast all the better, will you not, for the
thought that you have brought your case to a tri-
umphant conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanley Hopkins was speechless with amaze-
ment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he
blurted out at last, with a very red face. &#8220;It seems
to me that I have been making a fool of myself
from the beginning. I understand now, what I
should never have forgotten, that I am the pupil
and you are the master. Even now I see what you
have done, but I don&#8217;t know how you did it, or
what it signifies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Holmes, good-humouredly.
&#8220;We all learn by experience, and your lesson this
time is that you should never lose sight of the al-
ternative. You were so absorbed in young Neli-
gan that you could not spare a thought to Patrick
Cairns, the true murderer of Peter Carey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our
conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, mister,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I make no com-
plaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but I
would have you call things by their right names.
You say I murdered Peter Carey; I say I killed Peter
Carey, and there&#8217;s all the difference. Maybe you
don&#8217;t believe what I say. Maybe you think I am
just slinging you a yarn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>496</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Let us hear what
you have to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of
it is truth. I knew Black Peter, and when he pulled
out his knife I whipped a harpoon through him
sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. That&#8217;s
how he died. You can call it murder. Anyhow, I&#8217;d
as soon die with a rope round my neck as with
Black Peter&#8217;s knife in my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you there?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell it you from the beginning. Just sit me
up a little so as I can speak easy. It was in &#8217;83
that it happened&#8212;August of that year. Peter Carey
was master of the Sea Unicorn, and I was spare
harpooner. We were coming out of the ice-pack
on our way home, with head winds and a week&#8217;s
southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft
that had been blown north. There was one man
on her&#8212;a landsman. The crew had thought she
would founder, and had made for the Norwegian
coast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned.
Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and
the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All
the baggage we took off with him was one tin box.
So far as I know, the man&#8217;s name was never men-
tioned, and on the second night he disappeared
as if he had never been. It was given out that
he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen
overboard in the heavy weather that we were hav-
ing. Only one man knew what had happened to
him, and that was me, for with my own eyes I saw
the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the
rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days
before we sighted the Shetland lights.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I kept my knowledge to myself and
waited to see what would come of it. When we
got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and
nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by
an accident, and it was nobody&#8217;s business to in-
quire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea,
and it was long years before I could find where he
was. I guessed that he had done the deed for the
sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could
afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth
shut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out where he was through a sailor
man that had met him in London, and down I
went to squeeze him. The first night he was rea-
sonable enough, and was ready to give me what
would make me free of the sea for life. We were
to fix it all two nights later. When I came I found
him three parts drunk and in a vile temper. We
sat down and we drank and we yarned about old
times, but the more he drank the less I liked the
</p>
<p>look on his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the
wall, and I thought I might need it before I was
through. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting
and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great
clasp-knife in his hand. He had not time to get it
from the sheath before I had the harpoon through
him. Heavens! what a yell he gave; and his face
gets between me and my sleep! I stood there, with
his blood splashing round me, and I waited for a
bit; but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I
looked round, and there was the tin box on a shelf.
I had as much right to it as Peter Carey, anyhow,
so I took it with me and left the hut. Like a fool I
left my baccy-pouch upon the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll tell you the queerest part of the whole
story. I had hardly got outside the hut when
I heard someone coming, and I hid among the
bushes. A man came slinking along, went into
the hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and
legged it as hard as he could run until he was out
of sight. Who he was or what he wanted is more
than I can tell. For my part I walked ten miles, got
a train at Tunbridge Wells, and so reached London,
and no one the wiser.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when I came to examine the box I found
there was no money in it, and nothing but papers
that I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold on
Black Peter, and was stranded in London without a
shilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these
advertisements about harpooners and high wages,
so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me
here. That&#8217;s all I know, and I say again that if I
killed Black Peter the law should give me thanks,
for I saved them the price of a hempen rope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very clear statement,&#8221; said Holmes, rising
and lighting his pipe. &#8220;I think, Hopkins, that you
should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to
a place of safety. This room is not well adapted for
a cell, and Mr. Patrick Cairns occupies too large a
proportion of our carpet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said Hopkins, &#8220;I do not know
how to express my gratitude. Even now I do not
understand how you attained this result.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply by having the good fortune to get the
right clue from the beginning. It is very possible
if I had known about this note-book it might have
led away my thoughts, as it did yours. But all I
heard pointed in the one direction. The amazing
strength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the
rum and water, the seal-skin tobacco-pouch, with
the coarse tobacco&#8212;all these pointed to a seaman,
and one who had been a whaler. I was convinced
that the initials &#8216;P.C.&#8217; upon the pouch were a coin-
cidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he sel-
dom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin.
</p>
<p>497</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>You remember that I asked whether whisky and
brandy were in the cabin. You said they were.
How many landsmen are there who would drink
rum when they could get th
