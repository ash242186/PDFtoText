<p>rom the point of view of the crimi-
nal expert,&#8221; said Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
&#8220;London has become a singularly unin-
teresting city since the death of the late
</p>
<p>lamented Professor Moriarty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly think that you would find many
decent citizens to agree with you,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, I must not be selfish,&#8221; said he,
with a smile, as he pushed back his chair from the
breakfast-table. &#8220;The community is certainly the
gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-
work specialist, whose occupation has gone. With
that man in the field one&#8217;s morning paper pre-
sented infinite possibilities. Often it was only the
smallest trace, Watson, the faintest indication, and
yet it was enough to tell me that the great malig-
nant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the
edges of the web remind one of the foul spider
which lurks in the centre. Petty thefts, wanton as-
saults, purposeless outrage&#8212;to the man who held
the clue all could be worked into one connected
whole. To the scientific student of the higher crim-
inal world no capital in Europe offered the advan-
tages which London then possessed. But now&#8212;&#8221;
He shrugged his shoulders in humorous depreca-
tion of the state of things which he had himself
done so much to produce.
</p>
<p>At the time of which I speak Holmes had been
back for some months, and I, at his request, had
sold my practice and returned to share the old
quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named
Verner, had purchased my small Kensington prac-
tice, and given with astonishingly little demur
the highest price that I ventured to ask&#8212;an inci-
dent which only explained itself some years later
when I found that Verner was a distant relation
of Holmes&#8217;s, and that it was my friend who had
really found the money.
</p>
<p>Our months of partnership had not been so un-
eventful as he had stated, for I find, on looking
over my notes, that this period includes the case
of the papers of Ex-President Murillo, and also the
shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland,
which so nearly cost us both our lives. His cold
and proud nature was always averse, however, to
anything in the shape of public applause, and he
bound me in the most stringent terms to say no
further word of himself, his methods, or his suc-
cesses&#8212;a prohibition which, as I have explained,
has only now been removed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his
chair after his whimsical protest, and was unfold-
ing his morning paper in a leisurely fashion, when
our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at
</p>
<p>the bell, followed immediately by a hollow drum-
ming sound, as if someone were beating on the
outer door with his fist. As it opened there came a
tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered
up the stair, and an instant later a wild-eyed and
frantic young man, pale, dishevelled, and palpitat-
ing, burst into the room. He looked from one to
the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he
became conscious that some apology was needed
for this unceremonious entry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t blame me. I am nearly mad. Mr. Holmes,
I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made the announcement as if the name
alone would explain both his visit and its manner;
but I could see by my companion&#8217;s unresponsive
face that it meant no more to him than to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,&#8221; said he,
pushing his case across. &#8220;I am sure that with your
symptoms my friend Dr. Watson here would pre-
scribe a sedative. The weather has been so very
warm these last few days. Now, if you feel a lit-
tle more composed, I should be glad if you would
sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and
quietly who you are and what it is that you want.
You mentioned your name as if I should recognise
it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts
that you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason,
and an asthmatic, I know nothing whatever about
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Familiar as I was with my friend&#8217;s methods, it
was not difficult for me to follow his deductions,
and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of
legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing
which had prompted them. Our client, however,
stared in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes, and in addition
I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in
London. For Heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t abandon me, Mr.
Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I have
finished my story, make them give me time so that
I may tell you the whole truth. I could go to jail
happy if I knew that you were working for me out-
side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrest you!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;This is really most
grati&#8212;most interesting. On what charge do you
expect to be arrested?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas
Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My companion&#8217;s expressive face showed a
sympathy which was not, I am afraid, entirely un-
mixed with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>433</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Norwood Builder
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said he; &#8220;it was only this moment at
breakfast that I was saying to my friend, Dr. Wat-
son, that sensational cases had disappeared out of
our papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand
and picked up the Daily Telegraph, which still lay
upon Holmes&#8217;s knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had looked at it, sir, you would have
seen at a glance what the errand is on which I
have come to you this morning. I feel as if my
name and my misfortune must be in every man&#8217;s
mouth.&#8221; He turned it over to expose the central
page. &#8220;Here it is, and with your permission I will
read it to you. Listen to this, Mr. Holmes. The
head-lines are: &#8216;Mysterious Affair at Lower Nor-
wood. Disappearance of a Well-known Builder.
Suspicion of Murder and Arson. A Clue to the
Criminal.&#8217; That is the clue which they are already
following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that it leads
infallibly to me. I have been followed from Lon-
don Bridge Station, and I am sure that they are
only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. It will
break my mother&#8217;s heart&#8212;it will break her heart!&#8221;
He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension,
and swayed backwards and forwards in his chair.
</p>
<p>I looked with interest upon this man, who was
accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of vi-
olence. He was flaxen-haired and handsome in a
washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue
eyes and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensi-
tive mouth. His age may have been about twenty-
seven; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman.
From the pocket of his light summer overcoat pro-
truded the bundle of endorsed papers which pro-
claimed his profession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must use what time we have,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Watson, would you have the kindness
to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in
question?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Underneath the vigorous head-lines which our
client had quoted I read the following suggestive
narrative:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Late last night, or early this morning, an
incident occurred at Lower Norwood which
points, it is feared, to a serious crime. Mr.
Jonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of
that suburb, where he has carried on his
business as a builder for many years. Mr.
Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of
age, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the
Sydenham end of the road of that name.
He has had the reputation of being a man
of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring.
</p>
<p>For some years he has practically with-
drawn from the business, in which he is
said to have amassed considerable wealth.
A small timber-yard still exists, however,
at the back of the house, and last night,
about twelve o&#8217;clock, an alarm was given
that one of the stacks was on fire. The en-
gines were soon upon the spot, but the dry
wood burned with great fury, and it was
impossible to arrest the conflagration un-
til the stack had been entirely consumed.
Up to this point the incident bore the ap-
pearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh
indications seem to point to serious crime.
Surprise was expressed at the absence of
the master of the establishment from the
scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed,
which showed that he had disappeared from
the house. An examination of his room re-
vealed that the bed had not been slept in,
that a safe which stood in it was open, that a
number of important papers were scattered
about the room, and, finally, that there were
signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces
of blood being found within the room, and
an oaken walking-stick, which also showed
stains of blood upon the handle. It is known
that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late
visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and
the stick found has been identified as the
property of this person, who is a young
London solicitor named John Hector Mc-
Farlane, junior partner of Graham and Mc-
Farlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C.
The police believe that they have evidence
in their possession which supplies a very
convincing motive for the crime, and alto-
gether it cannot be doubted that sensational
developments will follow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Later.&#8212;It is rumoured as we go to press
that Mr. John Hector McFarlane has ac-
tually been arrested on the charge of the
murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. It is at
least certain that a warrant has been issued.
There have been further and sinister devel-
opments in the investigation at Norwood.
Besides the signs of a struggle in the room
of the unfortunate builder it is now known
that the French windows of his bedroom
(which is on the ground floor) were found
to be open, that there were marks as if some
bulky object had been dragged across to the
wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that
charred remains have been found among the
charcoal ashes of the fire. The police theory
</p>
<p>434</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>is that a most sensational crime has been
committed, that the victim was clubbed to
death in his own bedroom, his papers ri-
fled, and his dead body dragged across to
the wood-stack, which was then ignited so
as to hide all traces of the crime. The con-
duct of the criminal investigation has been
left in the experienced hands of Inspector
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is follow-
ing up the clues with his accustomed en-
ergy and sagacity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and
finger-tips together to this remarkable account.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The case has certainly some points of inter-
est,&#8221; said he, in his languid fashion. &#8220;May I ask,
in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how it is that you
are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough
evidence to justify your arrest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with
my parents, Mr. Holmes; but last night, having
to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre,
I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my
business from there. I knew nothing of this affair
until I was in the train, when I read what you have
just heard. I at once saw the horrible danger of my
position, and I hurried to put the case into your
hands. I have no doubt that I should have been
arrested either at my City office or at my home. A
man followed me from London Bridge Station, and
I have no doubt&#8212;Great Heaven, what is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by
heavy steps upon the stair. A moment later our
old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway. Over
his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uni-
formed policemen outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. John Hector McFarlane?&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas
Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of de-
spair, and sank into his chair once more like one
who is crushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment, Lestrade,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Half
an hour more or less can make no difference to
you, and the gentleman was about to give us an
account of this very interesting affair, which might
aid us in clearing it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it
up,&#8221; said Lestrade, grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None the less, with your permission, I should
be much interested to hear his account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to
refuse you anything, for you have been of use to
the force once or twice in the past, and we owe
you a good turn at Scotland Yard,&#8221; said Lestrade.
&#8220;At the same time I must remain with my prisoner,
and I am bound to warn him that anything he may
say will appear in evidence against him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish nothing better,&#8221; said our client. &#8220;All I
ask is that you should hear and recognise the ab-
solute truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade looked at his watch. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you half
an hour,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must explain first,&#8221; said McFarlane, &#8220;that I
knew nothing of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. His name
was familiar to me, for many years ago my par-
ents were acquainted with him, but they drifted
apart. I was very much surprised, therefore, when
yesterday, about three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, he
walked into my office in the City. But I was still
more astonished when he told me the object of his
visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a note-
book, covered with scribbled writing&#8212;here they
are&#8212;and he laid them on my table.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Here is my will,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I want you, Mr.
McFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. I will
sit here while you do so.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine
my astonishment when I found that, with some
reservations, he had left all his property to me.
He was a strange little, ferret-like man, with white
eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his
keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused ex-
pression. I could hardly believe my own senses as
I read the terms of the will; but he explained that
he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation,
that he had known my parents in his youth, and
that he had always heard of me as a very deserv-
ing young man, and was assured that his money
would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only
stammer out my thanks. The will was duly fin-
ished, signed, and witnessed by my clerk. This
is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I have
explained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre
then informed me that there were a number of doc-
uments&#8212;building leases, title-deeds, mortgages,
scrip, and so forth&#8212;which it was necessary that I
should see and understand. He said that his mind
would not be easy until the whole thing was set-
tled, and he begged me to come out to his house
at Norwood that night, bringing the will with me,
and to arrange matters. &#8216;Remember, my boy, not
one word to your parents about the affair until ev-
erything is settled. We will keep it as a little sur-
prise for them.&#8217; He was very insistent upon this
point, and made me promise it faithfully.
</p>
<p>435</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Norwood Builder
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not
in a humour to refuse him anything that he might
ask. He was my benefactor, and all my desire was
to carry out his wishes in every particular. I sent a
telegram home, therefore, to say that I had impor-
tant business on hand, and that it was impossible
for me to say how late I might be. Mr. Oldacre
had told me that he would like me to have supper
with him at nine, as he might not be home be-
fore that hour. I had some difficulty in finding his
house, however, and it was nearly half-past before
I reached it. I found him&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Who opened
the door?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose,
his housekeeper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it was she, I presume, who mentioned
your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said McFarlane.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray proceed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>McFarlane wiped his damp brow and then con-
tinued his narrative:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shown by this woman into a sitting-
room, where a frugal supper was laid out. Af-
terwards Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into his bed-
room, in which there stood a heavy safe. This he
opened and took out a mass of documents, which
we went over together. It was between eleven and
twelve when we finished. He remarked that we
must not disturb the housekeeper. He showed me
out through his own French window, which had
been open all this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the blind down?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only
half down. Yes, I remember how he pulled it up
in order to swing open the window. I could not
find my stick, and he said, &#8216;Never mind, my boy;
I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I
will keep your stick until you come back to claim
it.&#8217; I left him there, the safe open, and the papers
made up in packets upon the table. It was so late
that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I spent
the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew noth-
ing more until I read of this horrible affair in the
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything more that you would like to ask,
Mr. Holmes?&#8221; said Lestrade, whose eyebrows had
gone up once or twice during this remarkable ex-
planation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until I have been to Blackheath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to Norwood,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have
meant,&#8221; said Holmes, with his enigmatical smile.
Lestrade had learned by more experiences than
he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like
brain could cut through that which was impenetra-
ble to him. I saw him look curiously at my com-
panion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I should like to have a word with you
presently, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now,
Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at the
door and there is a four-wheeler waiting.&#8221; The
wretched young man arose, and with a last be-
seeching glance at us walked from the room. The
officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade re-
mained.
</p>
<p>Holmes had picked up the pages which formed
the rough draft of the will, and was looking at
them with the keenest interest upon his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some points about that document,
Lestrade, are there not?&#8221; said he, pushing them
over.
</p>
<p>The official looked at them with a puzzled ex-
pression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can read the first few lines, and these in the
middle of the second page, and one or two at the
end. Those are as clear as print,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but the
writing in between is very bad, and there are three
places where I cannot read it at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that?&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221;
&#8220;That it was written in a train; the good writ-
</p>
<p>ing represents stations, the bad writing movement,
and the very bad writing passing over points. A
scientific expert would pronounce at once that this
was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere
save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could
there be so quick a succession of points. Grant-
ing that his whole journey was occupied in draw-
ing up the will, then the train was an express,
only stopping once between Norwood and Lon-
don Bridge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade began to laugh.
&#8220;You are too many for me when you begin to
</p>
<p>get on your theories, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;How
does this bear on the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it corroborates the young man&#8217;s story to
the extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas
Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is curious&#8212;is
it not?&#8212;that a man should draw up so important
a document in so haphazard a fashion. It sug-
gests that he did not think it was going to be of
much practical importance. If a man drew up a
will which he did not intend ever to be effective he
might do it so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>436</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, he drew up his own death-warrant at the
same time,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is quite possible; but the case is not
clear to me yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not clear? Well, if that isn&#8217;t clear, what could
be clear? Here is a young man who learns sud-
denly that if a certain older man dies he will suc-
ceed to a fortune. What does he do? He says
nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall
go out on some pretext to see his client that night;
he waits until the only other person in the house
is in bed, and then in the solitude of a man&#8217;s room
he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile,
and departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-
stains in the room and also on the stick are very
slight. It is probable that he imagined his crime
to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body
were consumed it would hide all traces of the
method of his death&#8212;traces which for some rea-
son must have pointed to him. Is all this not obvi-
ous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just
a trifle too obvious,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You do not
add imagination to your other great qualities; but
if you could for one moment put yourself in the
place of this young man, would you choose the
very night after the will had been made to commit
your crime? Would it not seem dangerous to you
to make so very close a relation between the two
incidents? Again, would you choose an occasion
when you are known to be in the house, when a
servant has let you in? And, finally, would you
take the great pains to conceal the body and yet
leave your own stick as a sign that you were the
criminal? Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very
unlikely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well
as I do that a criminal is often flurried and does
things which a cool man would avoid. He was
very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me
another theory that would fit the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could very easily give you half-a-dozen,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Here, for example, is a very pos-
sible and even probable one. I make you a free
present of it. The older man is showing documents
which are of evident value. A passing tramp sees
them through the window, the blind of which is
only half down. Exit the solicitor. Enter the tramp!
He seizes a stick, which he observes there, kills
Oldacre, and departs after burning the body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the tramp burn the body?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the matter of that why should McFar-
lane?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To hide some evidence.&#8221;
&#8220;Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any
</p>
<p>murder at all had been committed.&#8221;
&#8220;And why did the tramp take nothing?&#8221;
&#8220;Because they were papers that he could not
</p>
<p>negotiate.&#8221;
Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to
</p>
<p>me that his manner was less absolutely assured
than before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for
your tramp, and while you are finding him we will
hold on to our man. The future will show which
is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so
far as we know none of the papers were removed,
and that the prisoner is the one man in the world
who had no reason for removing them, since he
was heir-at-law and would come into them in any
case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend seemed struck by this remark.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to deny that the evidence is in
</p>
<p>some ways very strongly in favour of your the-
ory,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I only wish to point out that there
are other theories possible. As you say, the future
will decide. Good morning! I dare say that in the
course of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and
see how you are getting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the detective departed my friend rose
and made his preparations for the day&#8217;s work with
the alert air of a man who has a congenial task be-
fore him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My first movement, Watson,&#8221; said he, as he
bustled into his frock-coat, &#8220;must, as I said, be in
the direction of Blackheath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not Norwood?&#8221;
&#8220;Because we have in this case one singular in-
</p>
<p>cident coming close to the heels of another singu-
lar incident. The police are making the mistake
of concentrating their attention upon the second,
because it happens to be the one which is actu-
ally criminal. But it is evident to me that the logi-
cal way to approach the case is to begin by trying
to throw some light upon the first incident&#8212;the
curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unex-
pected an heir. It may do something to simplify
what followed. No, my dear fellow, I don&#8217;t think
you can help me. There is no prospect of dan-
ger, or I should not dream of stirring out without
you. I trust that when I see you in the evening I
will be able to report that I have been able to do
something for this unfortunate youngster who has
thrown himself upon my protection.&#8221;

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Norwood Builder
</p>
<p>It was late when my friend returned, and I
could see by a glance at his haggard and anxious
face that the high hopes with which he had started
had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away
upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own
ruffled spirits. At last he flung down the instru-
ment and plunged into a detailed account of his
misadventures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all going wrong, Watson&#8212;all as wrong as
it can go. I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but,
upon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is
on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my
instincts are one way and all the facts are the other,
and I much fear that British juries have not yet
attained that pitch of intelligence when they will
give the preference to my theories over Lestrade&#8217;s
facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you go to Blackheath?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very
quickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty
considerable black-guard. The father was away in
search of his son. The mother was at home&#8212;a
little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear
and indignation. Of course, she would not admit
even the possibility of his guilt. But she would not
express either surprise or regret over the fate of
Oldacre. On the contrary, she spoke of him with
such bitterness that she was unconsciously consid-
erably strengthening the case of the police, for, of
course, if her son had heard her speak of the man
in this fashion it would predispose him towards
hatred and violence. &#8216;He was more like a malig-
nant and cunning ape than a human being,&#8217; said
she, &#8216;and he always was, ever since he was a young
man.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You knew him at that time?&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old
suitor of mine. Thank Heaven that I had the sense
to turn away from him and to marry a better, if a
poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes,
when I heard a shocking story of how he had
turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was so horri-
fied at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing
more to do with him.&#8217; She rummaged in a bu-
reau, and presently she produced a photograph of
a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with
a knife. &#8216;That is my own photograph,&#8217; she said.
&#8216;He sent it to me in that state, with his curse, upon
my wedding morning.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, &#8216;at least he has forgiven you
now, since he has left all his property to your son.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Neither my son nor I want anything from
Jonas Oldacre, dead or alive,&#8217; she cried, with a
</p>
<p>proper spirit. &#8216;There is a God in Heaven, Mr.
Holmes, and that same God who has punished
that wicked man will show in His own good time
that my son&#8217;s hands are guiltless of his blood.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get
at nothing which would help our hypothesis, and
several points which would make against it. I gave
it up at last and off I went to Norwood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This place, Deep Dene House, is a big mod-
ern villa of staring brick, standing back in its own
grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front of it.
To the right and some distance back from the road
was the timber-yard which had been the scene of
the fire. Here&#8217;s a rough plan on a leaf of my
note-book. This window on the left is the one
which opens into Oldacre&#8217;s room. You can look
into it from the road, you see. That is about the
only bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade
was not there, but his head constable did the hon-
ours. They had just made a great treasure-trove.
They had spent the morning raking among the
ashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the
charred organic remains they had secured sev-
eral discoloured metal discs. I examined them
with care, and there was no doubt that they were
trouser buttons. I even distinguished that one of
them was marked with the name of &#8216;Hyams,&#8217; who
was Oldacre&#8217;s tailor. I then worked the lawn very
carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has
made everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to
be seen save that some body or bundle had been
dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a
line with the wood-pile. All that, of course, fits in
with the official theory. I crawled about the lawn
with an August sun on my back, but I got up at
the end of an hour no wiser than before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom
and examined that also. The blood-stains were
very slight, mere smears and discolorations, but
undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed,
but there also the marks were slight. There is no
doubt about the stick belonging to our client. He
admits it. Footmarks of both men could be made
out on the carpet, but none of any third person,
which again is a trick for the other side. They were
piling up their score all the time and we were at a
standstill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one little gleam of hope did I get&#8212;and
yet it amounted to nothing. I examined the con-
tents of the safe, most of which had been taken out
and left on the table. The papers had been made
up into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had
been opened by the police. They were not, so far
as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the
</p>
<p>438</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very
affluent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all
the papers were not there. There were allusions to
some deeds&#8212;possibly the more valuable&#8212;which
I could not find. This, of course, if we could def-
initely prove it, would turn Lestrade&#8217;s argument
against himself, for who would steal a thing if he
knew that he would shortly inherit it?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, having drawn every other cover and
picked up no scent, I tried my luck with the house-
keeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name, a little, dark,
silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes.
She could tell us something if she would&#8212;I am
convinced of it. But she was as close as wax.
Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane in at half-past nine.
She wished her hand had withered before she had
done so. She had gone to bed at half-past ten. Her
room was at the other end of the house, and she
could hear nothing of what passed. Mr. McFar-
lane had left his hat, and to the best of her belief
his stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by
the alarm of fire. Her poor, dear master had cer-
tainly been murdered. Had he any enemies? Well,
every man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre kept him-
self very much to himself, and only met people in
the way of business. She had seen the buttons, and
was sure that they belonged to the clothes which
he had worn last night. The wood-pile was very
dry, for it had not rained for a month. It burned
like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot
nothing could be seen but flames. She and all
the firemen smelled the burned flesh from inside
it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr.
Oldacre&#8217;s private affairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, my dear Watson, there&#8217;s my report of a
failure. And yet&#8212;and yet&#8212;&#8221;&#8212;he clenched his
thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction&#8212;&#8220;I know
it&#8217;s all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There is some-
thing that has not come out, and that housekeeper
knows it. There was a sort of sulky defiance in
her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge.
However, there&#8217;s no good talking any more about
it, Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes
our way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance
Case will not figure in that chronicle of our suc-
cesses which I foresee that a patient public will
sooner or later have to endure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the man&#8217;s appearance would
go far with any jury?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a dangerous argument, my dear Wat-
son. You remember that terrible murderer, Bert
Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in &#8217;87? Was
there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school
young man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true.&#8221;
&#8220;Unless we succeed in establishing an alter-
</p>
<p>native theory this man is lost. You can hardly
find a flaw in the case which can now be pre-
sented against him, and all further investigation
has served to strengthen it. By the way, there is
one curious little point about those papers which
may serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry.
On looking over the bank-book I found that the
low state of the balance was principally due to
large cheques which have been made out during
the last year to Mr. Cornelius. I confess that I
should be interested to know who this Mr. Cor-
nelius may be with whom a retired builder has
such very large transactions. Is it possible that he
has had a hand in the affair? Cornelius might be a
broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond
with these large payments. Failing any other indi-
cation my researches must now take the direction
of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who
has cashed these cheques. But I fear, my dear fel-
low, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade
hanging our client, which will certainly be a tri-
umph for Scotland Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took
any sleep that night, but when I came down to
breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright
eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round
them. The carpet round his chair was littered with
cigarette-ends and with the early editions of the
morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the
table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of this, Watson?&#8221; he asked,
tossing it across.
</p>
<p>It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Important fresh evidence to hand.
McFarlane&#8217;s guilt definitely estab-
lished. Advise you to abandon case.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This sounds serious,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;It is Lestrade&#8217;s little cock-a-doodle of victory,&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes answered, with a bitter smile. &#8220;And yet
it may be premature to abandon the case. After
all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing,
and may possibly cut in a very different direction
to that which Lestrade imagines. Take your break-
fast, Watson, and we will go out together and see
what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your com-
pany and your moral support to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was
one of his peculiarities that in his more intense mo-
ments he would permit himself no food, and I have
known him presume upon his iron strength until
</p>
<p>439</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Norwood Builder
</p>
<p>he has fainted from pure inanition. &#8220;At present
I cannot spare energy and nerve force for diges-
tion,&#8221; he would say in answer to my medical re-
monstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when
this morning he left his untouched meal behind
him and started with me for Norwood. A crowd
of morbid sightseers were still gathered round
Deep Dene House, which was just such a suburban
villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade
met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner
grossly triumphant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be
wrong yet? Have you found your tramp?&#8221; he
cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have formed no conclusion whatever,&#8221; my
companion answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we formed ours yesterday, and now it
proves to be correct; so you must acknowledge that
we have been a little in front of you this time, Mr.
Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have the air of something un-
usual having occurred,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>Lestrade laughed loudly.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like being beaten any more than the
</p>
<p>rest of us do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A man can&#8217;t expect always
to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson? Step
this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I
can convince you once for all that it was John Mc-
Farlane who did this crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led us through the passage and out into a
dark hall beyond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where young McFarlane must have
come out to get his hat after the crime was done,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Now, look at this.&#8221; With dramatic sud-
denness he struck a match and by its light exposed
a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he
held the match nearer I saw that it was more than
a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr.
Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am doing so.&#8221;
&#8220;You are aware that no two thumb marks are
</p>
<p>alike?&#8221;
&#8220;I have heard something of the kind.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, will you please compare that print
</p>
<p>with this wax impression of young McFarlane&#8217;s
right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he held the waxen print close to the blood-
stain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that
the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb.
It was evident to me that our unfortunate client
was lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is final,&#8221; said Lestrade.
&#8220;Yes, that is final,&#8221; I involuntarily echoed.
&#8220;It is final,&#8221; said Holmes.
Something in his tone caught my ear, and I
</p>
<p>turned to look at him. An extraordinary change
had come over his face. It was writhing with in-
ward merriment. His two eyes were shining like
stars. It seemed to me that he was making desper-
ate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laugh-
ter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! Dear me!&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Well,
now, who would have thought it? And how de-
ceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a
nice young man to look at! It is a lesson to us not
to trust our own judgment, is it not, Lestrade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined
to be cocksure, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said Lestrade. The
man&#8217;s insolence was maddening, but we could not
resent it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a providential thing that this young man
should press his right thumb against the wall in
taking his hat from the peg! Such a very natural
action, too, if you come to think of it.&#8221; Holmes was
outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wrig-
gle of suppressed excitement as he spoke. &#8220;By the
way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discov-
ery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who
drew the night constable&#8217;s attention to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was the night constable?&#8221;
&#8220;He remained on guard in the bedroom where
</p>
<p>the crime was committed, so as to see that nothing
was touched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t the police see this mark yes-
terday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we had no particular reason to make a
careful examination of the hall. Besides, it&#8217;s not in
a very prominent place, as you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no
doubt that the mark was there yesterday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he
was going out of his mind. I confess that I was
myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and
at his rather wild observation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you think that McFar-
lane came out of jail in the dead of the night in
order to strengthen the evidence against himself,&#8221;
said Lestrade. &#8220;I leave it to any expert in the world
whether that is not the mark of his thumb.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.&#8221;
&#8220;There, that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said Lestrade. &#8220;I am
</p>
<p>a practical man, Mr. Holmes, and when I have got
</p>
<p>440</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>my evidence I come to my conclusions. If you have
anything to say you will find me writing my report
in the sitting-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though
I still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, this is a very sad development, Wat-
son, is it not?&#8221; said he. &#8220;And yet there are singular
points about it which hold out some hopes for our
client.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted to hear it,&#8221; said I, heartily. &#8220;I
was afraid it was all up with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would hardly go so far as to say that, my
dear Watson. The fact is that there is one really
serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend
attaches so much importance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Holmes! What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only this: that I know that that mark was not
there when I examined the hall yesterday. And
now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in the
sunshine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a confused brain, but with a heart into
which some warmth of hope was returning, I ac-
companied my friend in a walk round the garden.
Holmes took each face of the house in turn and
examined it with great interest. He then led the
way inside and went over the whole building from
basement to attics. Most of the rooms were unfur-
nished, but none the less Holmes inspected them
all minutely. Finally, on the top corridor, which
ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again
was seized with a spasm of merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are really some very unique features
about this case, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I think it is
time now that we took our friend Lestrade into
our confidence. He has had his little smile at our
expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him
if my reading of this problem proves to be correct.
Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in
the parlour when Holmes interrupted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood that you were writing a report of
this case,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it may be a little premature? I
can&#8217;t help thinking that your evidence is not com-
plete.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard
his words. He laid down his pen and looked curi-
ously at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that there is an important witness whom
you have not seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you produce him?&#8221;
&#8220;I think I can.&#8221;
&#8220;Then do so.&#8221;
&#8220;I will do my best. How many constables have
</p>
<p>you?&#8221;
&#8220;There are three within call.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;May I ask if they
</p>
<p>are all large, able-bodied men with powerful
voices?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see
what their voices have to do with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or
two other things as well,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Kindly
summon your men, and I will try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five minutes later three policemen had assem-
bled in the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the outhouse you will find a considerable
quantity of straw,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I will ask you to
carry in two bundles of it. I think it will be of the
greatest assistance in producing the witness whom
I require. Thank you very much. I believe you have
some matches in your pocket, Watson. Now, Mr.
Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the
top landing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As I have said, there was a broad corridor there,
which ran outside three empty bedrooms. At one
end of the corridor we were all marshalled by Sher-
lock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade
staring at my friend with amazement, expectation,
and derision chasing each other across his features.
Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer
who is performing a trick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you kindly send one of your consta-
bles for two buckets of water? Put the straw on
the floor here, free from the wall on either side.
Now I think that we are all ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade&#8217;s face had begun to grow red and an-
gry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you are playing a game
with us, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If you
know anything, you can surely say it without all
this tomfoolery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have
an excellent reason for everything that I do. You
may possibly remember that you chaffed me a lit-
tle some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your
side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a
little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask you,
Watson, to open that window, and then to put a
match to the edge of the straw?&#8221;
</p>
<p>441</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Norwood Builder
</p>
<p>I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of
grey smoke swirled down the corridor, while the
dry straw crackled and flamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must see if we can find this witness
for you, Lestrade. Might I ask you all to join in the
cry of &#8216;Fire!&#8217;? Now, then; one, two, three&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; we all yelled.
&#8220;Thank you. I will trouble you once again.&#8221;
&#8220;Fire!&#8221;
&#8220;Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.&#8221;
&#8220;Fire!&#8221; The shout must have rung over Nor-
</p>
<p>wood.
It had hardly died away when an amazing
</p>
<p>thing happened. A door suddenly flew open out
of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the
corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of
it, like a rabbit out of its burrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; said Holmes, calmly. &#8220;Watson, a
bucket of water over the straw. That will do!
Lestrade, allow me to present you with your prin-
cipal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective stared at the new-comer with
blank amazement. The latter was blinking in the
bright light of the corridor, and peering at us
and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious
face&#8212;crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-
grey eyes and white eyelashes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, then?&#8221; said Lestrade at last.
&#8220;What have you been doing all this time, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back
from the furious red face of the angry detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done no harm.&#8221;
&#8220;No harm? You have done your best to get an
</p>
<p>innocent man hanged. If it wasn&#8217;t for this gentle-
man here, I am not sure that you would not have
succeeded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wretched creature began to whimper.
&#8220;I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh! a joke, was it? You won&#8217;t find the laugh
</p>
<p>on your side, I promise you. Take him down and
keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; he continued, when they had gone, &#8220;I
could not speak before the constables, but I don&#8217;t
mind saying, in the presence of Dr. Watson, that
this is the brightest thing that you have done yet,
though it is a mystery to me how you did it. You
have saved an innocent man&#8217;s life, and you have
prevented a very grave scandal, which would have
ruined my reputation in the Force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will
find that your reputation has been enormously en-
hanced. Just make a few alterations in that report
which you were writing, and they will understand
how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspec-
tor Lestrade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t want your name to appear?&#8221;
&#8220;Not at all. The work is its own reward. Per-
</p>
<p>haps I shall get the credit also at some distant day
when I permit my zealous historian to lay out his
foolscap once more&#8212;eh, Watson? Well, now, let us
see where this rat has been lurking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A lath-and-plaster partition had been run
across the passage six feet from the end, with a
door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within
by slits under the eaves. A few articles of furni-
ture and a supply of food and water were within,
together with a number of books and papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the advantage of being a builder,&#8221; said
Holmes, as we came out. &#8220;He was able to fix up
his own little hiding-place without any confeder-
ate&#8212;save, of course, that precious housekeeper of
his, whom I should lose no time in adding to your
bag, Lestrade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your advice. But how did you know
of this place, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made up my mind that the fellow was in
hiding in the house. When I paced one corridor
and found it six feet shorter than the correspond-
ing one below, it was pretty clear where he was.
I thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before
an alarm of fire. We could, of course, have gone
in and taken him, but it amused me to make him
reveal himself; besides, I owed you a little mystifi-
cation, Lestrade, for your chaff in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on
that. But how in the world did you know that he
was in the house at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was fi-
nal; and so it was, in a very different sense. I knew
it had not been there the day before. I pay a good
deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may
have observed, and I had examined the hall and
was sure that the wall was clear. Therefore, it had
been put on during the night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;
&#8220;Very simply. When those packets were sealed
</p>
<p>up, Jonas Oldacre got McFarlane to secure one of
the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax.
It would be done so quickly and so naturally that
I dare say the young man himself has no recol-
lection of it. Very likely it just so happened, and
Oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would
put it to. Brooding over the case in that den of his,
</p>
<p>442</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning
evidence he could make against McFarlane by us-
ing that thumb-mark. It was the simplest thing in
the world for him to take a wax impression from
the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as he could
get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the
wall during the night, either with his own hand
or with that of his housekeeper. If you examine
among those documents which he took with him
into his retreat I will lay you a wager that you find
the seal with the thumb-mark upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; said Lestrade. &#8220;Wonderful! It&#8217;s
all as clear as crystal, as you put it. But what is the
object of this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was amusing to me to see how the detective&#8217;s
overbearing manner had changed suddenly to that
of a child asking questions of its teacher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think that is very hard to ex-
plain. A very deep, malicious, vindictive person
is the gentleman who is now awaiting us down-
stairs. You know that he was once refused by
McFarlane&#8217;s mother? You don&#8217;t! I told you that
you should go to Blackheath first and Norwood
afterwards. Well, this injury, as he would con-
sider it, has rankled in his wicked, scheming brain,
and all his life he has longed for vengeance, but
never seen his chance. During the last year or two
things have gone against him&#8212;secret speculation,
I think&#8212;and he finds himself in a bad way. He de-
termines to swindle his creditors, and for this pur-
pose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr. Cor-
nelius, who is, I imagine, himself under another
name. I have not traced these cheques yet, but I
have no doubt that they were banked under that
name at some provincial town where Oldacre from
time to time led a double existence. He intended
to change his name altogether, draw this money,
and vanish, starting life again elsewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s likely enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would strike him that in disappearing he
might throw all pursuit off his track, and at the
same time have an ample and crushing revenge
upon his old sweetheart, if he could give the im-
pression that he had been murdered by her only
</p>
<p>child. It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he car-
ried it out like a master. The idea of the will, which
would give an obvious motive for the crime, the
secret visit unknown to his own parents, the re-
tention of the stick, the blood, and the animal re-
mains and buttons in the wood-pile, all were ad-
mirable. It was a net from which it seemed to
me a few hours ago that there was no possible es-
cape. But he had not that supreme gift of the artist,
the knowledge of when to stop. He wished to
improve that which was already perfect&#8212;to draw
the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortu-
nate victim&#8212;and so he ruined all. Let us descend,
Lestrade. There are just one or two questions that
I would ask him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The malignant creature was seated in his own
parlour with a policeman upon each side of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a joke, my good sir, a practical joke,
nothing more,&#8221; he whined incessantly. &#8220;I assure
you, sir, that I simply concealed myself in order
to see the effect of my disappearance, and I am
sure that you
