<p>rom the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive Mr.
Sherlock Holmes was a very busy man.
It is safe to say that there was no pub-
lic case of any difficulty in which he was
</p>
<p>not consulted during those eight years, and there
were hundreds of private cases, some of them of
the most intricate and extraordinary character, in
which he played a prominent part. Many startling
successes and a few unavoidable failures were the
outcome of this long period of continuous work.
As I have preserved very full notes of all these
cases, and was myself personally engaged in many
of them, it may be imagined that it is no easy task
to know which I should select to lay before the
public. I shall, however, preserve my former rule,
and give the preference to those cases which derive
their interest not so much from the brutality of the
crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality
of the solution. For this reason I will now lay be-
fore the reader the facts connected with Miss Vi-
olet Smith, the solitary cyclist of Charlington, and
the curious sequel of our investigation, which cul-
minated in unexpected tragedy. It is true that the
circumstances did not admit of any striking illus-
tration of those powers for which my friend was
famous, but there were some points about the case
which made it stand out in those long records of
crime from which I gather the material for these
little narratives.
</p>
<p>On referring to my note-book for the year 1895
I find that it was upon Saturday, the 23rd of April,
that we first heard of Miss Violet Smith. Her
visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to
Holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a
very abstruse and complicated problem concern-
ing the peculiar persecution to which John Vin-
cent Harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire,
had been subjected. My friend, who loved above
all things precision and concentration of thought,
resented anything which distracted his attention
from the matter in hand. And yet without a harsh-
ness which was foreign to his nature it was impos-
sible to refuse to listen to the story of the young
and beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly,
who presented herself at Baker Street late in the
evening and implored his assistance and advice. It
was vain to urge that his time was already fully
occupied, for the young lady had come with the
determination to tell her story, and it was evident
that nothing short of force could get her out of the
room until she had done so. With a resigned air
and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the
beautiful intruder to take a seat and to inform us
what it was that was troubling her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least it cannot be your health,&#8221; said he, as
</p>
<p>his keen eyes darted over her; &#8220;so ardent a bicyclist
must be full of energy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced down in surprise at her own feet,
and I observed the slight roughening of the side of
the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the
pedal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and
that has something to do with my visit to you to-
day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend took the lady&#8217;s ungloved hand and
examined it with as close an attention and as little
sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me, I am sure. It is my busi-
ness,&#8221; said he, as he dropped it. &#8220;I nearly fell into
the error of supposing that you were typewriting.
Of course, it is obvious that it is music. You ob-
serve the spatulate finger-end, Watson, which is
common to both professions? There is a spiritual-
ity about the face, however&#8221;&#8212;he gently turned it
towards the light&#8212;&#8220;which the typewriter does not
generate. This lady is a musician.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music.&#8221;
&#8220;In the country, I presume, from your complex-
</p>
<p>ion.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; near Farnham, on the borders of Sur-
</p>
<p>rey.&#8221;
&#8220;A beautiful neighbourhood and full of the
</p>
<p>most interesting associations. You remember, Wat-
son, that it was near there that we took Archie
Stamford, the forger. Now, Miss Violet, what has
happened to you near Farnham, on the borders of
Surrey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young lady, with great clearness and com-
posure, made the following curious statement:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James
Smith, who conducted the orchestra at the old Im-
perial Theatre. My mother and I were left with-
out a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph
Smith, who went to Africa twenty-five years ago,
and we have never had a word from him since.
When father died we were left very poor, but one
day we were told that there was an advertisement
in the Times inquiring for our whereabouts. You
can imagine how excited we were, for we thought
that someone had left us a fortune. We went at
once to the lawyer whose name was given in the
paper. There we met two gentlemen, Mr. Car-
ruthers and Mr. Woodley, who were home on a
visit from South Africa. They said that my uncle
was a friend of theirs, that he died some months
before in great poverty in Johannesburg, and that
he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up
his relations and see that they were in no want. It
seemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took
</p>
<p>461</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist
</p>
<p>no notice of us when he was alive, should be so
careful to look after us when he was dead; but Mr.
Carruthers explained that the reason was that my
uncle had just heard of the death of his brother,
and so felt responsible for our fate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Holmes; &#8220;when was this in-
terview?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last December&#8212;four months ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray proceed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odi-
ous person. He was for ever making eyes at me&#8212;a
coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man,
with his hair plastered down on each side of his
forehead. I thought that he was perfectly hate-
ful&#8212;and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me
to know such a person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cyril is his name!&#8221; said Holmes, smiling.
</p>
<p>The young lady blushed and laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical
engineer, and we hope to be married at the end of
the summer. Dear me, how did I get talking about
him? What I wished to say was that Mr. Wood-
ley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers,
who was a much older man, was more agreeable.
He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent per-
son; but he had polite manners and a pleasant
smile. He inquired how we were left, and on find-
ing that we were very poor he suggested that I
should come and teach music to his only daugh-
ter, aged ten. I said that I did not like to leave my
mother, on which he suggested that I should go
home to her every week-end, and he offered me a
hundred a year, which was certainly splendid pay.
So it ended by my accepting, and I went down
to Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farn-
ham. Mr. Carruthers was a widower, but he had
engaged a lady-housekeeper, a very respectable,
elderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after
his establishment. The child was a dear, and ev-
erything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very
kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant
evenings together. Every week-end I went home to
my mother in town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival
of the red-moustached Mr. Woodley. He came for
a visit of a week, and oh, it seemed three months
to me! He was a dreadful person, a bully to ev-
eryone else, but to me something infinitely worse.
He made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth,
said that if I married him I would have the finest
diamonds in London, and finally, when I would
have nothing to do with him, he seized me in
his arms one day after dinner&#8212;he was hideously
</p>
<p>strong&#8212;and he swore that he would not let me
go until I had kissed him. Mr. Carruthers came
in and tore him off from me, on which he turned
upon his own host, knocking him down and cut-
ting his face open. That was the end of his visit,
as you can imagine. Mr. Carruthers apologized to
me next day, and assured me that I should never
be exposed to such an insult again. I have not seen
Mr. Woodley since.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the
special thing which has caused me to ask your ad-
vice to-day. You must know that every Saturday
forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station
in order to get the 12.22 to town. The road from
Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it
is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between
Charlington Heath upon one side and the woods
which lie round Charlington Hall upon the other.
You could not find a more lonely tract of road any-
where, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a
cart, or a peasant, until you reach the high road
near Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks ago I was pass-
ing this place when I chanced to look back over
my shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind
me I saw a man, also on a bicycle. He seemed to
be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard.
I looked back before I reached Farnham, but the
man was gone, so I thought no more about it. But
you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes,
when on my return on the Monday I saw the same
man on the same stretch of road. My astonish-
ment was increased when the incident occurred
again, exactly as before, on the following Saturday
and Monday. He always kept his distance and did
not molest me in any way, but still it certainly was
very odd. I mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers, who
seemed interested in what I said, and told me that
he had ordered a horse and trap, so that in future
I should not pass over these lonely roads without
some companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The horse and trap were to have come this
week, but for some reason they were not deliv-
ered, and again I had to cycle to the station. That
was this morning. You can think that I looked out
when I came to Charlington Heath, and there, sure
enough, was the man, exactly as he had been the
two weeks before. He always kept so far from me
that I could not clearly see his face, but it was cer-
tainly someone whom I did not know. He was
dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. The only
thing about his face that I could clearly see was
his dark beard. To-day I was not alarmed, but I
was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find
out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed
down my machine, but he slowed down his. Then
</p>
<p>462</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then I
laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of
the road, and I pedalled very quickly round this,
and then I stopped and waited. I expected him to
shoot round and pass me before he could stop. But
he never appeared. Then I went back and looked
round the corner. I could see a mile of road, but he
was not on it. To make it the more extraordinary,
there was no side road at this point down which
he could have gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. &#8220;This
case certainly presents some features of its own,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;How much time elapsed between your
turning the corner and your discovery that the
road was clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two or three minutes.&#8221;
&#8220;Then he could not have retreated down the
</p>
<p>road, and you say that there are no side roads?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;Then he certainly took a footpath on one side
</p>
<p>or the other.&#8221;
&#8220;It could not have been on the side of the heath
</p>
<p>or I should have seen him.&#8221;
&#8220;So by the process of exclusion we arrive at
</p>
<p>the fact that he made his way towards Charling-
ton Hall, which, as I understand, is situated in its
own grounds on one side of the road. Anything
else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so per-
plexed that I felt I should not be happy until I had
seen you and had your advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat in silence for some little time.
&#8220;Where is the gentleman to whom you are en-
</p>
<p>gaged?&#8221; he asked, at last.
&#8220;He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at
</p>
<p>Coventry.&#8221;
&#8220;He would not pay you a surprise visit?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know
</p>
<p>him!&#8221;
&#8220;Have you had any other admirers?&#8221;
&#8220;Several before I knew Cyril.&#8221;
&#8220;And since?&#8221;
&#8220;There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you
</p>
<p>can call him an admirer.&#8221;
&#8220;No one else?&#8221;
Our fair client seemed a little confused.
&#8220;Who was he?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has
</p>
<p>seemed to me sometimes that my employer, Mr.
Carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me.
</p>
<p>We are thrown rather together. I play his accom-
paniments in the evening. He has never said any-
thing. He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always
knows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; Holmes looked grave. &#8220;What does he do
for a living?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a rich man.&#8221;
&#8220;No carriages or horses?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he
</p>
<p>goes into the City two or three times a week. He is
deeply interested in South African gold shares.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will let me know any fresh development,
Miss Smith. I am very busy just now, but I will find
time to make some inquiries into your case. In the
meantime take no step without letting me know.
Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have nothing
but good news from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is part of the settled order of Nature that
such a girl should have followers,&#8221; said Holmes,
as he pulled at his meditative pipe, &#8220;but for choice
not on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some se-
cretive lover, beyond all doubt. But there are cu-
rious and suggestive details about the case, Wat-
son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he should appear only at that point?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly. Our first effort must be to find who
</p>
<p>are the tenants of Charlington Hall. Then, again,
how about the connection between Carruthers and
Woodley, since they appear to be men of such a
different type? How came they both to be so keen
upon looking up Ralph Smith&#8217;s relations? One
more point. What sort of a menage is it which pays
double the market price for a governess, but does
not keep a horse although six miles from the sta-
tion? Odd, Watson&#8212;very odd!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go down?&#8221;
&#8220;No, my dear fellow, you will go down. This
</p>
<p>may be some trifling intrigue, and I cannot break
my other important research for the sake of it. On
Monday you will arrive early at Farnham; you will
conceal yourself near Charlington Heath; you will
observe these facts for yourself, and act as your
own judgment advises. Then, having inquired
as to the occupants of the Hall, you will come
back to me and report. And now, Watson, not
another word of the matter until we have a few
solid stepping-stones on which we may hope to
get across to our solution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had ascertained from the lady that she went
down upon the Monday by the train which leaves
Waterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught the
9.13. At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in
being directed to Charlington Heath. It was im-
possible to mistake the scene of the young lady&#8217;s
</p>
<p>463</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist
</p>
<p>adventure, for the road runs between the open
heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon
the other, surrounding a park which is studded
with magnificent trees. There was a main gate-
way of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar sur-
mounted by mouldering heraldic emblems; but be-
sides this central carriage drive I observed several
points where there were gaps in the hedge and
paths leading through them. The house was invis-
ible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke
of gloom and decay.
</p>
<p>The heath was covered with golden patches
of flowering gorse, gleaming magnificently in the
light of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one
of these clumps I took up my position, so as to
command both the gateway of the Hall and a long
stretch of the road upon either side. It had been
deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist rid-
ing down it from the opposite direction to that in
which I had come. He was clad in a dark suit, and
I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the
end of the Charlington grounds he sprang from
his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge,
disappearing from my view.
</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed and then a sec-
ond cyclist appeared. This time it was the young
lady coming from the station. I saw her look about
her as she came to the Charlington hedge. An in-
stant later the man emerged from his hiding-place,
sprang upon his cycle, and followed her. In all
the broad landscape those were the only moving
figures, the graceful girl sitting very straight upon
her machine, and the man behind her bending low
over his handle-bar, with a curiously furtive sug-
gestion in every movement. She looked back at
him and slowed her pace. He slowed also. She
stopped. He at once stopped too, keeping two
hundred yards behind her. Her next movement
was as unexpected as it was spirited. She suddenly
whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at
him! He was as quick as she, however, and darted
off in desperate flight. Presently she came back up
the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not
deigning to take any further notice of her silent
attendant. He had turned also, and still kept his
distance until the curve of the road hid them from
my sight.
</p>
<p>I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well
that I did so, for presently the man reappeared cy-
cling slowly back. He turned in at the Hall gates
and dismounted from his machine. For some few
minutes I could see him standing among the trees.
His hands were raised and he seemed to be settling
his necktie. Then he mounted his cycle and rode
</p>
<p>away from me down the drive towards the Hall. I
ran across the heath and peered through the trees.
Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey
building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the
drive ran through a dense shrubbery, and I saw no
more of my man.
</p>
<p>However, it seemed to me that I had done a
fairly good morning&#8217;s work, and I walked back
in high spirits to Farnham. The local house-agent
could tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and
referred me to a well-known firm in Pall Mall.
There I halted on my way home, and met with
courtesy from the representative. No, I could not
have Charlington Hall for the summer. I was just
too late. It had been let about a month ago. Mr.
Williamson was the name of the tenant. He was
a respectable elderly gentleman. The polite agent
was afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of
his clients were not matters which he could dis-
cuss.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to
the long report which I was able to present to him
that evening, but it did not elicit that word of curt
praise which I had hoped for and should have val-
ued. On the contrary, his austere face was even
more severe than usual as he commented upon the
things that I had done and the things that I had
not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very
faulty. You should have been behind the hedge;
then you would have had a close view of this in-
teresting person. As it is you were some hundreds
of yards away, and can tell me even less than Miss
Smith. She thinks she does not know the man; I
am convinced she does. Why, otherwise, should
he be so desperately anxious that she should not
get so near him as to see his features? You describe
him as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment
again, you see. You really have done remarkably
badly. He returns to the house and you want to
find out who he is. You come to a London house-
agent!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What should I have done?&#8221; I cried, with some
heat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to the nearest public-house. That is the
centre of country gossip. They would have told
you every name, from the master to the scullery-
maid. Williamson! It conveys nothing to my mind.
If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist
who sprints away from that athletic young lady&#8217;s
pursuit. What have we gained by your expedition?
The knowledge that the girl&#8217;s story is true. I never
doubted it. That there is a connection between the
cyclist and the Hall. I never doubted that either.
</p>
<p>464</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who&#8217;s
the better for that? Well, well, my dear sir, don&#8217;t
look so depressed. We can do little more until next
Saturday, and in the meantime I may make one or
two inquiries myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith,
recounting shortly and accurately the very inci-
dents which I had seen, but the pith of the letter
lay in the postscript:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that you will respect my
confidence, Mr. Holmes, when I tell
you that my place here has become dif-
ficult owing to the fact that my em-
ployer has proposed marriage to me.
I am convinced that his feelings are
most deep and most honourable. At
the same time my promise is, of course,
given. He took my refusal very seri-
ously, but also very gently. You can un-
derstand, however, that the situation is
a little strained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our young friend seems to be getting into
deep waters,&#8221; said Holmes, thoughtfully, as he fin-
ished the letter. &#8220;The case certainly presents more
features of interest and more possibility of devel-
opment than I had originally thought. I should
be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the
country, and I am inclined to run down this af-
ternoon and test one or two theories which I have
formed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s quiet day in the country had a singu-
lar termination, for he arrived at Baker Street late
in the evening with a cut lip and a discoloured
lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of
dissipation which would have made his own per-
son the fitting object of a Scotland Yard investiga-
tion. He was immensely tickled by his own adven-
tures, and laughed heartily as he recounted them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I get so little active exercise that it is always a
treat,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You are aware that I have some
proficiency in the good old British sport of boxing.
Occasionally it is of service. To-day, for example, I
should have come to very ignominious grief with-
out it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I begged him to tell me what had occurred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found that country pub which I had already
recommended to your notice, and there I made my
discreet inquiries. I was in the bar, and a gar-
rulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted.
Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives
alone with a small staff of servants at the Hall.
There is some rumour that he is or has been a
</p>
<p>clergyman; but one or two incidents of his short
residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unec-
clesiastical. I have already made some inquiries
at a clerical agency, and they tell me that there
was a man of that name in orders whose career
has been a singularly dark one. The landlord fur-
ther informed me that there are usually week-end
visitors&#8212;&#8216;a warm lot, sir&#8217;&#8212;at the Hall, and espe-
cially one gentleman with a red moustache, Mr.
Woodley by name, who was always there. We had
got as far as this when who should walk in but
the gentleman himself, who had been drinking his
beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole con-
versation. Who was I? What did I want? What
did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine
flow of language, and his adjectives were very vig-
orous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious
back-hander which I failed to entirely avoid. The
next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight
left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you
see me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart. So
ended my country trip, and it must be confessed
that, however enjoyable, my day on the Surrey bor-
der has not been much more profitable than your
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Thursday brought us another letter from
our client.
</p>
<p>You will not be surprised, Mr.
Holmes [said she] to hear that I am
leaving Mr. Carruthers&#8217;s employment.
Even the high pay cannot reconcile me
to the discomforts of my situation. On
Saturday I come up to town and I do
not intend to return. Mr. Carruthers
has got a trap, and so the dangers of
the lonely road, if there ever were any
dangers, are now over.
</p>
<p>As to the special cause of my leav-
ing, it is not merely the strained situ-
ation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the
reappearance of that odious man, Mr.
Woodley. He was always hideous, but
he looks more awful than ever now, for
he appears to have had an accident and
he is much disfigured. I saw him out of
the window, but I am glad to say I did
not meet him. He had a long talk with
Mr. Carruthers, who seemed much ex-
cited afterwards. Woodley must be
staying in the neighbourhood, for he
did not sleep here, and yet I caught
a glimpse of him again this morning
slinking about in the shrubbery. I
would sooner have a savage wild ani-

</p>
<p>mal loose about the place. I loathe and
fear him more than I can say. How can
Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature
for a moment? However, all my trou-
bles will be over on Saturday.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I trust, Watson; so I trust,&#8221; said Holmes,
gravely. &#8220;There is some deep intrigue going on
round that little woman, and it is our duty to see
that no one molests her upon that last journey.
I think, Watson, that we must spare time to run
down together on Saturday morning, and make
sure that this curious and inconclusive investiga-
tion has no untoward ending.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I confess that I had not up to now taken a very
serious view of the case, which had seemed to me
rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous. That
a man should lie in wait for and follow a very
handsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if
he had so little audacity that he not only dared not
address her, but even fled from her approach, he
was not a very formidable assailant. The ruffian
Woodley was a very different person, but, except
on one occasion, he had not molested our client,
and now he visited the house of Carruthers with-
out intruding upon her presence. The man on the
bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end
parties at the Hall of which the publican had spo-
ken; but who he was or what he wanted was as ob-
scure as ever. It was the severity of Holmes&#8217;s man-
ner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his
pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed
me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to
lurk behind this curious train of events.
</p>
<p>A rainy night had been followed by a glo-
rious morning, and the heath-covered country-
side with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse
seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were
weary of the duns and drabs and slate-greys of
London. Holmes and I walked along the broad,
sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and
rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh
breath of the spring. From a rise of the road on
the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the
grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient
oaks, which, old as they were, were still younger
than the building which they surrounded. Holmes
pointed down the long tract of road which wound,
a reddish yellow band, between the brown of the
heath and the budding green of the woods. Far
away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle moving
in our direction. Holmes gave an exclamation of
impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had given a margin of half an hour,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;If that is her trap she must be making for the
</p>
<p>earlier train. I fear, Watson, that she will be past
Charlington before we can possibly meet her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the instant that we passed the rise we
could no longer see the vehicle, but we hastened
onwards at such a pace that my sedentary life be-
gan to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall
behind. Holmes, however, was always in train-
ing, for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous en-
ergy upon which to draw. His springy step never
slowed until suddenly, when he was a hundred
yards in front of me, he halted, and I saw him
throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and de-
spair. At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the
horse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared round
the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards
us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late, Watson; too late!&#8221; cried Holmes, as
I ran panting to his side. &#8220;Fool that I was not to
allow for that earlier train! It&#8217;s abduction, Wat-
son&#8212;abduction! Murder! Heaven knows what!
Block the road! Stop the horse! That&#8217;s right. Now,
jump in, and let us see if I can repair the conse-
quences of my own blunder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes,
after turning the horse, gave it a sharp cut with
the whip, and we flew back along the road. As we
turned the curve the whole stretch of road between
the Hall and the heath was opened up. I grasped
Holmes&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man!&#8221; I gasped.
A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His
</p>
<p>head was down and his shoulders rounded as he
put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to
the pedals. He was flying like a racer. Suddenly he
raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and
pulled up, springing from his machine. That coal-
black beard was in singular contrast to the pallor
of his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had
a fever. He stared at us and at the dog-cart. Then
a look of amazement came over his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa! Stop there!&#8221; he shouted, holding his
bicycle to block our road. &#8220;Where did you get that
dog-cart? Pull up, man!&#8221; he yelled, drawing a pis-
tol from his side pocket. &#8220;Pull up, I say, or, by
George, I&#8217;ll put a bullet into your horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang
down from the cart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the man we want to see. Where is Miss
Violet Smith?&#8221; he said, in his quick, clear way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am asking you. You&#8217;re in her
dog-cart. You ought to know where she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We met the dog-cart on the road. There was
no one in it. We drove back to help the young
lady.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Good Lord! Good Lord! what shall I
do?&#8221; cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got her, that hellhound Woodley and the
blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you re-
ally are her friend. Stand by me and we&#8217;ll save her,
if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington Wood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, to-
wards a gap in the hedge. Holmes followed him,
and I, leaving the horse grazing beside the road,
followed Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where they came through,&#8221; said he,
pointing to the marks of several feet upon the
muddy path. &#8220;Halloa! Stop a minute! Who&#8217;s this
in the bush?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed
like an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters. He
lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a terrible
cut upon his head. He was insensible, but alive. A
glance at his wound told me that it had not pene-
trated the bone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Peter, the groom,&#8221; cried the stranger.
&#8220;He drove her. The beasts have pulled him off and
clubbed him. Let him lie; we can&#8217;t do him any
good, but we may save her from the worst fate that
can befall a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We ran frantically down the path, which
wound among the trees. We had reached the
shrubbery which surrounded the house when
Holmes pulled up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t go to the house. Here are their
marks on the left&#8212;here, beside the laurel bushes!
Ah, I said so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke a woman&#8217;s shrill scream&#8212;a
scream which vibrated with a frenzy of hor-
ror&#8212;burst from the thick green clump of bushes
in front of us. It ended suddenly on its highest
note with a choke and a gurgle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This way! This way! They are in the bowl-
ing alley,&#8221; cried the stranger, darting through the
bushes. &#8220;Ah, the cowardly dogs! Follow me, gen-
tlemen! Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of
greensward surrounded by ancient trees. On the
farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty
oak, there stood a singular group of three peo-
ple. One was a woman, our client, drooping and
faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite
her stood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached
young man, his gaitered legs parted wide, one
arm akimbo, the other waving a riding-crop, his
whole attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado.
Between them an elderly, grey-bearded man, wear-
ing a short surplice over a light tweed suit, had
</p>
<p>evidently just completed the wedding service, for
he pocketed his prayer-book as we appeared and
slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in
jovial congratulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re married!&#8221; I gasped.
&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried our guide; &#8220;come on!&#8221; He
</p>
<p>rushed across the glade, Holmes and I at his heels.
As we approached, the lady staggered against the
trunk of the tree for support. Williamson, the ex-
clergyman, bowed to us with mock politeness, and
the bully Woodley advanced with a shout of brutal
and exultant laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take your beard off, Bob,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
know you right enough. Well, you and your pals
have just come in time for me to be able to intro-
duce you to Mrs. Woodley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our guide&#8217;s answer was a singular one. He
snatched off the dark beard which had disguised
him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a
long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he
raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian,
who was advancing upon him with his dangerous
riding-crop swinging in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said our ally, &#8220;I am Bob Carruthers, and
I&#8217;ll see this woman righted if I have to swing for it.
I told you what I&#8217;d do if you molested her, and, by
the Lord, I&#8217;ll be as good as my word!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too late. She&#8217;s my wife!&#8221;
&#8220;No, she&#8217;s your widow.&#8221;
His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt
</p>
<p>from the front of Woodley&#8217;s waistcoat. He spun
round with a scream and fell upon his back, his
hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful
mottled pallor. The old man, still clad in his sur-
plice, burst into such a string of foul oaths as I have
never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own,
but before he could raise it he was looking down
the barrel of Holmes&#8217;s weapon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough of this,&#8221; said my friend, coldly. &#8220;Drop
that pistol! Watson, pick it up! Hold it to his head!
Thank you. You, Carruthers, give me that revolver.
We&#8217;ll have no more violence. Come, hand it over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, then?&#8221;
&#8220;My name is Sherlock Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221;
&#8220;You have heard of me, I see. I will represent
</p>
<p>the official police until their arrival. Here, you!&#8221;
he shouted to a frightened groom who had ap-
peared at the edge of the glade. &#8220;Come here. Take
this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham.&#8221; He
scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his note-
book. &#8220;Give it to the superintendent at the police-
station. Until he comes I must detain you all under
my personal custody.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist
</p>
<p>The strong, masterful personality of Holmes
dominated the tragic scene, and all were equally
puppets in his hands. Williamson and Carruthers
found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley
into the house, and I gave my arm to the fright-
ened girl. The injured man was laid on his bed,
and at Holmes&#8217;s request I examined him. I carried
my report to where he sat in the old tapestry-hung
dining-room with his two prisoners before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will live,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Carruthers, springing out of his
chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go upstairs and finish him first. Do you
tell me that that girl, that angel, is to be tied to
Roaring Jack Woodley for life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not concern yourself about that,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;There are two very good reasons
why she should under no circumstances be his
wife. In the first place, we are very safe in ques-
tioning Mr. Williamson&#8217;s right to solemnize a mar-
riage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been ordained,&#8221; cried the old rascal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And also unfrocked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. How about the license?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a license for the marriage. I have it
here in my pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you got it by a trick. But in any case a
forced marriage is no marriage, but it is a very se-
rious felony, as you will discover before you have
finished. You&#8217;ll have time to think the point out
during the next ten years or so, unless I am mis-
taken. As to you, Carruthers, you would have
done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes; but when I
thought of all the precaution I had taken to shield
this girl&#8212;for I loved her, Mr. Holmes, and it is the
only time that ever I knew what love was&#8212;it fairly
drove me mad to think that she was in the power of
the greatest brute and bully in South Africa, a man
whose name is a holy terror from Kimberley to Jo-
hannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes, you&#8217;ll hardly be-
lieve it, but ever since that girl has been in my em-
ployment I never once let her go past this house,
where I knew these rascals were lurking, without
following her on my bicycle just to see that she
came to no harm. I kept my distance from her,
and I wore a beard so that she should not recog-
nise me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl,
and she wouldn&#8217;t have stayed in my employment
long if she had thought that I was following her
about the country roads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell her of her danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because then, again, she would have left me,
and I couldn&#8217;t bear to face that. Even if she
couldn&#8217;t love me it was a great deal to me just to
see her dainty form about the house, and to hear
the sound of her voice.&#8221;
