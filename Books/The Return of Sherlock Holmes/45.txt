<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>t was in the year &#8217;95 that a combination
of events, into which I need not enter,
caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself
to spend some weeks in one of our great
</p>
<p>University towns, and it was during this time that
the small but instructive adventure which I am
about to relate befell us. It will be obvious that
any details which would help the reader to exactly
identify the college or the criminal would be inju-
dicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may
well be allowed to die out. With due discretion the
incident itself may, however, be described, since
it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for
which my friend was remarkable. I will endeav-
our in my statement to avoid such terms as would
serve to limit the events to any particular place, or
give a clue as to the people concerned.
</p>
<p>We were residing at the time in furnished lodg-
ings close to a library where Sherlock Holmes was
pursuing some laborious researches in early En-
glish charters&#8212;researches which led to results so
striking that they may be the subject of one of my
future narratives. Here it was that one evening we
received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton
Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St.
Luke&#8217;s. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare man, of a
nervous and excitable temperament. I had always
known him to be restless in his manner, but on this
particular occasion he was in such a state of uncon-
trollable agitation that it was clear something very
unusual had occurred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a
few hours of your valuable time. We have had a
very painful incident at St. Luke&#8217;s, and really, but
for the happy chance of your being in the town, I
should have been at a loss what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very busy just now, and I desire no dis-
tractions,&#8221; my friend answered. &#8220;I should much
prefer that you called in the aid of the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly
impossible. When once the law is evoked it can-
not be stayed again, and this is just one of those
cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most
essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as
well known as your powers, and you are the one
man in the world who can help me. I beg you, Mr.
Holmes, to do what you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend&#8217;s temper had not improved since he
had been deprived of the congenial surroundings
of Baker Street. Without his scrap-books, his chem-
icals, and his homely untidiness, he was an un-
comfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in
</p>
<p>ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hur-
ried words and with much excitable gesticulation
poured forth his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-
morrow is the first day of the examination for the
Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the examiners.
My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers
consists of a large passage of Greek translation
which the candidate has not seen. This passage
is printed on the examination paper, and it would
naturally be an immense advantage if the candi-
date could prepare it in advance. For this reason
great care is taken to keep the paper secret.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day about three o&#8217;clock the proofs of this
paper arrived from the printers. The exercise con-
sists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I had to read
it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely cor-
rect. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.
I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend&#8217;s
rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk. I was
absent rather more than an hour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college
doors are double&#8212;a green baize one within and a
heavy oak one without. As I approached my outer
door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant
I imagined that I had left my own there, but on
feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.
The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew,
was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister,
a man who has looked after my room for ten years,
and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. I
found that the key was indeed his, that he had en-
tered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he
had very carelessly left the key in the door when
he came out. His visit to my room must have been
within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
forgetfulness about the key would have mattered
little upon any other occasion, but on this one day
it has produced the most deplorable consequences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment I looked at my table I was aware
that someone had rummaged among my papers.
The proof was in three long slips. I had left them
all together. Now, I found that one of them was
lying on the floor, one was on the side table near
the window, and the third was where I had left it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes stirred for the first time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first page on the floor, the second in the
window, the third where you left it,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How
could you possibly know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray continue your very interesting state-
ment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>523</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Students
</p>
<p>&#8220;For an instant I imagined that Bannister had
taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my
papers. He denied it, however, with the ut-
most earnestness, and I am convinced that he was
speaking the truth. The alternative was that some-
one passing had observed the key in the door, had
known that I was out, and had entered to look at
the papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for
the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an un-
scrupulous man might very well run a risk in order
to gain an advantage over his fellows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bannister was very much upset by the inci-
dent. He had nearly fainted when we found that
the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with.
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed
in a chair while I made a most careful examination
of the room. I soon saw that the intruder had left
other traces of his presence besides the rumpled
papers. On the table in the window were several
shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A
broken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently
the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry,
had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to
put a fresh point to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Holmes, who was recovering
his good-humour as his attention became more
engrossed by the case. &#8220;Fortune has been your
friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not all. I have a new writing-table
with a fine surface of red leather. I am prepared
to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth
and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about
three inches long&#8212;not a mere scratch, but a pos-
itive cut. Not only this, but on the table I found
a small ball of black dough, or clay, with specks
of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am
convinced that these marks were left by the man
who rifled the papers. There were no footmarks
and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at
my wits&#8217; ends, when suddenly the happy thought
occurred to me that you were in the town, and I
came straight round to put the matter into your
hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes! You see my
dilemma. Either I must find the man or else the
examination must be postponed until fresh papers
are prepared, and since this cannot be done with-
out explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal,
which will throw a cloud not only on the college,
but on the University. Above all things I desire to
settle the matter quietly and discreetly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to look into it and to give
you such advice as I can,&#8221; said Holmes, rising and
putting on his overcoat. &#8220;The case is not entirely
</p>
<p>devoid of interest. Had anyone visited you in your
room after the papers came to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; young Daulat Ras, an Indian student who
lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some
particulars about the examination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For which he was entered?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;And the papers were on your table?&#8221;
&#8220;To the best of my belief they were rolled up.&#8221;
&#8220;But might be recognised as proofs?&#8221;
&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;
&#8220;No one else in your room?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Did anyone know that these proofs would be
</p>
<p>there?&#8221;
&#8220;No one save the printer.&#8221;
&#8220;Did this man Bannister know?&#8221;
&#8220;No, certainly not. No one knew.&#8221;
&#8220;Where is Bannister now?&#8221;
&#8220;He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him col-
</p>
<p>lapsed in the chair. I was in such a hurry to come
to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You left your door open?&#8221;
&#8220;I locked up the papers first.&#8221;
&#8220;Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames, that un-
</p>
<p>less the Indian student recognised the roll as being
proofs, the man who tampered with them came
upon them accidentally without knowing that they
were there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems to me.&#8221;
Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let us go round. Not one
</p>
<p>of your cases, Watson&#8212;mental, not physical. All
right; come if you want to. Now, Mr. Soames&#8212;at
your disposal!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sitting-room of our client opened by a long,
low, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-
tinted court of the old college. A Gothic arched
door led to a worn stone staircase. On the ground
floor was the tutor&#8217;s room. Above were three
students, one on each story. It was already twi-
light when we reached the scene of our problem.
Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the win-
dow. Then he approached it, and, standing on tip-
toe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have entered through the door. There
is no opening except the one pane,&#8221; said our
learned guide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Holmes, and he smiled in a
singular way as he glanced at our companion.
&#8220;Well, if there is nothing to be learned here we
had best go inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>524</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ush-
ered us into his room. We stood at the entrance
while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid there are no signs here,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.
Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You
left him in a chair, you say; which chair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the window there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Near this little table. You can come in
now. I have finished with the carpet. Let us take
the little table first. Of course, what has happened
is very clear. The man entered and took the papers,
sheet by sheet, from the central table. He carried
them over to the window table, because from there
he could see if you came across the courtyard, and
so could effect an escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact he could not,&#8221; said Soames,
&#8220;for I entered by the side door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s good! Well, anyhow, that was in his
mind. Let me see the three strips. No finger im-
pressions&#8212;no! Well, he carried over this one first
and he copied it. How long would it take him to
do that, using every possible contraction? A quar-
ter of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and
seized the next. He was in the midst of that when
your return caused him to make a very hurried
retreat&#8212;very hurried, since he had not time to re-
place the papers which would tell you that he had
been there. You were not aware of any hurrying
feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his
pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it
again. This is of interest, Watson. The pencil was
not an ordinary one. It was above the usual size,
with a soft lead; the outer colour was dark blue,
the maker&#8217;s name was printed in silver lettering,
and the piece remaining is only about an inch and
a half long. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames,
and you have got your man. When I add that he
possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have
an additional aid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by
this flood of information. &#8220;I can follow the other
points,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but really, in this matter of the
length&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes held out a small chip with the letters
NN and a space of clear wood after them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I fear that even now&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson, I have always done you an injustice.
There are others. What could this NN be? It is
</p>
<p>at the end of a word. You are aware that Johann
Faber is the most common maker&#8217;s name. Is it not
clear that there is just as much of the pencil left
as usually follows the Johann?&#8221; He held the small
table sideways to the electric light. &#8220;I was hoping
that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some
trace of it might come through upon this polished
surface. No, I see nothing. I don&#8217;t think there is
anything more to be learned here. Now for the
central table. This small pellet is, I presume, the
black, doughy mass you spoke of. Roughly pyra-
midal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As
you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.
Dear me, this is very interesting. And the cut&#8212;a
positive tear, I see. It began with a thin scratch and
ended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to you
for directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames.
Where does that door lead to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To my bedroom.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you been in it since your adventure?&#8221;
&#8220;No; I came straight away for you.&#8221;
&#8220;I should like to have a glance round. What a
</p>
<p>charming, old-fashioned room! Perhaps you will
kindly wait a minute until I have examined the
floor. No, I see nothing. What about this curtain?
You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were
forced to conceal himself in this room he must do
it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe
too shallow. No one there, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from
some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude,
that he was prepared for an emergency. As a mat-
ter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but
three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of
pegs. Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly
to the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa! What&#8217;s this?&#8221; said he.
It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like
</p>
<p>stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the
study. Holmes held it out on his open palm in
the glare of the electric light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your visitor seems to have left traces in your
bedroom as well as in your sitting-room, Mr.
Soames.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What could he have wanted there?&#8221;
&#8220;I think it is clear enough. You came back by an
</p>
<p>unexpected way, and so he had no warning until
you were at the very door. What could he do? He
caught up everything which would betray him and
he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to
tell me that all the time I was talking to Bannister
in this room we had the man prisoner if we had
only known it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>525</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Students
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I read it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely there is another alternative, Mr.
Holmes. I don&#8217;t know whether you observed my
bedroom window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lattice-paned, lead framework, three sepa-
rate windows, one swinging on hinge and large
enough to admit a man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the
courtyard so as to be partly invisible. The man
might have effected his entrance there, left traces
as he passed through the bedroom, and, finally,
finding the door open have escaped that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us be practical,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I understand
you to say that there are three students who use
this stair and are in the habit of passing your
door?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they are all in for this examination?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any reason to suspect any one of
them more than the others?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Soames hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very delicate question,&#8221; said he. &#8220;One
hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no
proofs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the
proofs.&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you, then, in a few words the charac-
ter of the three men who inhabit these rooms. The
lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and
athlete; plays in the Rugby team and the cricket
team for the college, and got his Blue for the hur-
dles and the long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow.
His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist,
who ruined himself on the turf. My scholar has
been left very poor, but he is hard-working and
industrious. He will do well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras,
the Indian. He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow, as
most of those Indians are. He is well up in his
work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is
steady and methodical.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He
is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work&#8212;one
of the brightest intellects of the University, but he
is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. He was
nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.
He has been idling all this term, and he must look
forward with dread to the examination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is he whom you suspect?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not go so far as that. But of the three he
is perhaps the least unlikely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look
at your servant, Bannister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven,
grizzly-haired fellow of fifty. He was still suffering
from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine
of his life. His plump face was twitching with his
nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are investigating this unhappy business,
Bannister,&#8221; said his master.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that you left
</p>
<p>your key in the door?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Was it not very extraordinary that you should
</p>
<p>do this on the very day when there were these pa-
pers inside?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was most unfortunate, sir. But I have occa-
sionally done the same thing at other times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you enter the room?&#8221;
&#8220;It was about half-past four. That is Mr.
</p>
<p>Soames&#8217;s tea time.&#8221;
&#8220;How long did you stay?&#8221;
&#8220;When I saw that he was absent I withdrew at
</p>
<p>once.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you look at these papers on the table?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;How came you to leave the key in the door?&#8221;
&#8220;I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I
</p>
<p>would come back for the key. Then I forgot.&#8221;
&#8220;Has the outer door a spring lock?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Then it was open all the time?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Anyone in the room could get out?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;When Mr. Soames returned and called for
</p>
<p>you, you were very much disturbed?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened dur-
</p>
<p>ing the many years that I have been here. I nearly
fainted, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand. Where were you when you
began to feel bad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.&#8221;
&#8220;That is singular, because you sat down in that
</p>
<p>chair over yonder near the corner. Why did you
pass these other chairs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. It didn&#8217;t matter to me where
I sat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>526</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think he knew much about it,
Mr. Holmes. He was looking very bad&#8212;quite
ghastly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stayed here when your master left?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the
door and went to my room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don&#8217;t be-
lieve there is any gentleman in this University who
is capable of profiting by such an action. No, sir,
I&#8217;ll not believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; that will do,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Oh,
one more word. You have not mentioned to any
of the three gentlemen whom you attend that any-
thing is amiss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; not a word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen any of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a
walk in the quadrangle, if you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three yellow squares of light shone above us in
the gathering gloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your three birds are all in their nests,&#8221; said
Holmes, looking up. &#8220;Halloa! What&#8217;s that? One of
them seems restless enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette ap-
peared suddenly upon his blind. He was pacing
swiftly up and down his room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to have a peep at each of them,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No difficulty in the world,&#8221; Soames answered.
&#8220;This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college,
and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
Come along, and I will personally conduct you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No names, please!&#8221; said Holmes, as we
knocked at Gilchrist&#8217;s door. A tall, flaxen-haired,
slim young fellow opened it, and made us wel-
come when he understood our errand. There were
some really curious pieces of mediaeval domes-
tic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed
with one of them that he insisted on drawing it
on his note-book, broke his pencil, had to borrow
one from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to
sharpen his own. The same curious accident hap-
pened to him in the rooms of the Indian&#8212;a silent,
little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance and
was obviously glad when Holmes&#8217;s architectural
studies had come to an end. I could not see that
in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for
which he was searching. Only at the third did
our visit prove abortive. The outer door would
</p>
<p>not open to our knock, and nothing more substan-
tial than a torrent of bad language came from be-
hind it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who you are. You can go to
blazes!&#8221; roared the angry voice. &#8220;To-morrow&#8217;s the
exam, and I won&#8217;t be drawn by anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A rude fellow,&#8221; said our guide, flushing with
anger as we withdrew down the stair. &#8220;Of course,
he did not realize that it was I who was knocking,
but none the less his conduct was very uncourte-
ous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather
suspicious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s response was a curious one.
&#8220;Can you tell me his exact height?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say.
</p>
<p>He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist.
I suppose five foot six would be about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very important,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;And
now, Mr. Soames, I wish you good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and
dismay. &#8220;Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, you are
surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion!
You don&#8217;t seem to realize the position. To-morrow
is the examination. I must take some definite ac-
tion to-night. I cannot allow the examination to be
held if one of the papers has been tampered with.
The situation must be faced.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round
early to-morrow morning and chat the matter over.
It is possible that I may be in a position then to
indicate some course of action. Meanwhile you
change nothing&#8212;nothing at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We
</p>
<p>shall certainly find some way out of your difficul-
ties. I will take the black clay with me, also the
pencil cuttings. Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we were out in the darkness of the quad-
rangle we again looked up at the windows. The
Indian still paced his room. The others were invis-
ible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, what do you think of it?&#8221;
Holmes asked, as we came out into the main street.
&#8220;Quite a little parlour game&#8212;sort of three-card
trick, is it not? There are your three men. It must
be one of them. You take your choice. Which is
yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the
one with the worst record. And yet that Indian
was a sly fellow also. Why should he be pacing
his room all the time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in that. Many men do it
when they are trying to learn anything by heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked at us in a queer way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>527</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Three Students
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would you if a flock of strangers came in
on you when you were preparing for an examina-
tion next day, and every moment was of value. No,
I see nothing in that. Pencils, too, and knives&#8212;all
was satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bannister, the servant. What&#8217;s his game
in the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He impressed me as being a perfectly honest
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So he did me. That&#8217;s the puzzling part. Why
should a perfectly honest man&#8212;well, well, here&#8217;s
a large stationer&#8217;s. We shall begin our researches
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were only four stationers of any conse-
quence in the town, and at each Holmes produced
his pencil chips and bid high for a duplicate. All
were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it
was not a usual size of pencil and that it was sel-
dom kept in stock. My friend did not appear to be
depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoul-
ders in half-humorous resignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and
only final clue, has run to nothing. But, indeed,
I have little doubt that we can build up a suffi-
cient case without it. By Jove! my dear fellow, it
is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green
peas at seven-thirty. What with your eternal to-
bacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I
expect that you will get notice to quit and that
I shall share your downfall&#8212;not, however, before
we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor,
the careless servant, and the three enterprising stu-
dents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes made no further allusion to the mat-
ter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a
long time after our belated dinner. At eight in the
morning he came into my room just as I finished
my toilet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is time we went
down to St. Luke&#8217;s. Can you do without break-
fast?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we
are able to tell him something positive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you anything positive to tell him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have formed a conclusion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear Watson; I have solved the mys-
tery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what fresh evidence could you have got?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha! It is not for nothing that I have turned
myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six. I
have put in two hours&#8217; hard work and covered
at least five miles, with something to show for it.
Look at that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held out his hand. On the palm were three
little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday!&#8221;
&#8220;And one more this morning. It is a fair argu-
</p>
<p>ment that wherever No. 3 came from is also the
source of Nos. 1 and 2. Eh, Watson? Well, come
along and put friend Soames out of his pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of
pitiable agitation when we found him in his cham-
bers. In a few hours the examination would com-
mence, and he was still in the dilemma between
making the facts public and allowing the culprit
to compete for the valuable scholarship. He could
hardly stand still, so great was his mental agita-
tion, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager
hands outstretched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven that you have come! I feared
that you had given it up in despair. What am I to
do? Shall the examination proceed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; let it proceed by all means.&#8221;
&#8220;But this rascal&#8212;?&#8221;
&#8220;He shall not compete.&#8221;
&#8220;You know him?&#8221;
&#8220;I think so. If this matter is not to become pub-
</p>
<p>lic we must give ourselves certain powers, and re-
solve ourselves into a small private court-martial.
You there, if you please, Soames! Watson, you
here! I&#8217;ll take the arm-chair in the middle. I think
that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike ter-
ror into a guilty breast. Kindly ring the bell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bannister entered, and shrunk back in evident
surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will kindly close the door,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth
about yesterday&#8217;s incident?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man turned white to the roots of his hair.
&#8220;I have told you everything, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing to add?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing at all, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, I must make some suggestions to
</p>
<p>you. When you sat down on that chair yester-
day, did you do so in order to conceal some ob-
ject which would have shown who had been in the
room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bannister&#8217;s face was ghastly.
&#8220;No, sir; certainly not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>528</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;It is only a suggestion,&#8221; said Holmes, suavely.
&#8220;I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it. But it
seems probable enough, since the moment that Mr.
Soames&#8217;s back was turned you released the man
who was hiding in that bedroom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bannister licked his dry lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no man, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a pity, Bannister. Up to now you
may have spoken the truth, but now I know that
you have lied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face set in sullen defiance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no man, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Bannister!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; there was no one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case you can give us no further infor-
mation. Would you please remain in the room?
Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now,
Soames, I am going to ask you to have the great
kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist,
and to ask him to step down into yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An instant later the tutor returned, bringing
with him the student. He was a fine figure of
a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step
and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes
glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an
expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the
farther corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just close the door,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Now, Mr.
Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one
need ever know one word of what passes between
us. We can be perfectly frank with each other.
We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an hon-
ourable man, ever came to commit such an action
as that of yesterday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The unfortunate young man staggered back
and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Ban-
nister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir; I never said a
word&#8212;never one word!&#8221; cried the servant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you have now,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Now,
sir, you must see that after Bannister&#8217;s words your
position is hopeless, and that your only chance lies
in a frank confession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand,
tried to control his writhing features. The next he
had thrown himself on his knees beside the table
and, burying his face in his hands, he had burst
into a storm of passionate sobbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said Holmes, kindly; &#8220;it is hu-
man to err, and at least no one can accuse you of
</p>
<p>being a callous criminal. Perhaps it would be eas-
ier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames what oc-
curred, and you can check me where I am wrong.
Shall I do so? Well, well, don&#8217;t trouble to answer.
Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said
to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have
told that the papers were in your room, the case
began to take a definite shape in my mind. The
printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could ex-
amine the papers in his own office. The Indian I
also thought nothing of. If the proofs were in a
roll he could not possibly know what they were.
On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coin-
cidence that a man should dare to enter the room,
and that by chance on that very day the papers
were on the table. I dismissed that. The man who
entered knew that the papers were there. How did
he know?
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I approached your room I examined the
window. You amused me by supposing that I was
contemplating the possibility of someone having
in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these op-
posite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an
idea was absurd. I was measuring how tall a man
would need to be in order to see as he passed
what papers were on the central table. I am six
feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one
less than that would have a chance. Already you
see I had reason to think that if one of your three
students was a man of unusual height he was the
most worth watching of the three.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I entered and I took you into my confidence
as to the suggestions of the side table. Of the cen-
tre table I could make nothing, until in your de-
scription of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a
long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came
to me in an instant, and I only needed certain cor-
roborative proofs, which I speedily obtained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened was this. This young fel-
low had employed his afternoon at the athletic
grounds, where he had been practising the jump.
He returned carrying his jumping shoes, which are
provided, as you are aware, with several sharp
spikes. As he passed your window he saw, by
means of his great height, these proofs upon your
table, and conjectured what they were. No harm
would have been done had it not been that as he
passed your door he perceived the key which had
been left by the carelessness of your servant. A
sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if
they were indeed the proofs. It was not a danger-
ous exploit, for he could always pretend that he
had simply looked in to ask a question.
</p>
<p>529</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Well, when he saw that they were indeed the
proofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation.
He put his shoes on the table. What was it you put
on that chair near the window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gloves,&#8221; said the young man.
Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. &#8220;He
</p>
<p>put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs,
sheet by sheet, to copy them. He thought the
tutor must return by the main gate, and that he
would see him. As we know, he came back by
the side gate. Suddenly he heard him at the very
door. There was no possible escape. He forgot his
gloves, but he caught up his shoes and darted into
the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that
table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direc-
tion of the bedroom door. That in itself is enough
to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that di-
rection and that the culprit had taken refuge there.
The earth round the spike had been left on the ta-
ble, and a second sample was loosened and fell
in the bedroom. I may add that I walked out to
the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tena-
cious black clay is used in the jumping-pit, and
carried away a specimen of it, together with some
of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it
to prevent the athlete from slipping. Have I told
the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The student had drawn himself erect.
&#8220;Yes, sir, it is true,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Good heavens, have you nothing to add?&#8221;
</p>
<p>cried Soames.
&#8220;Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful exposure has bewildered me. I have a letter
here, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you early this
morning in the middle of a restless night. It was
before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here
it is, sir. You will see that I have said, &#8216;I have deter-
mined not to go in for the examination. I have been
offered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and
I am going out to South Africa at once.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not
intend to profit by your unfair advantage,&#8221; said
Soames. &#8220;But why did you change your purpose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the man who set me in the right
path,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, Bannister,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;It will
be clear to you from what I have said that only
you could have let this young man out, since you
were left in the room, and must have locked the
door when you went out. As to his escaping by
that window, it was incredible. Can you not clear
up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the
reasons for your action?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was simple enough, sir, if you only had
known; but with all your cleverness it was impos-
sible that you could know. Time was, sir, when
I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young
gentleman&#8217;s father. When he was ruined I came to
the college as servant, but I never forgot my old
employer because he was down in the world. I
watched his son all I could for the sake of the old
days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yester-
day when the alarm was given, the very first thing
I saw was Mr. Gilchrist&#8217;s tan gloves a-lying in that
chair. I knew those gloves well, and I understood
their message. If Mr. Soames saw them the game
was up. I flopped down into that chair, and noth-
ing would budge me until Mr. Soames he went for
you. Then out came my poor young master, whom
I had dandled on my knee,
