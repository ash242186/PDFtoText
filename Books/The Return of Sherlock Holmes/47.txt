Three-Quarter</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>W</p>
<p>e were fairly accustomed to receive
weird telegrams at Baker Street, but
I have a particular recollection of one
which reached us on a gloomy Febru-
</p>
<p>ary morning some seven or eight years ago and
gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an
hour. It was addressed to him, and ran thus:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please await me. Terrible misfortune.
Right wing three-quarter missing; in-
dispensable to-morrow.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Overton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strand post-mark and dispatched ten-thirty-
six,&#8221; said Holmes, reading it over and over. &#8220;Mr.
Overton was evidently considerably excited when
he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in conse-
quence. Well, well, he will be here, I dare say, by
the time I have looked through the times, and then
we shall know all about it. Even the most insignif-
icant problem would be welcome in these stagnant
days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Things had indeed been very slow with us, and
I had learned to dread such periods of inaction, for
I knew by experience that my companion&#8217;s brain
was so abnormally active that it was dangerous
to leave it without material upon which to work.
For years I had gradually weaned him from that
drug mania which had threatened once to check
his remarkable career. Now I knew that under or-
dinary conditions he no longer craved for this arti-
ficial stimulus, but I was well aware that the fiend
was not dead, but sleeping; and I have known
that the sleep was a light one and the waking near
when in periods of idleness I have seen the drawn
look upon Holmes&#8217;s ascetic face, and the brood-
ing of his deep-set and inscrutable eyes. There-
fore I blessed this Mr. Overton, whoever he might
be, since he had come with his enigmatic message
to break that dangerous calm which brought more
peril to my friend than all the storms of his tem-
pestuous life.
</p>
<p>As we had expected, the telegram was soon fol-
lowed by its sender, and the card of Mr. Cyril Over-
ton, of Trinity College, Cambridge, announced the
arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone
of solid bone and muscle, who spanned the door-
way with his broad shoulders and looked from one
of us to the other with a comely face which was
haggard with anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&#8221;
My companion bowed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>I saw Inspector Stanley Hopkins. He advised me
</p>
<p>to come to you. He said the case, so far as he could
see, was more in your line than in that of the reg-
ular police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s awful, Mr. Holmes, simply awful! I won-
</p>
<p>der my hair isn&#8217;t grey. Godfrey Staunton&#8212;you&#8217;ve
heard of him, of course? He&#8217;s simply the hinge
that the whole team turns on. I&#8217;d rather spare
two from the pack and have Godfrey for my three-
quarter line. Whether it&#8217;s passing, or tackling, or
dribbling, there&#8217;s no one to touch him; and then,
he&#8217;s got the head and can hold us all together.
What am I to do? That&#8217;s what I ask you, Mr.
Holmes. There&#8217;s Moorhouse, first reserve, but he
is trained as a half, and he always edges right in on
to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch-
line. He&#8217;s a fine place-kick, it&#8217;s true, but, then,
he has no judgment, and he can&#8217;t sprint for nuts.
Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford fliers, could
romp round him. Stevenson is fast enough, but
he couldn&#8217;t drop from the twenty-five line, and a
three-quarter who can&#8217;t either punt or drop isn&#8217;t
worth a place for pace alone. No, Mr. Holmes, we
are done unless you can help me to find Godfrey
Staunton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend had listened with amused surprise
to this long speech, which was poured forth with
extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point
being driven home by the slapping of a brawny
hand upon the speaker&#8217;s knee. When our visitor
was silent Holmes stretched out his hand and took
down letter &#8220;S&#8221; of his commonplace book. For
once he dug in vain into that mine of varied in-
formation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Arthur H. Staunton, the rising young
forger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and there was Henry Staunton,
whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton is a
new name to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was our visitor&#8217;s turn to look surprised.
&#8220;Why, Mr. Holmes, I thought you knew
</p>
<p>things,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I suppose, then, if you have
never heard of Godfrey Staunton you don&#8217;t know
Cyril Overton either?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head good-humouredly.
&#8220;Great Scot!&#8221; cried the athlete. &#8220;Why, I was
</p>
<p>first reserve for England against Wales, and I&#8217;ve
skippered the &#8217;Varsity all this year. But that&#8217;s noth-
ing! I didn&#8217;t think there was a soul in England who
didn&#8217;t know Godfrey Staunton, the crack three-
quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and five Interna-
tionals. Good Lord! Mr. Holmes, where have you
lived?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laughed at the young giant&#8217;s naive as-
tonishment.
</p>
<p>547</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter
</p>
<p>&#8220;You live in a different world to me, Mr. Over-
ton, a sweeter and healthier one. My ramifications
stretch out into many sections of society, but never,
I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is
the best and soundest thing in England. However,
your unexpected visit this morning shows me that
even in that world of fresh air and fair play there
may be work for me to do; so now, my good sir, I
beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and qui-
etly exactly what it is that has occurred, and how
you desire that I should help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Young Overton&#8217;s face assumed the bothered
look of the man who is more accustomed to us-
ing his muscles than his wits; but by degrees, with
many repetitions and obscurities which I may omit
from his narrative, he laid his strange story before
us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, Mr. Holmes. As I have said, I
am the skipper of the Rugger team of Cambridge
&#8217;Varsity, and Godfrey Staunton is my best man. To-
morrow we play Oxford. Yesterday we all came up
and we settled at Bentley&#8217;s private hotel. At ten
o&#8217;clock I went round and saw that all the fellows
had gone to roost, for I believe in strict training
and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. I had a
word or two with Godfrey before he turned in. He
seemed to me to be pale and bothered. I asked him
what was the matter. He said he was all right&#8212;just
a touch of headache. I bade him good-night and
left him. Half an hour later the porter tells me
that a rough-looking man with a beard called with
a note for Godfrey. He had not gone to bed and
the note was taken to his room. Godfrey read it
and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-
axed. The porter was so scared that he was going
to fetch me, but Godfrey stopped him, had a drink
of water, and pulled himself together. Then he
went downstairs, said a few words to the man who
was waiting in the hall, and the two of them went
off together. The last that the porter saw of them,
they were almost running down the street in the
direction of the Strand. This morning Godfrey&#8217;s
room was empty, his bed had never been slept in,
and his things were all just as I had seen them the
night before. He had gone off at a moment&#8217;s no-
tice with this stranger, and no word has come from
him since. I don&#8217;t believe he will ever come back.
He was a sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his
marrow, and he wouldn&#8217;t have stopped his train-
ing and let in his skipper if it were not for some
cause that was too strong for him. No; I feel as if
he were gone for good and we should never see
him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes listened with the deepest at-
tention to this singular narrative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had
</p>
<p>been heard of him there. I have had an answer. No
one has seen him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he have got back to Cambridge?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, there is a late train&#8212;quarter-past eleven.&#8221;
&#8220;But so far as you can ascertain he did not take
</p>
<p>it?&#8221;
&#8220;No, he has not been seen.&#8221;
&#8220;What did you do next?&#8221;
&#8220;I wired to Lord Mount-James.&#8221;
&#8220;Why to Lord Mount-James?&#8221;
&#8220;Godfrey is an orphan, and Lord Mount-James
</p>
<p>is his nearest relative&#8212;his uncle, I believe.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed. This throws new light upon the mat-
</p>
<p>ter. Lord Mount-James is one of the richest men in
England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve heard Godfrey say.&#8221;
&#8220;And your friend was closely related?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly
</p>
<p>eighty&#8212;cram full of gout, too. They say he could
chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles. He never
allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an
absolute miser, but it will all come to him right
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard from Lord Mount-James?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;What motive could your friend have in going
</p>
<p>to Lord Mount-James?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, something was worrying him the night
</p>
<p>before, and if it was to do with money it is possi-
ble that he would make for his nearest relative who
had so much of it, though from all I have heard he
would not have much chance of getting it. God-
frey was not fond of the old man. He would not
go if he could help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can soon determine that. If your
friend was going to his relative, Lord Mount-
James, you have then to explain the visit of this
rough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the
agitation that was caused by his coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril Overton pressed his hands to his head. &#8220;I
can make nothing of it,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, I have a clear day, and I shall
be happy to look into the matter,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;I should strongly recommend you to make your
preparations for your match without reference to
this young gentleman. It must, as you say, have
been an overpowering necessity which tore him
away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is
likely to hold him away. Let us step round together
</p>
<p>548</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>to this hotel, and see if the porter can throw any
fresh light upon the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was a past-master in the art
of putting a humble witness at his ease, and very
soon, in the privacy of Godfrey Staunton&#8217;s aban-
doned room, he had extracted all that the porter
had to tell. The visitor of the night before was not a
gentleman, neither was he a working man. He was
simply what the porter described as a &#8220;medium-
looking chap&#8221;; a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale
face, quietly dressed. He seemed himself to be agi-
tated. The porter had observed his hand trembling
when he had held out the note. Godfrey Staunton
had crammed the note into his pocket. Staunton
had not shaken hands with the man in the hall.
They had exchanged a few sentences, of which
the porter had only distinguished the one word
&#8220;time.&#8221; Then they had hurried off in the manner
described. It was just half-past ten by the hall
clock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Holmes, seating himself on
Staunton&#8217;s bed. &#8220;You are the day porter, are you
not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I go off duty at eleven.&#8221;
&#8220;The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; one theatre party came in late. No one
</p>
<p>else.&#8221;
&#8220;Were you on duty all day yesterday?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you take any messages to Mr. Staunton?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; one telegram.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! that&#8217;s interesting. What o&#8217;clock was
</p>
<p>this?&#8221;
&#8220;About six.&#8221;
&#8220;Where was Mr. Staunton when he received
</p>
<p>it?&#8221;
&#8220;Here in his room.&#8221;
&#8220;Were you present when he opened it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; I waited to see if there was an an-
</p>
<p>swer.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, was there?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir. He wrote an answer.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you take it?&#8221;
&#8220;No; he took it himself.&#8221;
&#8220;But he wrote it in your presence?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir. I was standing by the door, and he
</p>
<p>with his back turned at that table. When he had
written it he said, &#8216;All right, porter, I will take this
myself.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he write it with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pen, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Was the telegraphic form one of these on the
</p>
<p>table?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; it was the top one.&#8221;
Holmes rose. Taking the forms he carried them
</p>
<p>over to the window and carefully examined that
which was uppermost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity he did not write in pencil,&#8221; said
he, throwing them down again with a shrug of
disappointment. &#8220;As you have no doubt fre-
quently observed, Watson, the impression usually
goes through&#8212;a fact which has dissolved many
a happy marriage. However, I can find no trace
here. I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote
with a broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly
doubt that we will find some impression upon
this blotting-pad. Ah, yes, surely this is the very
thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and
turned towards us the following hieroglyphic:
</p>
<p>Cyril Overton was much excited. &#8220;Hold it to
the glass!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is unnecessary,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;The pa-
per is thin, and the reverse will give the message.
Here it is.&#8221; He turned it over and we read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that is the tail end of the telegram which
Godfrey Staunton dispatched within a few hours
of his disappearance. There are at least six words
of the message which have escaped us; but what
remains&#8212;&#8216;Stand by us for God&#8217;s sake!&#8217;&#8212;proves
that this young man saw a formidable danger
which approached him, and from which someone
else could protect him. &#8216;Us,&#8217; mark you! Another
person was involved. Who should it be but the
pale-faced, bearded man, who seemed himself in
so nervous a state? What, then, is the connec-
tion between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded
man? And what is the third source from which
each of them sought for help against pressing dan-
ger? Our inquiry has already narrowed down to
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have only to find to whom that telegram
is addressed,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, my dear Watson. Your reflection,
though profound, had already crossed my mind.
But I dare say it may have come to your notice
that if you walk into a post-office and demand to
see the counterfoil of another man&#8217;s message there
</p>
<p>549</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter
</p>
<p>may be some disinclination on the part of the of-
ficials to oblige you. There is so much red tape
in these matters! However, I have no doubt that
with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be at-
tained. Meanwhile, I should like in your presence,
Mr. Overton, to go through these papers which
have been left upon the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were a number of letters, bills, and note-
books, which Holmes turned over and examined
with quick, nervous fingers and darting, penetrat-
ing eyes. &#8220;Nothing here,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;By the
way, I suppose your friend was a healthy young
fellow&#8212;nothing amiss with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sound as a bell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever known him ill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a day. He has been laid up with a hack,
and once he slipped his knee-cap, but that was
nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose.
I should think he may have had some secret trou-
ble. With your assent I will put one or two of
these papers in my pocket, in case they should
bear upon our future inquiry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment! one moment!&#8221; cried a queru-
lous voice, and we looked up to find a queer lit-
tle old man, jerking and twitching in the doorway.
He was dressed in rusty black, with a very broad
brimmed top-hat and a loose white necktie&#8212;the
whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or
of an undertaker&#8217;s mute. Yet, in spite of his shabby
and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp
crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which
commanded attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir, and by what right do you
touch this gentleman&#8217;s papers?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a private detective, and I am endeavour-
ing to explain his disappearance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are, are you? And who instructed
you, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman, Mr. Staunton&#8217;s friend, was re-
ferred to me by Scotland Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Cyril Overton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is you who sent me a telegram. My
name is Lord Mount-James. I came round as
quickly as the Bayswater &#8217;bus would bring me. So
you have instructed a detective?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you prepared to meet the cost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey,
when we find him, will be prepared to do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he is never found, eh? Answer me that!&#8221;
&#8220;In that case no doubt his family&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing of the sort, sir!&#8221; screamed the little
</p>
<p>man. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look to me for a penny&#8212;not a penny!
You understand that, Mr. Detective! I am all the
family that this young man has got, and I tell you
that I am not responsible. If he has any expecta-
tions it is due to the fact that I have never wasted
money, and I do not propose to begin to do so
now. As to those papers with which you are mak-
ing so free, I may tell you that in case there should
be anything of any value among them you will
be held strictly to account for what you do with
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, sir,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;May
I ask in the meanwhile whether you have yourself
any theory to account for this young man&#8217;s disap-
pearance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old
enough to look after himself, and if he is so fool-
ish as to lose himself I entirely refuse to accept the
responsibility of hunting for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite understand your position,&#8221; said
Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t quite understand mine. God-
frey Staunton appears to have been a poor man. If
he has been kidnapped it could not have been for
anything which he himself possesses. The fame
of your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-
James, and it is entirely possible that a gang of
thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain
from him some information as to your house, your
habits, and your treasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The face of our unpleasant little visitor turned
as white as his neckcloth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, sir, what an idea! I never thought
of such villainy! What inhuman rogues there are
in the world! But Godfrey is a fine lad&#8212;a staunch
lad. Nothing would induce him to give his old un-
cle away. I&#8217;ll have the plate moved over to the bank
this evening. In the meantime spare no pains, Mr.
Detective! I beg you to leave no stone unturned to
bring him safely back. As to money, well, so far as
a fiver, or even a tenner, goes, you can always look
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even in his chastened frame of mind the noble
miser could give us no information which could
help us, for he knew little of the private life of his
nephew. Our only clue lay in the truncated tele-
gram, and with a copy of this in his hand Holmes
set forth to find a second link for his chain. We
had shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton
had gone to consult with the other members of his
team over the misfortune which had befallen them.
</p>
<p>550</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>There was a telegraph-office at a short distance
from the hotel. We halted outside it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth trying, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Of
course, with a warrant we could demand to see the
counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage
yet. I don&#8217;t suppose they remember faces in so
busy a place. Let us venture it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to trouble you,&#8221; said he, in his
blandest manner, to the young woman behind the
grating; &#8220;there is some small mistake about a tele-
gram I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and
I very much fear that I must have omitted to put
my name at the end. Could you tell me if this was
so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young woman turned over a sheaf of coun-
terfoils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What o&#8217;clock was it?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;A little after six.&#8221;
&#8220;Whom was it to?&#8221;
Holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at
</p>
<p>me. &#8220;The last words in it were &#8216;for God&#8217;s sake,&#8217; &#8221;
he whispered, confidentially; &#8220;I am very anxious
at getting no answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young woman separated one of the forms.
&#8220;This is it. There is no name,&#8221; said she, smooth-
</p>
<p>ing it out upon the counter.
&#8220;Then that, of course, accounts for my getting
</p>
<p>no answer,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Dear me, how very
stupid of me, to be sure! Good morning, miss, and
many thanks for having relieved my mind.&#8221; He
chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found
ourselves in the street once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;We progress, my dear Watson, we progress. I
</p>
<p>had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse
of that telegram, but I could hardly hope to suc-
ceed the very first time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what have you gained?&#8221;
&#8220;A starting-point for our investigation.&#8221; He
</p>
<p>hailed a cab. &#8220;King&#8217;s Cross Station,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;We have a journey, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; I think we must run down to Cambridge
</p>
<p>together. All the indications seem to me to point
in that direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; I asked, as we rattled up Gray&#8217;s Inn
Road, &#8220;have you any suspicion yet as to the cause
of the disappearance? I don&#8217;t think that among all
our cases I have known one where the motives are
more obscure. Surely you don&#8217;t really imagine that
he may be kidnapped in order to give information
against his wealthy uncle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not
appeal to me as a very probable explanation. It
struck me, however, as being the one which was
most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant
old person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly did that. But what are your alter-
natives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could mention several. You must admit
that it is curious and suggestive that this incident
should occur on the eve of this important match,
and should involve the only man whose presence
seems essential to the success of the side. It may,
of course, be coincidence, but it is interesting. Am-
ateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of
outside betting goes on among the public, and it
is possible that it might be worth someone&#8217;s while
to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at
a race-horse. There is one explanation. A second
very obvious one is that this young man really is
the heir of a great property, however modest his
means may at present be, and it is not impossible
that a plot to hold him for ransom might be con-
cocted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These theories take no account of the tele-
gram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true, Watson. The telegram still remains
the only solid thing with which we have to deal,
and we must not permit our attention to wander
away from it. It is to gain light upon the purpose
of this telegram that we are now upon our way
to Cambridge. The path of our investigation is
at present obscure, but I shall be very much sur-
prised if before evening we have not cleared it up
or made a considerable advance along it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was already dark when we reached the old
University city. Holmes took a cab at the station,
and ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr.
Leslie Armstrong. A few minutes later we had
stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thor-
oughfare. We were shown in, and after a long wait
were at last admitted into the consulting-room,
where we found the doctor seated behind his ta-
ble.
</p>
<p>It argues the degree in which I had lost touch
with my profession that the name of Leslie Arm-
strong was unknown to me. Now I am aware that
he is not only one of the heads of the medical
school of the University, but a thinker of European
reputation in more than one branch of science.
Yet even without knowing his brilliant record one
could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance
at the man, the square, massive face, the brood-
ing eyes under the thatched brows, and the gran-
ite moulding of the inflexible jaw. A man of deep
</p>
<p>551</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter
</p>
<p>character, a man with an alert mind, grim, ascetic,
self-contained, formidable&#8212;so I read Dr. Leslie
Armstrong. He held my friend&#8217;s card in his hand,
and he looked up with no very pleased expression
upon his dour features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
and I am aware of your profession, one of which I
by no means approve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that, doctor, you will find yourself in agree-
ment with every criminal in the country,&#8221; said my
friend, quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as your efforts are directed towards the
suppression of crime, sir, they must have the sup-
port of every reasonable member of the commu-
nity, though I cannot doubt that the official ma-
chinery is amply sufficient for the purpose. Where
your calling is more open to criticism is when you
pry into the secrets of private individuals, when
you rake up family matters which are better hid-
den, and when you incidentally waste the time of
men who are more busy than yourself. At the
present moment, for example, I should be writing
a treatise instead of conversing with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, doctor; and yet the conversation
may prove more important than the treatise. In-
cidentally I may tell you that we are doing the re-
verse of what you very justly blame, and that we
are endeavouring to prevent anything like public
exposure of private matters which must necessar-
ily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands
of the official police. You may look upon me sim-
ply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the
regular forces of the country. I have come to ask
you about Mr. Godfrey Staunton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know him, do you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is an intimate friend of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are aware that he has disappeared?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; There was no change of expres-
sion in the rugged features of the doctor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He left his hotel last night. He has not been
heard of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt he will return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow is the &#8217;Varsity football match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no sympathy with these childish
games. The young man&#8217;s fate interests me deeply,
since I know him and like him. The football match
does not come within my horizon at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I claim your sympathy, then, in my investiga-
tion of Mr. Staunton&#8217;s fate. Do you know where he
is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;You have not seen him since yesterday?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I have not.&#8221;
&#8220;Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man?&#8221;
&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you ever know him ill?&#8221;
&#8220;Never.&#8221;
Holmes popped a sheet of paper before the
</p>
<p>doctor&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Then perhaps you will explain
this receipted bill for thirteen guineas, paid by Mr.
Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Arm-
strong of Cambridge. I picked it out from among
the papers upon his desk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor flushed with anger.
&#8220;I do not feel that there is any reason why I
</p>
<p>should render an explanation to you, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
Holmes replaced the bill in his note-book. &#8220;If
</p>
<p>you prefer a public explanation it must come
sooner or later,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I have already told you
that I can hush up that which others will be bound
to publish, and you would really be wiser to take
me into your complete confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in London?&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me, dear me; the post-office again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sighed, wearily. &#8220;A most urgent telegram
was dispatched to you from London by Godfrey
Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening&#8212;a tele-
gram which is undoubtedly associated with his
disappearance&#8212;and yet you have not had it. It
is most culpable. I shall certainly go down to the
office here and register a complaint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Armstrong sprang up from behind
his desk, and his dark face was crimson with fury.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;You can tell your employer, Lord Mount-
James, that I do not wish to have anything to do
either with him or with his agents. No, sir, not an-
other word!&#8221; He rang the bell furiously. &#8220;John,
show these gentlemen out!&#8221; A pompous butler
ushered us severely to the door, and we found our-
selves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of en-
ergy and character,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I have not seen a
man who, if he turned his talents that way, was
more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustri-
ous Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here
we are, stranded and friendless in this inhospitable
town, which we cannot leave without abandoning
our case. This little inn just opposite Armstrong&#8217;s
house is singularly adapted to our needs. If you
</p>
<p>552</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>would engage a front room and purchase the nec-
essaries for the night, I may have time to make a
few inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>These few inquiries proved, however, to be a
more lengthy proceeding than Holmes had imag-
ined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly
nine o&#8217;clock. He was pale and dejected, stained
with dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue.
A cold supper was ready upon the table, and when
his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was
ready to take that half comic and wholly philo-
sophic view which was natural to him when his
affairs were going awry. The sound of carriage
wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the
window. A brougham and pair of greys under the
glare of a gas-lamp stood before the doctor&#8217;s door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been out three hours,&#8221; said Holmes;
&#8220;started at half-past six, and here it is back again.
That gives a radius of ten or twelve miles, and he
does it once, or sometimes twice, a day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No unusual thing for a doctor in practice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Armstrong is not really a doctor in prac-
tice. He is a lecturer and a consultant, but he does
not care for general practice, which distracts him
from his literary work. Why, then, does he make
these long journeys, which must be exceedingly
irksome to him, and who is it that he visits?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His coachman&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to
him that I first applied? I do not know whether it
came from his own innate depravity or from the
promptings of his master, but he was rude enough
to set a dog at me. Neither dog nor man liked
the look of my stick, however, and the matter fell
through. Relations were strained after that, and
further inquiries out of the question. All that I
have learned I got from a friendly native in the
yard of our own inn. It was he who told me of the
doctor&#8217;s habits and of his daily journey. At that in-
stant, to give point to his words, the carriage came
round to the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you not follow it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! You are scintillating this
evening. The idea did cross my mind. There is, as
you may have observed, a bicycle shop next to our
inn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was
able to get started before the carriage was quite out
of sight. I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping
at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I
followed its lights until we were clear of the town.
We had got well out on the country road when a
somewhat mortifying incident occurred. The car-
riage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly
</p>
<p>back to where I had also halted, and told me in an
excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road
was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not
impede the passage of my bicycle. Nothing could
have been more admirable than his way of putting
it. I at once rode past the carriage, and, keeping to
the main road, I went on for a few miles, and then
halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage
passed. There was no sign of it, however, and so
it became evident that it had turned down one of
several side roads which I had observed. I rode
back, but again saw nothing of the carriage, and
now, as you perceive, it has returned after me. Of
course, I had at the outset no particular reason to
connect these journeys with the disappearance of
Godfrey Staunton, and was only inclined to inves-
tigate them on the general grounds that everything
which concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of in-
terest to us; but, now that I find he keeps so keen
a look-out upon anyone who may follow him on
these excursions, the affair appears more impor-
tant, and I shall not be satisfied until I have made
the matter clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can follow him to-morrow.&#8221;
&#8220;Can we? It is not so easy as you seem to think.
</p>
<p>You are not familiar with Cambridgeshire scenery,
are you? It does not lend itself to concealment.
All this country that I passed over to-night is as
flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the
man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly
showed to-night. I have wired to Overton to let
us know any fresh London developments at this
address, and in the meantime we can only con-
centrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose
name the obliging young lady at the office allowed
me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton&#8217;s ur-
gent message. He knows where the young man
is&#8212;to that I&#8217;ll swear&#8212;and if he knows, then it
must be our own fault if we cannot manage to
know also. At present it must be admitted that
the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are
aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game
in that condition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And yet the next day brought us no nearer to
the solution of the mystery. A note was handed in
after breakfast, which Holmes passed across to me
with a smile.
</p>
<p>Sir [it ran]:
I can assure you that you are wasting
</p>
<p>your time in dogging my movements.
I have, as you discovered last night, a
window at the back of my brougham,
and if you desire a twenty-mile ride
which will lead you to the spot from
</p>
<p>553</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter
</p>
<p>which you started, you have only to
follow me. Meanwhile, I can inform
you that no spying upon me can in any
way help Mr. Godfrey Staunton, and I
am convinced that the best service you
can do to that gentleman is to return at
once to London and to report to your
employer that you are unable to trace
him. Your time in Cambridge will cer-
tainly be wasted.
</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
Leslie Armstrong.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doc-
tor,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Well, well, he excites my cu-
riosity, and I must really know more before I leave
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His carriage is at his door now,&#8221; said I. &#8220;There
he is stepping into it. I saw him glance up at our
window as he did so. Suppose I try my luck upon
the bicycle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, my dear Watson! With all respect for
your natural acumen I do not think that you are
quite a match for the worthy doctor. I think that
possibly I can attain our end by some independent
explorations of my own. I am afraid that I must
leave you to your own devices, as the appearance
of two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy country-
side might excite more gossip than I care for. No
doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in
this venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more
favourable report to you before evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once more, however, my friend was destined
to be disappointed. He came back at night weary
and unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a blank day, Watson. Having
got the doctor&#8217;s general direction, I spent the
day in visiting all the villages upon that side of
Cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans
and other local news agencies. I have covered
some ground: Chesterton, Histon, Waterbeach,
and Oakington have each been explored and have
each proved disappointing. The daily appearance
of a brougham and pair could hardly have been
overlooked in such Sleepy Hollows. The doctor
has scored once more. Is there a telegram for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I opened it. Here it is:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon,
Trinity College.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, it is clear enough. It is from our friend
</p>
<p>Overton, and is in answer to a question from me.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon,
and then I have no doubt that our luck will turn.
By the way, is there any news of the match?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the local evening paper has an excellent
account in its last edition. Oxford won by a goal
and two tries. The last sentences of the description
say:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The defeat of the Light Blues may be
entirely attributed to the unfortunate ab-
sence of the crack International, Godfrey
Staunton, whose want was felt at every in-
stant of the game. The lack of combination
in the three-quarter line and their weak-
ness both in attack and defence more than
neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-
working pack.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then our friend Overton&#8217;s forebodings have been
justified,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Personally I am in agree-
ment with Dr. Armstrong, and football does not
come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night,
Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an
eventful day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes
next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his
tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated that instru-
ment with the single weakness of his nature, and
I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his
hand. He laughed at my expression of dismay, and
laid it upon the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for
alarm. It is not upon this occasion the instrument
of evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which
will unlock our mystery. On this syringe I base
all my hopes. I have just returned from a small
scouting expedition and everything is favourable.
Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get
upon Dr. Armstrong&#8217;s trail to-day, and once on it I
will not stop for rest or food until I run him to his
burrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we had best carry our
breakfast with us, for he is making an early start.
His carriage is at the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. Let him go. He will be clever if
he can drive where I cannot follow him. When you
have finished come downstairs with me, and I will
introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent
specialist in the work that lies before us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we descended I followed Holmes into
the stable yard, where he opened the door of a
loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared, white-
and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a
foxhound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me introduce you to Pompey,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Pompey is the pride of the local draghounds,
</p>
<p>554</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>no very great flier, as his build will show, but a
staunch hound on a scent. Well, Pompey, you may
not be fast, but I expect you will be too fast for
a couple of middle-aged London gentlemen, so I
will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash
to your collar. Now, boy, come along, and show
what you can do.&#8221; He led him across to the doc-
tor&#8217;s door. The dog sniffed round for an instant,
and then with a shrill whine of excitement started
off down the street, tugging at his leash in his ef-
forts to go faster. In half an hour, we were clear of
the town and hastening down a country road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done, Holmes?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A threadbare and venerable device, but useful
upon occasion. I walked into the doctor&#8217;s yard this
morning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over
the hind wheel. A draghound will follow aniseed
from here to John o&#8217; Groat&#8217;s, and our friend Arm-
strong would have to drive through the Cam be-
fore he would shake Pompey off his trail. Oh, the
cunning rascal! This is how he gave me the slip
the other night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dog had suddenly turned out of the main
road into a grass-grown lane. Half a mile farther
this opened into another broad road, and the trail
turned hard to the right in the direction of the
town, which we had just quitted. The road took
a sweep to the south of the town and continued in
the opposite direction to that in which we started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This de&#180;tour has been entirely for our benefit,
then?&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;No wonder that my in-
quiries among those villages led to nothing. The
doctor has certainly played the game for all it is
worth, and one would like to know the reason for
such elaborate deception. This should be the vil-
lage of Trumpington to the right of us. And, by
Jove! here is the brougham coming round the cor-
ner. Quick, Watson, quick, or we are done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sprang through a gate into a field, dragging
the reluctant Pompey after him. We had hardly got
under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage
rattled past. I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong
within, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his
hands, the very image of distress. I could tell by
my companion&#8217;s graver face that he also had seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear there is some dark ending to our quest,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;It cannot be long before we know it.
Come, Pompey! Ah, it is the cottage in the field!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that we had reached
the end of our journey. Pompey ran about and
whined eagerly outside the gate where the marks
of the brougham&#8217;s wheels were still to be seen. A
footpath led across to the lonely cottage. Holmes
</p>
<p>tied the dog to the hedge, and we hastened on-
wards. My friend knocked at the little rustic door,
and knocked again without response. And yet the
cottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to
our ears&#8212;a kind of drone of misery and despair,
which was indescribably melancholy. Holmes
paused irresolute, and then he glanced back at the
road which we had just traversed. A brougham
was coming down it, and there could be no mis-
taking those grey horses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, the doctor is coming back!&#8221; cried
Holmes. &#8220;That settles it. We are bound to see what
it means before he comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened the door and we stepped into the
hall. The droning sound swelled louder upon our
ears until it became one long, deep wail of distress.
It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up and I
followed him. He pushed open a half-closed door
and we both stood appalled at the sight before us.
</p>
<p>A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead
upon the bed. Her calm, pale face, with dim,
wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid
a great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the
bed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in
the clothes, was a young man, whose frame was
racked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bit-
ter grief that he never looked up until Holmes&#8217;s
hand was on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, yes; I am&#8212;but you are too late. She is
</p>
<p>dead.&#8221;
The man was so dazed that he could not
</p>
<p>be made to understand that we were anything
but doctors who had been sent to his assistance.
Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of
consolation, and to explain the alarm which had
been caused to his friends by his sudden disap-
pearance, when there was a step upon the stairs,
and there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of
Dr. Armstrong at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have attained
your end, and have certainly chosen a particularly
delicate moment for your intrusion. I would not
brawl in the presence of death, but I can assure
you that if I were a younger man your monstrous
conduct would not pass with impunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a
little at cross-purposes,&#8221; said my friend, with dig-
nity. &#8220;If you could step downstairs with us we may
each be able to give some light to the other upon
this miserable affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute later the grim doctor and ourselves
were in the sitting-room below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir?&#8221; said he.
