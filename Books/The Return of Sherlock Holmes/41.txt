<p>e have had some dramatic entrances
and exits upon our small stage at Baker
Street, but I cannot recollect anything
more sudden and startling than the first
</p>
<p>appearance of Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D.,
etc. His card, which seemed too small to carry the
weight of his academic distinctions, preceded him
by a few seconds, and then he entered himself&#8212;so
large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was
the very embodiment of self-possession and solid-
ity. And yet his first action when the door had
closed behind him was to stagger against the ta-
ble, whence he slipped down upon the floor, and
there was that majestic figure prostrate and insen-
sible upon our bearskin hearthrug.
</p>
<p>We had sprung to our feet, and for a few mo-
ments we stared in silent amazement at this pon-
derous piece of wreckage, which told of some sud-
den and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life.
Then Holmes hurried with a cushion for his head
and I with brandy for his lips. The heavy white
face was seamed with lines of trouble, the hang-
ing pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in
colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the
corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. Collar
and shirt bore the grime of a long journey, and the
hair bristled unkempt from the well-shaped head.
It was a sorely-stricken man who lay before us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Watson?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolute exhaustion&#8212;possibly mere hunger
and fatigue,&#8221; said I, with my finger on the thready
pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and
small.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Return ticket from Mackleton, in the North
of England,&#8221; said Holmes, drawing it from the
watch-pocket. &#8220;It is not twelve o&#8217;clock yet. He
has certainly been an early starter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and
now a pair of vacant, grey eyes looked up at us.
An instant later the man had scrambled on to his
feet, his face crimson with shame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive this weakness, Mr. Holmes; I have
been a little overwrought. Thank you, if I might
have a glass of milk and a biscuit I have no doubt
that I should be better. I came personally, Mr.
Holmes, in order to ensure that you would return
with me. I feared that no telegram would convince
you of the absolute urgency of the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are quite restored&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite well again. I cannot imagine how
I came to be so weak. I wish you, Mr. Holmes, to
come to Mackleton with me by the next train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My colleague, Dr. Watson, could tell you that
we are very busy at present. I am retained in
this case of the Ferrers Documents, and the Aber-
gavenny murder is coming up for trial. Only a
very important issue could call me from London
at present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Important!&#8221; Our visitor threw up his hands.
&#8220;Have you heard nothing of the abduction of the
only son of the Duke of Holdernesse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! the late Cabinet Minister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. We had tried to keep it out of the pa-
pers, but there was some rumour in the Globe last
night. I thought it might have reached your ears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shot out his long, thin arm and picked
out Volume &#8220;H&#8221; in his encyclopaedia of reference.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Holdernesse, 6th Duke, K.G., P.C.&#8217;&#8212;half the
alphabet! &#8216;Baron Beverley, Earl of Carston&#8217;&#8212;dear
me, what a list! &#8216;Lord Lieutenant of Hallamshire
since 1900. Married Edith, daughter of Sir Charles
Appledore, 1888. Heir and only child, Lord Saltire.
Owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres.
Minerals in Lancashire and Wales. Address: Carl-
ton House Terrace; Holdernesse Hall, Hallamshire;
Carston Castle, Bangor, Wales. Lord of the Ad-
miralty, 1872; Chief Secretary of State for&#8212;&#8217; Well,
well, this man is certainly one of the greatest sub-
jects of the Crown!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest and perhaps the wealthiest. I am
aware, Mr. Holmes, that you take a very high line
in professional matters, and that you are prepared
to work for the work&#8217;s sake. I may tell you, how-
ever, that his Grace has already intimated that a
cheque for five thousand pounds will be handed
over to the person who can tell him where his son
is, and another thousand to him who can name the
man, or men, who have taken him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a princely offer,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Wat-
son, I think that we shall accompany Dr. Huxtable
back to the North of England. And now, Dr.
Huxtable, when you have consumed that milk you
will kindly tell me what has happened, when it
happened, how it happened, and, finally, what Dr.
Thorneycroft Huxtable, of the Priory School, near
Mackleton, has to do with the matter, and why
he comes three days after an event&#8212;the state of
your chin gives the date&#8212;to ask for my humble
services.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor had consumed his milk and bis-
cuits. The light had come back to his eyes and the
colour to his cheeks as he set himself with great
vigour and lucidity to explain the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must inform you, gentlemen, that the Pri-
ory is a preparatory school, of which I am the
</p>
<p>473</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>founder and principal. &#8216;Huxtable&#8217;s Sidelights on Ho-
race&#8217; may possibly recall my name to your mem-
ories. The Priory is, without exception, the best
and most select preparatory school in England.
Lord Leverstoke, the Earl of Blackwater, Sir Cath-
cart Soames&#8212;they all have entrusted their sons to
me. But I felt that my school had reached its zenith
when, three weeks ago, the Duke of Holdernesse
sent Mr. James Wilder, his secretary, with the inti-
mation that young Lord Saltire, ten years old, his
only son and heir, was about to be committed to
my charge. Little did I think that this would be
the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my
life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the be-
ginning of the summer term. He was a charm-
ing youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may
tell you&#8212;I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-
confidences are absurd in such a case&#8212;that he was
not entirely happy at home. It is an open secret
that the Duke&#8217;s married life had not been a peace-
ful one, and the matter had ended in a separation
by mutual consent, the Duchess taking up her res-
idence in the South of France. This had occurred
very shortly before, and the boy&#8217;s sympathies are
known to have been strongly with his mother. He
moped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall,
and it was for this reason that the Duke desired to
send him to my establishment. In a fortnight the
boy was quite at home with us, and was appar-
ently absolutely happy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was last seen on the night of May
13th&#8212;that is, the night of last Monday. His room
was on the second floor, and was approached
through another larger room in which two boys
were sleeping. These boys saw and heard nothing,
so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass
out that way. His window was open, and there is
a stout ivy plant leading to the ground. We could
trace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this is
the only possible exit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His absence was discovered at seven o&#8217;clock
on Tuesday morning. His bed had been slept
in. He had dressed himself fully before going off
in his usual school suit of black Eton jacket and
dark grey trousers. There were no signs that any-
one had entered the room, and it is quite certain
that anything in the nature of cries, or a struggle,
would have been heard, since Caunter, the elder
boy in the inner room, is a very light sleeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Lord Saltire&#8217;s disappearance was dis-
covered I at once called a roll of the whole es-
tablishment, boys, masters, and servants. It was
then that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not
</p>
<p>been alone in his flight. Heidegger, the German
master, was missing. His room was on the second
floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the
same way as Lord Saltire&#8217;s. His bed had also been
slept in; but he had apparently gone away partly
dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the
floor. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the
ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where
he had landed on the lawn. His bicycle was kept
in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was
gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had been with me for two years, and came
with the best references; but he was a silent, mo-
rose man, not very popular either with masters or
boys. No trace could be found of the fugitives,
and now on Thursday morning we are as ignorant
as we were on Tuesday. Inquiry was, of course,
made at once at Holdernesse Hall. It is only a few
miles away, and we imagined that in some sudden
attack of home-sickness he had gone back to his
father; but nothing had been heard of him. The
Duke is greatly agitated&#8212;and as to me, you have
seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to
which the suspense and the responsibility have re-
duced me. Mr. Holmes, if ever you put forward
your full powers, I implore you to do so now, for
never in your life could you have a case which is
more worthy of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had listened with the utmost
intentness to the statement of the unhappy school-
master. His drawn brows and the deep furrow be-
tween them showed that he needed no exhorta-
tion to concentrate all his attention upon a prob-
lem which, apart from the tremendous interests
involved, must appeal so directly to his love of
the complex and the unusual. He now drew out
his note-book and jotted down one or two memo-
randa.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been very remiss in not coming to
me sooner,&#8221; said he, severely. &#8220;You start me on
my investigation with a very serious handicap. It
is inconceivable, for example, that this ivy and this
lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert ob-
server.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not to blame, Mr. Holmes. His Grace
was extremely desirous to avoid all public scan-
dal. He was afraid of his family unhappiness being
dragged before the world. He has a deep horror of
anything of the kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there has been some official investiga-
tion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing.
An apparent clue was at once obtained, since a boy
and a young man were reported to have been seen
</p>
<p>474</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>leaving a neighbouring station by an early train.
Only last night we had news that the couple had
been hunted down in Liverpool, and they prove
to have no connection whatever with the matter in
hand. Then it was that in my despair and disap-
pointment, after a sleepless night, I came straight
to you by the early train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the local investigation was relaxed
while this false clue was being followed up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was entirely dropped.&#8221;
&#8220;So that three days have been wasted. The af-
</p>
<p>fair has been most deplorably handled.&#8221;
&#8220;I feel it, and admit it.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet the problem should be capable of ul-
</p>
<p>timate solution. I shall be very happy to look into
it. Have you been able to trace any connection be-
tween the missing boy and this German master?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all.&#8221;
&#8220;Was he in the master&#8217;s class?&#8221;
&#8220;No; he never exchanged a word with him so
</p>
<p>far as I know.&#8221;
&#8220;That is certainly very singular. Had the boy a
</p>
<p>bicycle?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Was any other bicycle missing?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Is that certain?&#8221;
&#8220;Quite.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, now, you do not mean to seriously sug-
</p>
<p>gest that this German rode off upon a bicycle in the
dead of the night bearing the boy in his arms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;Then what is the theory in your mind?&#8221;
&#8220;The bicycle may have been a blind. It may
</p>
<p>have been hidden somewhere and the pair gone
off on foot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so; but it seems rather an absurd blind,
does it not? Were there other bicycles in this
shed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Several.&#8221;
&#8220;Would he not have hidden a couple he de-
</p>
<p>sired to give the idea that they had gone off upon
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he would.&#8221;
&#8220;Of course he would. The blind theory won&#8217;t
</p>
<p>do. But the incident is an admirable starting-point
for an investigation. After all, a bicycle is not an
easy thing to conceal or to destroy. One other ques-
tion. Did anyone call to see the boy on the day
before he disappeared?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get any letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; one letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From his father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you open the boys&#8217; letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know it was from the father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The coat of arms was on the envelope, and it
was addressed in the Duke&#8217;s peculiar stiff hand.
Besides, the Duke remembers having written.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When had he a letter before that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for several days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had he ever one from France?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; never.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see the point of my questions, of course.
Either the boy was carried off by force or he went
of his own free will. In the latter case you would
expect that some prompting from outside would
be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing.
If he has had no visitors, that prompting must have
come in letters. Hence I try to find out who were
his correspondents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear I cannot help you much. His only corre-
spondent, so far as I know, was his own father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wrote to him on the very day of his dis-
appearance. Were the relations between father and
son very friendly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His Grace is never very friendly with any-
one. He is completely immersed in large public
questions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary
emotions. But he was always kind to the boy in his
own way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the sympathies of the latter were with the
mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duke, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, no!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how could you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had some confidential talks with Mr.
James Wilder, his Grace&#8217;s secretary. It was he who
gave me the information about Lord Saltire&#8217;s feel-
ings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. By the way, that last letter of the
Duke&#8217;s&#8212;was it found in the boy&#8217;s room after he
was gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>475</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he had taken it with him. I think, Mr.
Holmes, it is time that we were leaving for Eu-
ston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will order a four-wheeler. In a quarter of an
hour we shall be at your service. If you are tele-
graphing home, Mr. Huxtable, it would be well to
allow the people in your neighbourhood to imag-
ine that the inquiry is still going on in Liverpool,
or wherever else that red herring led your pack. In
the meantime I will do a little quiet work at your
own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold
but that two old hounds like Watson and myself
may get a sniff of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening found us in the cold, bracing
atmosphere of the Peak country, in which Dr.
Huxtable&#8217;s famous school is situated. It was al-
ready dark when we reached it. A card was lying
on the hall table, and the butler whispered some-
thing to his master, who turned to us with agita-
tion in every heavy feature.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duke is here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The Duke and
Mr. Wilder are in the study. Come, gentlemen, and
I will introduce you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was, of course, familiar with the pictures of
the famous statesman, but the man himself was
very different from his representation. He was
a tall and stately person, scrupulously dressed,
with a drawn, thin face, and a nose which was
grotesquely curved and long. His complexion was
of a dead pallor, which was more startling by con-
trast with a long, dwindling beard of vivid red,
which flowed down over his white waistcoat, with
his watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. Such
was the stately presence who looked stonily at us
from the centre of Dr. Huxtable&#8217;s hearthrug. Be-
side him stood a very young man, whom I un-
derstood to be Wilder, the private secretary. He
was small, nervous, alert, with intelligent, light-
blue eyes and mobile features. It was he who at
once, in an incisive and positive tone, opened the
conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I called this morning, Dr. Huxtable, too late to
prevent you from starting for London. I learned
that your object was to invite Mr. Sherlock Holmes
to undertake the conduct of this case. His Grace
is surprised, Dr. Huxtable, that you should have
taken such a step without consulting him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I learned that the police had failed&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His Grace is by no means convinced that the
police have failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, Mr. Wilder&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are well aware, Dr. Huxtable, that his
Grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public
</p>
<p>scandal. He prefers to take as few people as possi-
ble into his confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter can be easily remedied,&#8221; said the
brow-beaten doctor; &#8220;Mr. Sherlock Holmes can re-
turn to London by the morning train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that, Doctor, hardly that,&#8221; said
Holmes, in his blandest voice. &#8220;This northern air
is invigorating and pleasant, so I propose to spend
a few days upon your moors, and to occupy my
mind as best I may. Whether I have the shelter of
your roof or of the village inn is, of course, for you
to decide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see that the unfortunate doctor was in
the last stage of indecision, from which he was
rescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the red-
bearded Duke, which boomed out like a dinner-
gong.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Mr. Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, that you
would have done wisely to consult me. But since
Mr. Holmes has already been taken into your con-
fidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should
not avail ourselves of his services. Far from go-
ing to the inn, Mr. Holmes, I should be pleased if
you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse
Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank your Grace. For the purposes of my
investigation I think that it would be wiser for me
to remain at the scene of the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you like, Mr. Holmes. Any information
which Mr. Wilder or I can give you is, of course, at
your disposal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will probably be necessary for me to see you
at the Hall,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I would only ask you
now, sir, whether you have formed any explana-
tion in your own mind as to the mysterious disap-
pearance of your son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I have not.&#8221;
&#8220;Excuse me if I allude to that which is painful
</p>
<p>to you, but I have no alternative. Do you think that
the Duchess had anything to do with the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The great Minister showed perceptible hesita-
tion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think so,&#8221; he said, at last.
&#8220;The other most obvious explanation is that the
</p>
<p>child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levy-
ing ransom. You have not had any demand of the
sort?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;One more question, your Grace. I understand
</p>
<p>that you wrote to your son upon the day when this
incident occurred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I wrote upon the day before.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly. But he received it on that day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>476</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;Was there anything in your letter which might
</p>
<p>have unbalanced him or induced him to take such
a step?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you post that letter yourself?&#8221;
The nobleman&#8217;s reply was interrupted by his
</p>
<p>secretary, who broke in with some heat.
&#8220;His Grace is not in the habit of posting letters
</p>
<p>himself,&#8221; said he. &#8220;This letter was laid with others
upon the study table, and I myself put them in the
post-bag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure this one was among them?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; I observed it.&#8221;
&#8220;How many letters did your Grace write that
</p>
<p>day?&#8221;
&#8220;Twenty or thirty. I have a large correspon-
</p>
<p>dence. But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?&#8221;
&#8220;Not entirely,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;For my own part,&#8221; the Duke continued, &#8220;I
</p>
<p>have advised the police to turn their attention to
the South of France. I have already said that I
do not believe that the Duchess would encourage
so monstrous an action, but the lad had the most
wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he
may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this
German. I think, Dr. Huxtable, that we will now
return to the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could see that there were other questions
which Holmes would have wished to put; but the
nobleman&#8217;s abrupt manner showed that the inter-
view was at an end. It was evident that to his
intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his
intimate family affairs with a stranger was most
abhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh ques-
tion would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly
shadowed corners of his ducal history.
</p>
<p>When the nobleman and his secretary had left,
my friend flung himself at once with characteristic
eagerness into the investigation.
</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s chamber was carefully examined,
and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction
that it was only through the window that he could
have escaped. The German master&#8217;s room and ef-
fects gave no further clue. In his case a trailer
of ivy had given way under his weight, and we
saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn
where his heels had come down. That one dint in
the short green grass was the only material witness
left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes left the house alone, and only
returned after eleven. He had obtained a large
</p>
<p>ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he
brought into my room, where he laid it out on the
bed, and, having balanced the lamp in the middle
of it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to
point out objects of interest with the reeking amber
of his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This case grows upon me, Watson,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There are decidedly some points of interest in
connection with it. In this early stage I want you
to realize those geographical features which may
have a good deal to do with our investigation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this map. This dark square is the Pri-
ory School. I&#8217;ll put a pin in it. Now, this line is the
main road. You see that it runs east and west past
the school, and you see also that there is no side
road for a mile either way. If these two folk passed
away by road it was this road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;By a singular and happy chance we are able to
</p>
<p>some extent to check what passed along this road
during the night in question. At this point, where
my pipe is now resting, a country constable was
on duty from twelve to six. It is, as you perceive,
the first cross road on the east side. This man de-
clares that he was not absent from his post for an
instant, and he is positive that neither boy nor man
could have gone that way unseen. I have spoken
with this policeman to-night, and he appears to me
to be a perfectly reliable person. That blocks this
end. We have now to deal with the other. There
is an inn here, the Red Bull, the landlady of which
was ill. She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor,
but he did not arrive until morning, being absent
</p>
<p>477</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>at another case. The people at the inn were alert
all night, awaiting his coming, and one or other of
them seems to have continually had an eye upon
the road. They declare that no one passed. If their
evidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to
be able to block the west, and also to be able to say
that the fugitives did not use the road at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the bicycle?&#8221; I objected.
&#8220;Quite so. We will come to the bicycle
</p>
<p>presently. To continue our reasoning: if these peo-
ple did not go by the road, they must have tra-
versed the country to the north of the house or
to the south of the house. That is certain. Let us
weigh the one against the other. On the south of
the house is, as you perceive, a large district of
arable land, cut up into small fields, with stone
walls between them. There, I admit that a bicycle
is impossible. We can dismiss the idea. We turn to
the country on the north. Here there lies a grove of
trees, marked as the &#8216;Ragged Shaw,&#8217; and on the far-
ther side stretches a great rolling moor, Lower Gill
Moor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradu-
ally upwards. Here, at one side of this wilderness,
is Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by road, but only six
across the moor. It is a peculiarly desolate plain. A
few moor farmers have small holdings, where they
rear sheep and cattle. Except these, the plover and
the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come
to the Chesterfield high road. There is a church
there, you see, a few cottages, and an inn. Beyond
that the hills become precipitous. Surely it is here
to the north that our quest must lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the bicycle?&#8221; I persisted.
&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said Holmes, impatiently. &#8220;A
</p>
<p>good cyclist does not need a high road. The moor
is intersected with paths and the moon was at the
full. Halloa! what is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an agitated knock at the door, and an
instant afterwards Dr. Huxtable was in the room.
In his hand he held a blue cricket-cap, with a white
chevron on the peak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last we have a clue!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Thank
Heaven! at last we are on the dear boy&#8217;s track!
It is his cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was it found?&#8221;
&#8220;In the van of the gipsies who camped on the
</p>
<p>moor. They left on Tuesday. To-day the police
traced them down and examined their caravan.
This was found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do they account for it?&#8221;
&#8220;They shuffled and lied&#8212;said that they found
</p>
<p>it on the moor on Tuesday morning. They know
where he is, the rascals! Thank goodness, they are
</p>
<p>all safe under lock and key. Either the fear of the
law or the Duke&#8217;s purse will certainly get out of
them all that they know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, so good,&#8221; said Holmes, when the doc-
tor had at last left the room. &#8220;It at least bears out
the theory that it is on the side of the Lower Gill
Moor that we must hope for results. The police
have really done nothing locally, save the arrest
of these gipsies. Look here, Watson! There is a
watercourse across the moor. You see it marked
here in the map. In some parts it widens into a
morass. This is particularly so in the region be-
tween Holdernesse Hall and the school. It is vain
to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather;
but at that point there is certainly a chance of some
record being left. I will call you early to-morrow
morning, and you and I will try if we can throw
some little light upon the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The day was just breaking when I woke to find
the long, thin form of Holmes by my bedside.
He was fully dressed, and had apparently already
been out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I have also had a ramble through the
Ragged Shaw. Now, Watson, there is cocoa ready
in the next room. I must beg you to hurry, for we
have a great day before us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes shone, and his cheek was flushed with
the exhilaration of the master workman who sees
his work lie ready before him. A very different
Holmes, this active, alert man, from the introspec-
tive and pallid dreamer of Baker Street. I felt, as
I looked upon that supple figure, alive with ner-
vous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day
that awaited us.
</p>
<p>And yet it opened in the blackest disappoint-
ment. With high hopes we struck across the peaty,
russet moor, intersected with a thousand sheep
paths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt
which marked the morass between us and Holder-
nesse. Certainly, if the lad had gone homewards,
he must have passed this, and he could not pass
it without leaving his traces. But no sign of him
or the German could be seen. With a darkening
face my friend strode along the margin, eagerly
observant of every muddy stain upon the mossy
surface. Sheep-marks there were in profusion, and
at one place, some miles down, cows had left their
tracks. Nothing more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Check number one,&#8221; said Holmes, looking
gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor.
&#8220;There is another morass down yonder and a nar-
row neck between. Halloa! halloa! halloa! what
have we here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>478</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>We had come on a small black ribbon of path-
way. In the middle of it, clearly marked on the
sodden soil, was the track of a bicycle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;We have it.&#8221;
But Holmes was shaking his head, and his face
</p>
<p>was puzzled and expectant rather than joyous.
&#8220;A bicycle, certainly, but not the bicycle,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>he. &#8220;I am familiar with forty-two different im-
pressions left by tyres. This, as you perceive, is
a Dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. Hei-
degger&#8217;s tyres were Palmer&#8217;s, leaving longitudi-
nal stripes. Aveling, the mathematical master, was
sure upon the point. Therefore, it is not Heideg-
ger&#8217;s track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Possibly, if we could prove a bicycle to have
</p>
<p>been in his possession. But this we have utterly
failed to do. This track, as you perceive, was made
by a rider who was going from the direction of the
school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or towards it?&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, my dear Watson. The more deeply
</p>
<p>sunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel,
upon which the weight rests. You perceive several
places where it has passed across and obliterated
the more shallow mark of the front one. It was un-
doubtedly heading away from the school. It may
or may not be connected with our inquiry, but we
will follow it backwards before we go any farther.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We did so, and at the end of a few hundred
yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the
boggy portion of the moor. Following the path
backwards, we picked out another spot, where a
spring trickled across it. Here, once again, was the
mark of the bicycle, though nearly obliterated by
the hoofs of cows. After that there was no sign, but
the path ran right on into Ragged Shaw, the wood
which backed on to the school. From this wood
the cycle must have emerged. Holmes sat down
on a boulder and rested his chin in his hands. I
had smoked two cigarettes before he moved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said he, at last. &#8220;It is, of course,
possible that a cunning man might change the tyre
of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks. A
criminal who was capable of such a thought is a
man whom I should be proud to do business with.
We will leave this question undecided and hark
back to our morass again, for we have left a good
deal unexplored.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We continued our systematic survey of the
edge of the sodden portion of the moor, and soon
our perseverance was gloriously rewarded. Right
across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path.
</p>
<p>Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached
it. An impression like a fine bundle of telegraph
wires ran down the centre of it. It was the Palmer
tyre.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!&#8221; cried
Holmes, exultantly. &#8220;My reasoning seems to have
been pretty sound, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you.&#8221;
&#8220;But we have a long way still to go. Kindly
</p>
<p>walk clear of the path. Now let us follow the trail.
I fear that it will not lead very far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We found, however, as we advanced that
this portion of the moor is intersected with soft
patches, and, though we frequently lost sight of
the track, we always succeeded in picking it up
once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you observe,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that the rider
is now undoubtedly forcing the pace? There can
be no doubt of it. Look at this impression, where
you get both tyres clear. The one is as deep as the
other. That can only mean that the rider is throw-
ing his weight on to the handle-bar, as a man does
when he is sprinting. By Jove! he has had a fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a broad, irregular smudge covering
some yards of the track. Then there were a few
footmarks, and the tyre reappeared once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A side-slip,&#8221; I suggested.
Holmes held up a crumpled branch of flower-
</p>
<p>ing gorse. To my horror I perceived that the yellow
blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. On the
path, too, and among the heather were dark stains
of clotted blood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Bad! Stand clear, Wat-
son! Not an unnecessary footstep! What do I
read here? He fell wounded, he stood up, he
remounted, he proceeded. But there is no other
track. Cattle on this side path. He was surely not
gored by a bull? Impossible! But I see no traces
of anyone else. We must push on, Watson. Surely
with stains as well as the track to guide us he can-
not escape us now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our search was not a very long one. The tracks
of the tyre began to curve fantastically upon the
wet and shining path. Suddenly, as I looked ahead,
the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the
thick gorse bushes. Out of them we dragged a bi-
cycle, Palmer-tyred, one pedal bent, and the whole
front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with
blood. On the other side of the bushes a shoe was
projecting. We ran round, and there lay the unfor-
tunate rider. He was a tall man, full bearded, with
spectacles, one glass of which had been knocked
out. The cause of his death was a frightful blow
upon the head, which had crushed in part of his
</p>
<p>479</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>skull. That he could have gone on after receiv-
ing such an injury said much for the vitality and
courage of the man. He wore shoes, but no socks,
and his open coat disclosed a night-shirt beneath
it. It was undoubtedly the German master.
</p>
<p>Holmes turned the body over reverently, and
examined it with great attention. He then sat in
deep thought for a time, and I could see by his
ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not, in
his opinion, advanced us much in our inquiry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a little difficult to know what to do, Wat-
son,&#8221; said he, at last. &#8220;My own inclinations are to
push this inquiry on, for we have already lost so
much time that we cannot afford to waste another
hour. On the other hand, we are bound to inform
the police of the discovery, and to see that this poor
fellow&#8217;s body is looked after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could take a note back.&#8221;
&#8220;But I need your company and assistance. Wait
</p>
<p>a bit! There is a fellow cutting peat up yonder.
Bring him over here, and he will guide the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I brought the peasant across, and Holmes dis-
patched the frightened man with a note to Dr.
Huxtable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we have picked up
two clues this morning. One is the bicycle with
the Palmer tyre, and we see what that has led to.
The other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop.
Before we start to investigate that, let us try to re-
alize what we do know so as to make the most of it,
and to separate the essential from the accidental.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all I wish to impress upon you that the
boy certainly left of his own free will. He got down
from his window and he went off, either alone or
with someone. That is sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I assented.
&#8220;Well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate Ger-
</p>
<p>man master. The boy was fully dressed when he
fled. Therefore, he foresaw what he would do. But
the German went without his socks. He certainly
acted on very short notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#8221;
&#8220;Why did he go? Because, from his bedroom
</p>
<p>window, he saw the flight of the boy. Because he
wished to overtake him and bring him back. He
seized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursu-
ing him met his death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would seem.&#8221;
&#8220;Now I come to the critical part of my argu-
</p>
<p>ment. The natural action of a man in pursuing a
little boy would be to run after him. He would
know that he could overtake him. But the German
</p>
<p>does not do so. He turns to his bicycle. I am told
that he was an excellent cyclist. He would not do
this if he did not see that the boy had some swift
means of escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other bicycle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us continue our reconstruction. He meets
his death five miles from the school&#8212;not by a bul-
let, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably
discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigor-
ous arm. The lad, then, had a companion in his
flight. And the flight was a swift one, since it took
five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake
them. Yet we survey the ground round the scene
of the tragedy. What do we find? A few cattle
tracks, nothing more. I took a wide sweep round,
and there is no path within fifty yards. Another cy-
clist could have had nothing to do with the actual
murder. Nor were there any human footmarks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;this is impossible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable!&#8221; he said. &#8220;A most illuminating re-
mark. It is impossible as I state it, and therefore I
must in some respect have stated it wrong. Yet you
saw for yourself. Can you suggest any fallacy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He could not have fractured his skull in a
fall?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a morass, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at my wit&#8217;s end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut; we have solved some worse prob-
lems. At least we have plenty of material, if we can
only use it. Come, then, and, having exhausted
the Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the
patched cover has to offer us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We picked up the track and followed it on-
wards for some distance; but soon the moor rose
into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the
watercourse behind us. No further help from
tracks could be hoped for. At the spot where we
saw the last of the Dunlop tyre it might equally
have led to Holdernesse Hall, the stately towers of
which rose some miles to our left, or to a low, grey
village which lay in front of us, and marked the
position of the Chesterfield high road.
</p>
<p>As we approached the forbidding and squalid
inn, with the sign of a game-cock above the door,
Holmes gave a sudden groan and clutched me by
the shoulder to save himself from falling. He had
had one of those violent strains of the ankle which
leave a man helpless. With difficulty he limped up
to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was
smoking a black clay pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Mr. Reuben Hayes?&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>480</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Who are you, and how do you get my name so
pat?&#8221; the countryman answered, with a suspicious
flash of a pair of cunning eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s printed on the board above your
head. It&#8217;s easy to see a man who is master of his
own house. I suppose you haven&#8217;t such a thing as
a carriage in your stables?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I have not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly put my foot to the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put it to the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, hop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Reuben Hayes&#8217;s manner was far from gra-
cious, but Holmes took it with admirable good-
humour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;This is really
rather an awkward fix for me. I don&#8217;t mind how I
get on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; said the morose landlord.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter is very important. I would offer
you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The landlord pricked up his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you want to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Holdernesse Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pals of the Dook, I suppose?&#8221; said the land-
lord, surveying our mud-stained garments with
ironical eyes.
</p>
<p>Holmes laughed good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be glad to see us, anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we bring him news of his lost son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The landlord gave a very visible start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you&#8217;re on his track?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been heard of in Liverpool. They ex-
pect to get him every hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again a swift change passed over the heavy,
unshaven face. His manner was suddenly genial.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve less reason to wish the Dook well than
most men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for I was his head coachman
once, and cruel bad he treated me. It was him that
sacked me without a character on the word of a
lying corn-chandler. But I&#8217;m glad to hear that the
young lord was heard of in Liverpool, and I&#8217;ll help
you to take the news to the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have some
food first. Then you can bring round the bicycle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got a bicycle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes held up a sovereign.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, man, that I haven&#8217;t got one. I&#8217;ll let
you have two horses as far as the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;we&#8217;ll talk about it
when we&#8217;ve had something to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we were left alone in the stone-flagged
kitchen it was astonishing how rapidly that
sprained ankle recovered. It was nearly nightfall,
and we had eaten nothing since early morning, so
that we spent some time over our meal. Holmes
was lost in thought, and once or twice he walked
over to the window and stared earnestly out. It
opened on to a squalid courtyard. In the far cor-
ner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work.
On the other side were the stables. Holmes had sat
down again after one of these excursions, when he
suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud ex-
clamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, Watson, I believe that I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Yes, yes, it must be so. Watson, do you
remember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, several.&#8221;
&#8220;Where?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, everywhere. They were at the morass,
</p>
<p>and again on the path, and again near where poor
Heidegger met his death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Well, now, Watson, how many cows
did you see on the moor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember seeing any.&#8221;
&#8220;Strange, Watson, that we should see tracks all
</p>
<p>along our line, but never a cow on the whole moor;
very strange, Watson, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is strange.&#8221;
&#8220;Now, Watson, make an effort; throw your
</p>
<p>mind back! Can you see those tracks upon the
path?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can.&#8221;
&#8220;Can you recall that the tracks were some-
</p>
<p>times like that, Watson&#8221;&#8212;he arranged a number
of bread-crumbs in this fashion&#8212;: : : : :&#8212;&#8220;and
sometimes like this&#8221;&#8212;: . : . : . : .&#8212;&#8220;and occasion-
ally like this&#8221;&#8212;. . . . . . . &#8220;Can you remember
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot.&#8221;
&#8220;But I can. I could swear to it. However, we
</p>
<p>will go back at our leisure and verify it. What a
blind beetle I have been not to draw my conclu-
sion!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is your conclusion?&#8221;
&#8220;Only that it is a remarkable cow which walks,
</p>
<p>canters, and gallops. By George, Watson, it was no
brain of a country publican that thought out such
a blind as that! The coast seems to be clear, save

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>for that lad in the smithy. Let us slip out and see
what we can see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were two rough-haired, unkempt horses
in the tumble-down stable. Holmes raised the hind
leg of one of them and laughed aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old shoes, but newly shod&#8212;old shoes, but
new nails. This case deserves to be a classic. Let
us go across to the smithy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad continued his work without regarding
us. I saw Holmes&#8217;s eye darting to right and left
among the litter of iron and wood which was scat-
tered about the floor. Suddenly, however, we heard
a step behind us, and there was the landlord, his
heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes, his
swarthy features convulsed with passion. He held
a short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he ad-
vanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right
glad to feel the revolver in my pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You infernal spies!&#8221; the man cried. &#8220;What are
you doing there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Reuben Hayes,&#8221; said Holmes, coolly,
&#8220;one might think that you were afraid of our find-
ing something out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man mastered himself with a violent effort,
and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh,
which was more menacing than his frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to all you can find out in my
smithy,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But look here, mister, I don&#8217;t
care for folk poking about my place without my
leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get
out of this the better I shall be pleased.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Hayes&#8212;no harm meant,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;We have been having a look at your
horses, but I think I&#8217;ll walk after all. It&#8217;s not far,
I believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than two miles to the Hall gates.
That&#8217;s the road to the left.&#8221; He watched us with
sullen eyes until we had left his premises.
</p>
<p>We did not go very far along the road, for
Holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us
from the landlord&#8217;s view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were warm, as the children say, at that
inn,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I seem to grow colder every step
that I take away from it. No, no; I can&#8217;t possibly
leave it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that this Reuben
Hayes knows all about it. A more self-evident vil-
lain I never saw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he impressed you in that way, did he?
There are the horses, there is the smithy. Yes, it
is an interesting place, this Fighting Cock. I think
</p>
<p>we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A long, sloping hillside, dotted with grey lime-
stone boulders, stretched behind us. We had
turned off the road, and were making our way up
the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holder-
nesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down, Watson!&#8221; cried Holmes, with a
heavy hand upon my shoulder. We had hardly
sunk from view when the man flew past us on
the road. Amid a rolling cloud of dust I caught a
glimpse of a pale, agitated face&#8212;a face with hor-
ror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes
staring wildly in front. It was like some strange
caricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we
had seen the night before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duke&#8217;s secretary!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;Come,
Watson, let us see what he does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We scrambled from rock to rock until in a few
moments we had made our way to a point from
which we could see the front door of the inn.
Wilder&#8217;s bicycle was leaning against the wall be-
side it. No one was moving about the house, nor
could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the win-
dows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun
sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall.
Then in the gloom we saw the two side-lamps of
a trap light up in the stable yard of the inn, and
shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it
wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious
pace in the direction of Chesterfield.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that, Watson?&#8221; Holmes
whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a flight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could
see. Well, it certainly was not Mr. James Wilder,
for there he is at the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A red square of light had sprung out of the
darkness. In the middle of it was the black fig-
ure of the secretary, his head advanced, peering
out into the night. It was evident that he was ex-
pecting someone. Then at last there were steps in
the road, a second figure was visible for an instant
against the light, the door shut, and all was black
once more. Five minutes later a lamp was lit in a
room upon the first floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be a curious class of custom that is
done by the Fighting Cock,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The bar is on the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. These are what one may call the pri-
vate guests. Now, what in the world is Mr. James
Wilder doing in that den at this hour of night, and
</p>
<p>482</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>who is the companion who comes to meet him
there? Come, Watson, we must really take a risk
and try to investigate this a little more closely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Together we stole down to the road and crept
across to the door of the inn. The bicycle still
leaned against the wall. Holmes struck a match
and held it to the back wheel, and I heard him
chuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop
tyre. Up above us was the lighted window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have a peep through that, Watson. If
you bend your back and support yourself upon the
wall, I think that I can manage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An instant later his feet were on my shoulders.
But he was hardly up before he was down again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, my friend,&#8221; said he, &#8220;our day&#8217;s work
has been quite long enough. I think that we have
gathered all that we can. It&#8217;s a long walk to the
school, and the sooner we get started the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hardly opened his lips during that weary
trudge across the moor, nor would he enter the
school when he reached it, but went on to Mackle-
ton Station, whence he could send some telegrams.
Late at night I heard him consoling Dr. Huxtable,
prostrated by the tragedy of his master&#8217;s death,
and later still he entered my room as alert and
vigorous as he had been when he started in the
morning. &#8220;All goes well, my friend,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
promise that before to-morrow evening we shall
have reached the solution of the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock next morning my friend and I
were walking up the famous yew avenue of Hold-
ernesse Hall. We were ushered through the mag-
nificent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace&#8217;s
study. There we found Mr. James Wilder, demure
and courtly, but with some trace of that wild terror
of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes
and in his twitching features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come to see his Grace? I am sorry;
but the fact is that the Duke is far from well. He
has been very much upset by the tragic news. We
received a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday
afternoon, which told us of your discovery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see the Duke, Mr. Wilder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is in his room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must go to his room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he is in his bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s cold and inexorable manner showed
the secretary that it was useless to argue with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Mr. Holmes; I will tell him that
you are here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After half an hour&#8217;s delay the great nobleman
appeared. His face was more cadaverous than
ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed
to me to be an altogether older man than he had
been the morning before. He greeted us with a
stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk, his
red beard streaming down on to the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; said he.
But my friend&#8217;s eyes were fixed upon the sec-
</p>
<p>retary, who stood by his master&#8217;s chair.
&#8220;I think, your Grace, that I could speak more
</p>
<p>freely in Mr. Wilder&#8217;s absence.&#8221;
The man turned a shade paler and cast a ma-
</p>
<p>lignant glance at Holmes.
&#8220;If your Grace wishes&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, yes; you had better go. Now, Mr. Holmes,
</p>
<p>what have you to say?&#8221;
My friend waited until the door had closed be-
</p>
<p>hind the retreating secretary.
&#8220;The fact is, your Grace,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that my col-
</p>
<p>league, Dr. Watson, and myself had an assurance
from Dr. Huxtable that a reward had been offered
in this case. I should like to have this confirmed
from your own lips.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;It amounted, if I am correctly informed, to
</p>
<p>five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you
where your son is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;And another thousand to the man who will
</p>
<p>name the person or persons who keep him in cus-
tody?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;Under the latter heading is included, no
</p>
<p>doubt, not only those who may have taken him
away, but also those who conspire to keep him in
his present position?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; cried the Duke, impatiently. &#8220;If
you do your work well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you
will have no reason to complain of niggardly treat-
ment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend rubbed his thin hands together with
an appearance of avidity which was a surprise to
me, who knew his frugal tastes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy that I see your Grace&#8217;s cheque-book
upon the table,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I should be glad if you
would make me out a cheque for six thousand
pounds. It would be as well, perhaps, for you to
cross it. The Capital and Counties Bank, Oxford
Street branch, are my agents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His Grace sat very stern and upright in his
chair, and looked stonily at my friend.
</p>
<p>483</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Priory School
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this a joke, Mr. Holmes? It is hardly a sub-
ject for pleasantry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, your Grace. I was never more
earnest in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that I have earned the reward. I know
where your son is, and I know some, at least, of
those who are holding him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Duke&#8217;s beard had turned more aggres-
sively red than ever against his ghastly white face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, or was last night, at the Fighting Cock
Inn, about two miles from your park gate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Duke fell back in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And whom do you accuse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s answer was an astounding
one. He stepped swiftly forward and touched the
Duke upon the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I accuse you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And now, your Grace,
I&#8217;ll trouble you for that cheque.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the Duke&#8217;s appearance as
he sprang up and clawed with his hands like one
who is sinking into an abyss. Then, with an ex-
traordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he
sat down and sank his face in his hands. It was
some minutes before he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you know?&#8221; he asked at last,
without raising his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you together last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anyone else besides your friend know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken to no one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers
and opened his cheque-book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be as good as my word, Mr. Holmes.
I am about to write your cheque, however unwel-
come the information which you have gained may
be to me. When the offer was first made I little
thought the turn which events might take. But
you and your friend are men of discretion, Mr.
Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly understand your Grace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must put it plainly, Mr. Holmes. If only you
two know of this incident, there is no reason why
it should go any farther. I think twelve thousand
pounds is the sum that I owe you, is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Holmes smiled and shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear, your Grace, that matters can hardly
be arranged so easily. There is the death of this
schoolmaster to be accounted for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But James knew nothing of that. You cannot
hold him responsible for that. It was the work of
this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to
employ.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must take the view, your Grace, that when a
man embarks upon a crime he is morally guilty of
any other crime which may spring from it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morally, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right.
But surely not in the eyes of the law. A man cannot
be condemned for a murder at which he was not
present, and which he loathes and abhors as much
as you do. The instant that he heard of it he made
a complete confession to me, so filled was he with
horror and remorse. He lost not an hour in break-
ing entirely with the murderer. Oh, Mr. Holmes,
you must save him&#8212;you must save him! I tell you
that you must save him!&#8221; The Duke had dropped
the last attempt at self-command, and was pac-
ing the room with a convulsed face and with his
clenched hands raving in the air. At last he mas-
tered himself and sat down once more at his desk.
&#8220;I appreciate your conduct in coming here before
you spoke to anyone else,&#8221; said he. &#8220;At least, we
may take counsel how far we can minimize this
hideous scandal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I think, your Grace,
that this can only be done by absolute and com-
plete frankness between us. I am disposed to help
your Grace to the best of my ability; but in order to
do so I must understand to the last detail how the
matter stands. I realize that your words applied to
Mr. James Wilder, and that he is not the murderer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the murderer has escaped.&#8221;
Sherlock Holmes smiled demurely.
&#8220;Your Grace can hardly have heard of any
</p>
<p>small reputation which I possess, or you would
not imagine that it is so easy to escape me. Mr.
Reuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on my
information at eleven o&#8217;clock last night. I had a
telegram from the head of the local police before I
left the school this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Duke leaned back in his chair and stared
with amazement at my friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have powers that are hardly hu-
man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So Reuben Hayes is taken? I am
right glad to hear it, if it will not react upon the
fate of James.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your secretary?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; my son.&#8221;
It was Holmes&#8217;s turn to look astonished.
&#8220;I confess that this is entirely new to me, your
</p>
<p>Grace. I must beg you to be more explicit.&#8221;
&#8220;I will conceal nothing from you. I agree with
</p>
<p>you that complete frankness, however painful it
</p>
<p>484</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>may be to me, is the best policy in this desper-
ate situation to which James&#8217;s folly and jealousy
have reduced us. When I was a very young man,
Mr. Holmes, I loved with such a love as comes
only once in a lifetime. I offered the lady mar-
riage, but she refused it on the grounds that such
a match might mar my career. Had she lived I
would certainly never have married anyone else.
She died, and left this one child, whom for her
sake I have cherished and cared for. I could not
acknowledge the paternity to the world; but I gave
him the best of educations, and since he came to
manhood I have kept him near my person. He
surprised my secret, and has presumed ever since
upon the claim which he has upon me and upon
his power of provoking a scandal, which would be
abhorrent to me. His presence had something to
do with the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above
all, he hated my young legitimate heir from the
first with a persistent hatred. You may well ask me
why, under these circumstances, I still kept James
under my roof. I answer that it was because I could
see his mother&#8217;s face in his, and that for her dear
sake there was no end to my long-suffering. All
her pretty ways, too&#8212;there was not one of them
which he could not suggest and bring back to my
memory. I could not send him away. But I feared
so much lest he should do Arthur&#8212;that is, Lord
Saltire&#8212;a mischief that I dispatched him for safety
to Dr. Huxtable&#8217;s school.
</p>
<p>&#8220;James came into contact with this fellow
Hayes because the man was a tenant of mine,
and James acted as agent. The fellow was a ras-
cal from the beginning; but in some extraordinary
way James became intimate with him. He had al-
ways a taste for low company. When James deter-
mined to kidnap Lord Saltire it was of this man&#8217;s
service that he availed himself. You remember
that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. Well,
James opened the letter and inserted a note ask-
ing Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the
Ragged Shaw, which is near to the school. He
used the Duchess&#8217;s name, and in that way got
the boy to come. That evening James bicycled
over&#8212;I am telling you what he has himself con-
fessed to me&#8212;and he told Arthur, whom he met
in the wood, that his mother longed to see him,
that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that
if he would come back into the wood at midnight
he would find a man with a horse, who would
take him to h
