<p>hen I look at the three massive
manuscript volumes which contain our
work for the year 1894 I confess that it
is very difficult for me, out of such a
</p>
<p>wealth of material, to select the cases which are
most interesting in themselves and at the same
time most conducive to a display of those pecu-
liar powers for which my friend was famous. As
I turn over the pages I see my notes upon the
repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible
death of Crosby the banker. Here also I find an
account of the Addleton tragedy and the singu-
lar contents of the ancient British barrow. The fa-
mous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes also
within this period, and so does the tracking and
arrest of Huret, the Boulevard assassin&#8212;an ex-
ploit which won for Holmes an autograph letter
of thanks from the French President and the Order
of the Legion of Honour. Each of these would fur-
nish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion
that none of them unite so many singular points of
interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which
includes not only the lamentable death of young
Willoughby Smith, but also those subsequent de-
velopments which threw so curious a light upon
the causes of the crime.
</p>
<p>It was a wild, tempestuous night towards the
close of November. Holmes and I sat together in
silence all the evening, he engaged with a pow-
erful lens deciphering the remains of the original
inscription upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent
treatise upon surgery. Outside the wind howled
down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely
against the windows. It was strange there in the
very depths of the town, with ten miles of man&#8217;s
handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip
of Nature, and to be conscious that to the huge el-
emental forces all London was no more than the
molehills that dot the fields. I walked to the win-
dow and looked out on the deserted street. The oc-
casional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy
road and shining pavement. A single cab was
splashing its way from the Oxford Street end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, it&#8217;s as well we have not to turn
out to-night,&#8221; said Holmes, laying aside his lens
and rolling up the palimpsest. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done enough
for one sitting. It is trying work for the eyes. So
far as I can make out it is nothing more exciting
than an Abbey&#8217;s accounts dating from the second
half of the fifteenth century. Halloa! halloa! halloa!
What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Amid the droning of the wind there had come
the stamping of a horse&#8217;s hoofs and the long grind
of a wheel as it rasped against the kerb. The cab
which I had seen had pulled up at our door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can he want?&#8221; I ejaculated, as a man
stepped out of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want! He wants us. And we, my poor Watson,
want overcoats and cravats and galoshes, and ev-
ery aid that man ever invented to fight the weather.
Wait a bit, though! There&#8217;s the cab off again!
There&#8217;s hope yet. He&#8217;d have kept it if he had
wanted us to come. Run down, my dear fellow,
and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been
long in bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our
midnight visitor I had no difficulty in recognising
him. It was young Stanley Hopkins, a promis-
ing detective, in whose career Holmes had several
times shown a very practical interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he in?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.
&#8220;Come up, my dear sir,&#8221; said Holmes&#8217;s voice
</p>
<p>from above. &#8220;I hope you have no designs upon us
on such a night as this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp
gleamed upon his shining waterproof. I helped
him out of it while Holmes knocked a blaze out of
the logs in the grate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my dear Hopkins, draw up and warm
your toes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a cigar, and the doc-
tor has a prescription containing hot water and a
lemon which is good medicine on a night like this.
It must be something important which has brought
you out in such a gale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed, Mr. Holmes. I&#8217;ve had a bustling
afternoon, I promise you. Did you see anything of
the Yoxley case in the latest editions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth cen-
tury to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong
at that, so you have not missed anything. I haven&#8217;t
let the grass grow under my feet. It&#8217;s down in
Kent, seven miles from Chatham and three from
the railway line. I was wired for at three-fifteen,
reached Yoxley Old Place at five, conducted my in-
vestigation, was back at Charing Cross by the last
train, and straight to you by cab.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means, I suppose, that you are not
quite clear about your case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that I can make neither head nor tail
of it. So far as I can see it is just as tangled a busi-
ness as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed
so simple that one couldn&#8217;t go wrong. There&#8217;s no
motive, Mr. Holmes. That&#8217;s what bothers me&#8212;I
can&#8217;t put my hand on a motive. Here&#8217;s a man
dead&#8212;there&#8217;s no denying that&#8212;but, so far as I can
see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish
him harm.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez
</p>
<p>Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hear about it,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my facts pretty clear,&#8221; said Stanley
Hopkins. &#8220;All I want now is to know what they
all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out,
is like this. Some years ago this country house,
Yoxley Old Place, was taken by an elderly man,
who gave the name of Professor Coram. He was
an invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the
other half hobbling round the house with a stick
or being pushed about the grounds by the gar-
dener in a bath-chair. He was well liked by the
few neighbours who called upon him, and he has
the reputation down there of being a very learned
man. His household used to consist of an elderly
housekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, Susan
Tarlton. These have both been with him since his
arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent
character. The Professor is writing a learned book,
and he found it necessary about a year ago to en-
gage a secretary. The first two that he tried were
not successes; but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith,
a very young man straight from the University,
seems to have been just what his employer wanted.
His work consisted in writing all the morning to
the Professor&#8217;s dictation, and he usually spent
the evening in hunting up references and pas-
sages which bore upon the next day&#8217;s work. This
Willoughby Smith has nothing against him either
as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cam-
bridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the
first he was a decent, quiet, hardworking fellow,
with no weak spot in him at all. And yet this is
the lad who has met his death this morning in the
Professor&#8217;s study under circumstances which can
point only to murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wind howled and screamed at the win-
dows. Holmes and I drew closer to the fire while
the young inspector slowly and point by point de-
veloped his singular narrative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were to search all England,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you could find a household
more self-contained or free from outside influ-
ences. Whole weeks would pass and not one of
them go past the garden gate. The Professor was
buried in his work and existed for nothing else.
Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood,
and lived very much as his employer did. The two
women had nothing to take them from the house.
Mortimer the gardener, who wheels the bath-chair,
is an Army pensioner&#8212;an old Crimean man of ex-
cellent character. He does not live in the house, but
in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the
</p>
<p>garden. Those are the only people that you would
find within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place. At
the same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred
yards from the main London to Chatham road. It
opens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent
anyone from walking in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will give you the evidence of Susan
Tarlton, who is the only person who can say any-
thing positive about the matter. It was in the
forenoon, between eleven and twelve. She was en-
gaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in
the upstairs front bedroom. Professor Coram was
still in bed, for when the weather is bad he sel-
dom rises before midday. The housekeeper was
busied with some work in the back of the house.
Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which
he uses as a sitting-room; but the maid heard him
at that moment pass along the passage and de-
scend to the study immediately below her. She
did not see him, but she says that she could not
be mistaken in his quick, firm tread. She did not
hear the study door close, but a minute or so later
there was a dreadful cry in the room below. It was
a wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural
that it might have come either from a man or a
woman. At the same instant there was a heavy
thud, which shook the old house, and then all
was silence. The maid stood petrified for a mo-
ment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran
downstairs. The study door was shut, and she
opened it. Inside young Mr. Willoughby Smith
was stretched upon the floor. At first she could
see no injury, but as she tried to raise him she
saw that blood was pouring from the underside of
his neck. It was pierced by a very small but very
deep wound, which had divided the carotid artery.
The instrument with which the injury had been in-
flicted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one
of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on
old-fashioned writing-tables, with an ivory handle
and a stiff blade. It was part of the fittings of the
Professor&#8217;s own desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At first the maid thought that young Smith
was already dead, but on pouring some water
from the carafe over his forehead he opened his
eyes for an instant. &#8216;The Professor,&#8217; he mur-
mured&#8212;&#8216;it was she.&#8217; The maid is prepared to
swear that those were the exact words. He tried
desperately to say something else, and he held his
right hand up in the air. Then he fell back dead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime the housekeeper had also ar-
rived upon the scene, but she was just too late
to catch the young man&#8217;s dying words. Leaving
</p>
<p>534</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Susan with the body, she hurried to the Profes-
sor&#8217;s room. He was sitting up in bed horribly ag-
itated, for he had heard enough to convince him
that something terrible had occurred. Mrs. Marker
is prepared to swear that the Professor was still
in his night-clothes, and, indeed, it was impossi-
ble for him to dress without the help of Mortimer,
whose orders were to come at twelve o&#8217;clock. The
Professor declares that he heard the distant cry, but
that he knows nothing more. He can give no expla-
nation of the young man&#8217;s last words, &#8216;The Profes-
sor&#8212;it was she,&#8217; but imagines that they were the
outcome of delirium. He believes that Willoughby
Smith had not an enemy in the world, and can
give no reason for the crime. His first action was
to send Mortimer the gardener for the local po-
lice. A little later the chief constable sent for me.
Nothing was moved before I got there, and strict
orders were given that no one should walk upon
the paths leading to the house. It was a splendid
chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes. There was really nothing want-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; said my com-
panion, with a somewhat bitter smile. &#8220;Well, let
us hear about it. What sort of job did you make of
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes, to glance
at this rough plan, which will give you a general
idea of the position of the Professor&#8217;s study and
the various points of the case. It will help you in
following my investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He unfolded the rough chart, which I here re-
produce, and he laid it across Holmes&#8217;s knee. I
rose, and, standing behind Holmes, I studied it
over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very rough, of course, and it only deals
with the points which seem to me to be essential.
All the rest you will see later for yourself. Now,
first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the
house, how did he or she come in? Undoubtedly
by the garden path and the back door, from which
</p>
<p>there is direct access to the study. Any other way
would have been exceedingly complicated. The es-
cape must have also been made along that line,
for of the two other exits from the room one was
blocked by Susan as she ran downstairs and the
other leads straight to the Professor&#8217;s bedroom. I
therefore directed my attention at once to the gar-
den path, which was saturated with recent rain
and would certainly show any footmarks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My examination showed me that I was deal-
ing with a cautious and expert criminal. No foot-
marks were to be found on the path. There could
be no question, however, that someone had passed
along the grass border which lines the path, and
that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a
track. I could not find anything in the nature of
a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden
down and someone had undoubtedly passed. It
could only have been the murderer, since neither
the gardener nor anyone else had been there that
morning and the rain had only begun during the
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Where does this
path lead to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the road.&#8221;
&#8220;How long is it?&#8221;
&#8220;A hundred yards or so.&#8221;
&#8220;At the point where the path passes through
</p>
<p>the gate you could surely pick up the tracks?&#8221;
&#8220;Unfortunately, the path was tiled at that
</p>
<p>point.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, on the road itself?&#8221;
&#8220;No; it was all trodden into mire.&#8221;
&#8220;Tut-tut! Well, then, these tracks upon the
</p>
<p>grass, were they coming or going?&#8221;
&#8220;It was impossible to say. There was never any
</p>
<p>outline.&#8221;
&#8220;A large foot or a small?&#8221;
&#8220;You could not distinguish.&#8221;
Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience.
&#8220;It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurri-
</p>
<p>cane ever since,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It will be harder to read
now than that palimpsest. Well, well, it can&#8217;t be
helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had
made certain that you had made certain of noth-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr.
Holmes. I knew that someone had entered the
house cautiously from without. I next examined
the corridor. It is lined with cocoanut matting and
had taken no impression of any kind. This brought
me into the study itself. It is a scantily-furnished
</p>
<p>535</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez
</p>
<p>room. The main article is a large writing-table with
a fixed bureau. This bureau consists of a dou-
ble column of drawers with a central small cup-
board between them. The drawers were open, the
cupboard locked. The drawers, it seems, were al-
ways open, and nothing of value was kept in them.
There were some papers of importance in the cup-
board, but there were no signs that this had been
tampered with, and the Professor assures me that
nothing was missing. It is certain that no robbery
has been committed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I come now to the body of the young man. It
was found near the bureau, and just to the left of
it, as marked upon that chart. The stab was on the
right side of the neck and from behind forwards,
so that it is almost impossible that it could have
been self-inflicted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he fell upon the knife,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Exactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we
</p>
<p>found the knife some feet away from the body, so
that seems impossible. Then, of course, there are
the man&#8217;s own dying words. And, finally, there
was this very important piece of evidence which
was found clasped in the dead man&#8217;s right hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small
paper packet. He unfolded it and disclosed a
golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black
silk cord dangling from the end of it. &#8220;Willoughby
Smith had excellent sight,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There can
be no question that this was snatched from the face
or the person of the assassin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand
and examined them with the utmost attention and
interest. He held them on his nose, endeavoured
to read through them, went to the window and
stared up the street with them, looked at them
most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and
finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table
and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which
he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best I can do for you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It
may prove to be of some use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The astonished detective read the note aloud.
It ran as follows:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanted, a woman of good address,
attired like a lady. She has a remark-
ably thick nose, with eyes which are
set close upon either side of it. She
has a puckered forehead, a peering ex-
pression, and probably rounded shoul-
ders. There are indications that she
has had recourse to an optician at least
twice during the last few months. As
</p>
<p>her glasses are of remarkable strength
and as opticians are not very numer-
ous, there should be no difficulty in
tracing her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins,
which must have been reflected upon my features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;It would be difficult to name any arti-
cles which afford a finer field for inference than a
pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as
these. That they belong to a woman I infer from
their delicacy, and also, of course, from the last
words of the dying man. As to her being a per-
son of refinement and well dressed, they are, as
you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold,
and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such
glasses could be slatternly in other respects. You
will find that the clips are too wide for your nose,
showing that the lady&#8217;s nose was very broad at
the base. This sort of nose is usually a short and
coarse one, but there are a sufficient number of
exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or
from insisting upon this point in my description.
My own face is a narrow one, and yet I find that I
cannot get my eyes into the centre, or near the cen-
tre, of these glasses. Therefore the lady&#8217;s eyes are
set very near to the sides of the nose. You will per-
ceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of
unusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so
extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the
physical characteristics of such vision, which are
seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoul-
ders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can follow each of your argu-
ments. I confess, however, that I am unable to un-
derstand how you arrive at the double visit to the
optician.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took the glasses in his hand.
&#8220;You will perceive,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the clips are
</p>
<p>lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure
upon the nose. One of these is discoloured and
worn to some slight extent, but the other is new.
Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I
should judge that the older of them has not been
there more than a few months. They exactly cor-
respond, so I gather that the lady went back to the
same establishment for the second.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, it&#8217;s marvellous!&#8221; cried Hopkins, in
an ecstasy of admiration. &#8220;To think that I had all
that evidence in my hand and never knew it! I had
intended, however, to go the round of the London
opticians.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you would. Meanwhile, have you
anything more to tell us about the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>536</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Nothing, Mr. Holmes. I think that you know
as much as I do now&#8212;probably more. We have
had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the
country roads or at the railway station. We have
heard of none. What beats me is the utter want of
all object in the crime. Not a ghost of a motive can
anyone suggest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! there I am not in a position to help
you. But I suppose you want us to come out to-
morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes.
There&#8217;s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at
six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley
Old Place between eight and nine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly
some features of great interest, and I shall be de-
lighted to look into it. Well, it&#8217;s nearly one, and we
had best get a few hours&#8217; sleep. I dare say you can
manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. I&#8217;ll
light my spirit-lamp and give you a cup of coffee
before we start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gale had blown itself out next day, but it
was a bitter morning when we started upon our
journey. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the
dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen
reaches of the river, which I shall ever associate
with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the
earlier days of our career. After a long and weary
journey we alighted at a small station some miles
from Chatham. While a horse was being put into a
trap at the local inn we snatched a hurried break-
fast, and so we were all ready for business when
we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. A constable
met us at the garden gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Wilson, any news?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir, nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;No reports of any stranger seen?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir. Down at the station they are certain
</p>
<p>that no stranger either came or went yesterday.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you had inquiries made at inns and
</p>
<p>lodgings?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; there is no one that we cannot account
</p>
<p>for.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only a reasonable walk to Chatham.
</p>
<p>Anyone might stay there, or take a train without
being observed. This is the garden path of which I
spoke, Mr. Holmes. I&#8217;ll pledge my word there was
no mark on it yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On which side were the marks on the grass?&#8221;
&#8220;This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass be-
</p>
<p>tween the path and the flower-bed. I can&#8217;t see the
traces now, but they were clear to me then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; someone has passed along,&#8221; said
Holmes, stooping over the grass border. &#8220;Our lady
must have picked her steps carefully, must she not,
since on the one side she would leave a track on the
path, and on the other an even clearer one on the
soft bed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.&#8221;
I saw an intent look pass over Holmes&#8217;s face.
&#8220;You say that she must have come back this
</p>
<p>way?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; there is no other.&#8221;
&#8220;On this strip of grass?&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Hum! It was a very remarkable perfor-
</p>
<p>mance&#8212;very remarkable. Well, I think we have
exhausted the path. Let us go farther. This gar-
den door is usually kept open, I suppose? Then
this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. The
idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would
have provided herself with some sort of weapon,
instead of having to pick this knife off the writing-
table. She advanced along this corridor, leaving no
traces upon the cocoanut matting. Then she found
herself in this study. How long was she there? We
have no means of judging.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than a few minutes, sir. I forgot to
tell you that Mrs. Marker, the housekeeper, had
been in there tidying not very long before&#8212;about
a quarter of an hour, she says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that gives us a limit. Our lady enters
this room and what does she do? She goes over to
the writing-table. What for? Not for anything in
the drawers. If there had been anything worth her
taking it would surely have been locked up. No; it
was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa!
what is that scratch upon the face of it? Just hold
a match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this,
Hopkins?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mark which he was examining began upon
the brass work on the right-hand side of the key-
hole, and extended for about four inches, where it
had scratched the varnish from the surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed it, Mr. Holmes. But you&#8217;ll always
find scratches round a keyhole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is recent, quite recent. See how the brass
shines where it is cut. An old scratch would be the
same colour as the surface. Look at it through my
lens. There&#8217;s the varnish, too, like earth on each
side of a furrow. Is Mrs. Marker there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sad-faced, elderly woman came into the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you dust this bureau yesterday morn-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>537</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice this scratch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you did not, for a duster would have
swept away these shreds of varnish. Who has the
key of this bureau?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Professor keeps it on his watch-chain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a simple key?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; it is a Chubb&#8217;s key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. Mrs. Marker, you can go. Now we
are making a little progress. Our lady enters the
room, advances to the bureau, and either opens it
or tries to do so. While she is thus engaged young
Willoughby Smith enters the room. In her hurry
to withdraw the key she makes this scratch upon
the door. He seizes her, and she, snatching up
the nearest object, which happens to be this knife,
strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold.
The blow is a fatal one. He falls and she escapes,
either with or without the object for which she has
come. Is Susan the maid there? Could anyone have
got away through that door after the time that you
heard the cry, Susan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No sir; it is impossible. Before I got down the
stair I&#8217;d have seen anyone in the passage. Besides,
the door never opened, for I would have heard it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles this exit. Then no doubt the lady
went out the way she came. I understand that this
other passage leads only to the Professor&#8217;s room.
There is no exit that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall go down it and make the acquain-
tance of the Professor. Halloa, Hopkins! this is
very important, very important indeed. The Pro-
fessor&#8217;s corridor is also lined with cocoanut mat-
ting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, what of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see any bearing upon the case?
Well, well, I don&#8217;t insist upon it. No doubt I am
wrong. And yet it seems to me to be suggestive.
Come with me and introduce me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We passed down the passage, which was of the
same length as that which led to the garden. At
the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door.
Our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the
Professor&#8217;s bedroom.
</p>
<p>It was a very large chamber, lined with innu-
merable volumes, which had overflowed from the
shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were
stacked all round at the base of the cases. The
bed was in the centre of the room, and in it,
</p>
<p>propped up with pillows, was the owner of the
house. I have seldom seen a more remarkable-
looking person. It was a gaunt, aquiline face which
was turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes,
which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and
tufted brows. His hair and beard were white, save
that the latter was curiously stained with yellow
around his mouth. A cigarette glowed amid the
tangle of white hair, and the air of the room was
fetid with stale tobacco-smoke. As he held out his
hand to Holmes I perceived that it also was stained
yellow with nicotine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A smoker, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; said he, speaking
well-chosen English with a curious little mincing
accent. &#8220;Pray take a cigarette. And you, sir? I can
recommend them, for I have them especially pre-
pared by Ionides of Alexandria. He sends me a
thousand at a time, and I grieve to say that I have
to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. Bad,
sir, very bad, but an old man has few pleasures.
Tobacco and my work&#8212;that is all that is left to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had lit a cigarette, and was shooting
little darting glances all over the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,&#8221;
the old man exclaimed. &#8220;Alas! what a fatal inter-
ruption! Who could have foreseen such a terrible
catastrophe? So estimable a young man! I assure
you that after a few months&#8217; training he was an ad-
mirable assistant. What do you think of the matter,
Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not yet made up my mind.&#8221;
&#8220;I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can
</p>
<p>throw a light where all is so dark to us. To a poor
bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow
is paralyzing. I seem to have lost the faculty of
thought. But you are a man of action&#8212;you are a
man of affairs. It is part of the everyday routine of
your life. You can preserve your balance in every
emergency. We are fortunate indeed in having you
at our side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was pacing up and down one side of
the room whilst the old Professor was talking. I
observed that he was smoking with extraordinary
rapidity. It was evident that he shared our host&#8217;s
liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,&#8221; said the old
man. &#8220;That is my magnum opus&#8212;the pile of pa-
pers on the side table yonder. It is my analysis of
the documents found in the Coptic monasteries of
Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the
very foundations of revealed religion. With my en-
feebled health I do not know whether I shall ever
be able to complete it now that my assistant has
</p>
<p>538</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>been taken from me. Dear me, Mr. Holmes; why,
you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a connoisseur,&#8221; said he, taking another
cigarette from the box&#8212;his fourth&#8212;and lighting
it from the stub of that which he had finished.
&#8220;I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-
examination, Professor Coram, since I gather that
you were in bed at the time of the crime and could
know nothing about it. I would only ask this.
What do you imagine that this poor fellow meant
by his last words: &#8216;The Professor&#8212;it was she&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan is a country girl,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and you
know the incredible stupidity of that class. I fancy
that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent
delirious words, and that she twisted them into
this meaningless message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You have no explanation yourself of the
tragedy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly an accident; possibly&#8212;I only breathe
it among ourselves&#8212;a suicide. Young men have
their hidden troubles&#8212;some affair of the heart,
perhaps, which we have never known. It is a more
probable supposition than murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the eye-glasses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I am only a student&#8212;a man of dreams.
I cannot explain the practical things of life. But
still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may
take strange shapes. By all means take another
cigarette. It is a pleasure to see anyone appreci-
ate them so. A fan, a glove, glasses&#8212;who knows
what article may be carried as a token or treasured
when a man puts an end to his life? This gentle-
man speaks of footsteps in the grass; but, after all,
it is easy to be mistaken on such a point. As to the
knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfor-
tunate man as he fell. It is possible that I speak as
a child, but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith
has met his fate by his own hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put
forward, and he continued to walk up and down
for some time, lost in thought and consuming
cigarette after cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Professor Coram,&#8221; he said, at last,
&#8220;what is in that cupboard in the bureau?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing that would help a thief. Family pa-
pers, letters from my poor wife, diplomas of Uni-
versities which have done me honour. Here is the
key. You can look for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes picked up the key and looked at it for
an instant; then he handed it back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I hardly think that it would help me,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I should prefer to go quietly down to
your garden and turn the whole matter over in my
head. There is something to be said for the theory
of suicide which you have put forward. We must
apologize for having intruded upon you, Profes-
sor Coram, and I promise that we won&#8217;t disturb
you until after lunch. At two o&#8217;clock we will come
again and report to you anything which may have
happened in the interval.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked
up and down the garden path for some time in
silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a clue?&#8221; I asked, at last.
&#8220;It depends upon those cigarettes that I
</p>
<p>smoked,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is possible that I am utterly
mistaken. The cigarettes will show me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;how on
earth&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not,
there&#8217;s no harm done. Of course, we always have
the optician clue to fall back upon, but I take a
short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good
Mrs. Marker! Let us enjoy five minutes of instruc-
tive conversation with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I may have remarked before that Holmes had,
when he liked, a peculiarly ingratiating way with
women, and that he very readily established terms
of confidence with them. In half the time which
he had named he had captured the housekeeper&#8217;s
goodwill, and was chatting with her as if he had
known her for years.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes, it is as you say, sir. He
does smoke something terrible. All day and some-
times all night, sir. I&#8217;ve seen that room of a morn-
ing&#8212;well, sir, you&#8217;d have thought it was a London
fog. Poor young Mr. Smith, he was a smoker also,
but not as bad as the Professor. His health&#8212;well, I
don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s better nor worse for the smok-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;but it kills the appetite.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;I suppose the Professor eats hardly any-
</p>
<p>thing?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, he is variable. I&#8217;ll say that for him.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager he took no breakfast this morning,
</p>
<p>and won&#8217;t face his lunch after all the cigarettes I
saw him consume.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re out there, sir, as it happens, for
he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning. I
don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve known him make a better
one, and he&#8217;s ordered a good dish of cutlets for
his lunch. I&#8217;m surprised myself, for since I came
</p>
<p>539</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez
</p>
<p>into that room yesterday and saw young Mr. Smith
lying there on the floor I couldn&#8217;t bear to look at
food. Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and
the Professor hasn&#8217;t let it take his appetite away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We loitered the morning away in the garden.
Stanley Hopkins had gone down to the village to
look into some rumours of a strange woman who
had been seen by some children on the Chatham
Road the previous morning. As to my friend, all
his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. I
had never known him handle a case in such a half-
hearted fashion. Even the news brought back by
Hopkins that he had found the children and that
they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corre-
sponding with Holmes&#8217;s description, and wearing
either spectacles or eye-glasses, failed to rouse any
sign of keen interest. He was more attentive when
Susan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered
the information that she believed Mr. Smith had
been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he
had only returned half an hour before the tragedy
occurred. I could not myself see the bearing of this
incident, but I clearly perceived that Holmes was
weaving it into the general scheme which he had
formed in his brain. Suddenly he sprang from his
chair and glanced at his watch. &#8220;Two o&#8217;clock, gen-
tlemen,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We must go up and have it out
with our friend the Professor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man had just finished his lunch, and
certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good
appetite with which his housekeeper had credited
him. He was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned
his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us.
The eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth. He
had been dressed and was seated in an arm-chair
by the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, have you solved this mys-
tery yet?&#8221; He shoved the large tin of cigarettes
which stood on a table beside him towards my
companion. Holmes stretched out his hand at the
same moment, and between them they tipped the
box over the edge. For a minute or two we were all
on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from im-
possible places. When we rose again I observed
that Holmes&#8217;s eyes were shining and his cheeks
tinged with colour. Only at a crisis have I seen
those battle-signals flying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have solved it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement.
Something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt
features of the old Professor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! In the garden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! When?&#8221;
&#8220;This instant.&#8221;
&#8220;You are surely joking, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>You compel me to tell you that this is too serious a
matter to be treated in such a fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have forged and tested every link of my
chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is
sound. What your motives are or what exact part
you play in this strange business I am not yet able
to say. In a few minutes I shall probably hear
it from your own lips. Meanwhile I will recon-
struct what is past for your benefit, so that you
may know the information which I still require.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A lady yesterday entered your study. She
came with the intention of possessing herself of
certain documents which were in your bureau. She
had a key of her own. I have had an opportunity
of examining yours, and I do not find that slight
discolouration which the scratch made upon the
varnish would have produced. You were not an
accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as I can
read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Professor blew a cloud from his lips. &#8220;This
is most interesting and instructive,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Have
you no more to add? Surely, having traced this
lady so far, you can also say what has become of
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will endeavour to do so. In the first place
she was seized by your secretary, and stabbed him
in order to escape. This catastrophe I am inclined
to regard as an unhappy accident, for I am con-
vinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting
so grievous an injury. An assassin does not come
unarmed. Horrified by what she had done she
rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy.
Unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in
the scuffle, and as she was extremely short-sighted
she was really helpless without them. She ran
down a corridor, which she imagined to be that
by which she had come&#8212;both were lined with co-
coanut matting&#8212;and it was only when it was too
late that she understood that she had taken the
wrong passage and that her retreat was cut off be-
hind her. What was she to do? She could not go
back. She could not remain where she was. She
must go on. She went on. She mounted a stair,
pushed open a door, and found herself in your
room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man sat with his mouth open star-
ing wildly at Holmes. Amazement and fear were
stamped upon his expressive features. Now, with
an effort, he shrugged his shoulders and burst into
insincere laughter.
</p>
<p>540</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;All very fine, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But there
is one little flaw in your splendid theory. I was my-
self in my room, and I never left it during the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of that, Professor Coram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you mean to say that I could lie upon that
bed and not be aware that a woman had entered
my room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said so. You were aware of it. You
spoke with her. You recognised her. You aided her
to escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the Professor burst into high-keyed
laughter. He had risen to his feet and his eyes
glowed like embers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mad!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You are talking in-
sanely. I helped her to escape? Where is she now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is there,&#8221; said Holmes, and he pointed to
a high bookcase in the corner of the room.
</p>
<p>I saw the old man throw up his arms, a ter-
rible convulsion passed over his grim face, and
he fell back in his chair. At the same instant the
bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round
upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the
room. &#8220;You are right!&#8221; she cried, in a strange for-
eign voice. &#8220;You are right! I am here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was brown with the dust and draped with
the cobwebs which had come from the walls of
her hiding-place. Her face, too, was streaked with
grime, and at the best she could never have been
handsome, for she had the exact physical charac-
teristics which Holmes had divined, with, in ad-
dition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her
natural blindness, and what with the change from
dark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking
about her to see where and who we were. And yet,
in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a cer-
tain nobility in the woman&#8217;s bearing, a gallantry in
the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which
compelled something of respect and admiration.
Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm
and claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him
aside gently, and yet with an overmastering dig-
nity which compelled obedience. The old man lay
back in his chair, with a twitching face, and stared
at her with brooding eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I am your prisoner,&#8221; she said. &#8220;From
where I stood I could hear everything, and I know
that you have learned the truth. I confess it all.
It was I who killed the young man. But you are
right, you who say it was an accident. I did not
even know that it was a knife which I held in my
hand, for in my despair I snatched anything from
the table and struck at him to make him let me go.
It is the truth that I tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;I am sure that it is
the truth. I fear that you are far from well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had turned a dreadful colour, the more
ghastly under the dark dust-streaks upon her face.
She seated herself on the side of the bed; then she
resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only a little time here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
I would have you to know the whole truth. I am
this man&#8217;s wife. He is not an Englishman. He is a
Russian. His name I will not tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the first time the old man stirred. &#8220;God
bless you, Anna!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;God bless you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She cast a look of the deepest disdain in his
direction. &#8220;Why should you cling so hard to that
wretched life of yours, Sergius?&#8221; said she. &#8220;It has
done harm to many and good to none&#8212;not even to
yourself. However, it is not for me to cause the frail
thread to be snapped before God&#8217;s time. I have
enough already upon my soul since I crossed the
threshold of this cursed house. But I must speak
or I shall be too late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said, gentlemen, that I am this man&#8217;s
wife. He was fifty and I a foolish girl of twenty
when we married. It was in a city of Russia, a
University&#8212;I will not name the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Anna!&#8221; murmured the old
man again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were reformers&#8212;revolutionists&#8212;Nihilists,
you understand. He and I and many more. Then
there came a time of trouble, a police officer was
killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted,
and in order to save his own life and to earn a great
reward my husband betrayed his own wife and his
companions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his
confession. Some of us found our way to the gal-
lows and some to Siberia. I was among these last,
but my term was not for life. My husband came to
England with his ill-gotten gains, and has lived in
quiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brother-
hood knew where he was not a week would pass
before justice would be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man reached out a trembling hand and
helped himself to a cigarette. &#8220;I am in your hands,
Anna,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You were always good to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not yet told you the height of his vil-
lainy,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Among our comrades of the Or-
der there was one who was the friend of my heart.
He was noble, unselfish, loving&#8212;all that my hus-
band was not. He hated violence. We were all
guilty&#8212;if that is guilt&#8212;but he was not. He wrote
for ever dissuading us from such a course. These
letters would have saved him. So would my diary,
in which from day to day I had entered both my
feelings towards him and the view which each of
</p>
<p>541</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez
</p>
<p>us had taken. My husband found and kept both
diary and letters. He hid them, and he tried hard
to swear away the young man&#8217;s life. In this he
failed, but Alexis was sent a convict to Siberia,
where now, at this moment, he works in a salt
mine. Think of that, yo
