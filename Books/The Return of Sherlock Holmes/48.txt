<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>t was on a bitterly cold and frosty morn-
ing during the winter of &#8217;97 that I was
awakened by a tugging at my shoulder.
It was Holmes. The candle in his hand
</p>
<p>shone upon his eager, stooping face and told me
at a glance that something was amiss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Watson, come!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The game is
afoot. Not a word! Into your clothes and come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rat-
tling through the silent streets on our way to Char-
ing Cross Station. The first faint winter&#8217;s dawn
was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see
the occasional figure of an early workman as he
passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent
London reek. Holmes nestled in silence into his
heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the
air was most bitter and neither of us had broken
our fast. It was not until we had consumed some
hot tea at the station, and taken our places in the
Kentish train, that we were sufficiently thawed, he
to speak and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from
his pocket and read it aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abbey Grange, Marsham, Kent,
&#8220;3.30 a.m.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Holmes:
&#8220;I should be very glad of your imme-
</p>
<p>diate assistance in what promises to be
a most remarkable case. It is something
quite in your line. Except for releas-
ing the lady I will see that everything
is kept exactly as I have found it, but I
beg you not to lose an instant, as it is
difficult to leave Sir Eustace there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours faithfully,
&#8220;Stanley Hopkins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on
each occasion his summons has been entirely jus-
tified,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I fancy that every one of his
cases has found its way into your collection, and I
must admit, Watson, that you have some power of
selection which atones for much which I deplore in
your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at ev-
erything from the point of view of a story instead
of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might
have been an instructive and even classical series
of demonstrations. You slur over work of the ut-
most finesse and delicacy in order to dwell upon
sensational details which may excite, but cannot
possibly instruct, the reader.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you not write them yourself?&#8221; I said,
with some bitterness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, my dear Watson, I will. At present I am,
as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote
</p>
<p>my declining years to the composition of a text-
book which shall focus the whole art of detection
into one volume. Our present research appears to
be a case of murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?&#8221;
&#8220;I should say so. Hopkins&#8217;s writing shows con-
</p>
<p>siderable agitation, and he is not an emotional
man. Yes, I gather there has been violence, and
that the body is left for our inspection. A mere sui-
cide would not have caused him to send for me. As
to the release of the lady, it would appear that she
has been locked in her room during the tragedy.
We are moving in high life, Watson; crackling pa-
per, &#8216;E.B.&#8217; monogram, coat-of-arms, picturesque
address. I think that friend Hopkins will live up
to his reputation and that we shall have an inter-
esting morning. The crime was committed before
twelve last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you possibly tell?&#8221;
&#8220;By an inspection of the trains and by reckon-
</p>
<p>ing the time. The local police had to be called
in, they had to communicate with Scotland Yard,
Hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send
for me. All that makes a fair night&#8217;s work. Well,
here we are at Chislehurst Station, and we shall
soon set our doubts at rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A drive of a couple of miles through narrow
country lanes brought us to a park gate, which
was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose
haggard face bore the reflection of some great dis-
aster. The avenue ran through a noble park, be-
tween lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low,
widespread house, pillared in front after the fash-
ion of Palladio. The central part was evidently of
a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the large win-
dows showed that modern changes had been car-
ried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be
entirely new. The youthful figure and alert, eager
face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in
the open doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes.
And you too, Dr. Watson! But, indeed, if I had my
time over again I should not have troubled you, for
since the lady has come to herself she has given so
clear an account of the affair that there is not much
left for us to do. You remember that Lewisham
gang of burglars?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, the three Randalls?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly; the father and two sons. It&#8217;s their
</p>
<p>work. I have not a doubt of it. They did a job at
Sydenham a fortnight ago, and were seen and de-
scribed. Rather cool to do another so soon and so
near, but it is they, beyond all doubt. It&#8217;s a hanging
matter this time.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Abbey Grange
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Eustace is dead, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; his head was knocked in with his own
</p>
<p>poker.&#8221;
&#8220;Sir Eustace Brackenstall, the driver tells me.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly&#8212;one of the richest men in Kent. Lady
</p>
<p>Brackenstall is in the morning-room. Poor lady,
she has had a most dreadful experience. She
seemed half dead when I saw her first. I think you
had best see her and hear her account of the facts.
Then we will examine the dining-room together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. Sel-
dom have I seen so graceful a figure, so wom-
anly a presence, and so beautiful a face. She was
a blonde, golden-haired, blue-eyed, and would,
no doubt, have had the perfect complexion which
goes with such colouring had not her recent ex-
perience left her drawn and haggard. Her suffer-
ings were physical as well as mental, for over one
eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling, which
her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing as-
siduously with vinegar and water. The lady lay
back exhausted upon a couch, but her quick, ob-
servant gaze as we entered the room, and the alert
expression of her beautiful features, showed that
neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken
by her terrible experience. She was enveloped in a
loose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black
sequin-covered dinner-dress was hung upon the
couch beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you all that happened, Mr. Hop-
kins,&#8221; she said, wearily; &#8220;could you not repeat it
for me? Well, if you think it necessary, I will tell
these gentlemen what occurred. Have they been in
the dining-room yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought they had better hear your ladyship&#8217;s
story first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad when you can arrange matters.
It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there.&#8221;
She shuddered and buried her face in her hands.
As she did so the loose gown fell back from her
forearms. Holmes uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have other injuries, madam! What is
this?&#8221; Two vivid red spots stood out on one of the
white, round limbs. She hastily covered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing. It has no connection with the
hideous business of last night. If you and your
friend will sit down I will tell you all I can.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. I
have been married about a year. I suppose that it
is no use my attempting to conceal that our mar-
riage has not been a happy one. I fear that all
our neighbours would tell you that, even if I were
to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault may be
</p>
<p>partly mine. I was brought up in the freer, less
conventional atmosphere of South Australia, and
this English life, with its proprieties and its prim-
ness, is not congenial to me. But the main reason
lies in the one fact which is notorious to every-
one, and that is that Sir Eustace was a confirmed
drunkard. To be with such a man for an hour is
unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for
a sensitive and high-spirited woman to be tied to
him for day and night? It is a sacrilege, a crime, a
villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. I
say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring
a curse upon the land&#8212;Heaven will not let such
wickedness endure.&#8221; For an instant she sat up, her
cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under
the terrible mark upon her brow. Then the strong,
soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head
down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died
away into passionate sobbing. At last she contin-
ued:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you about last night. You are aware,
perhaps, that in this house all servants sleep in the
modern wing. This central block is made up of the
dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our
bedroom above. My maid Theresa sleeps above
my room. There is no one else, and no sound
could alarm those who are in the farther wing.
This must have been well known to the robbers,
or they would not have acted as they did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The
servants had already gone to their quarters. Only
my maid was up, and she had remained in her
room at the top of the house until I needed her
services. I sat until after eleven in this room, ab-
sorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that
all was right before I went upstairs. It was my cus-
tom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir
Eustace was not always to be trusted. I went into
the kitchen, the butler&#8217;s pantry, the gun-room, the
billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the
dining-room. As I approached the window, which
is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the
wind blow upon my face and realized that it was
open. I flung the curtain aside and found myself
face to face with a broad-shouldered, elderly man
who had just stepped into the room. The window
is a long French one, which really forms a door
leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle
lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first
man I saw two others, who were in the act of en-
tering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me
in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and
then by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream,
but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over
the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have
</p>
<p>560</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I
came to myself I found that they had torn down
the bell-rope and had secured me tightly to the
oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-
room table. I was so firmly bound that I could not
move, and a handkerchief round my mouth pre-
vented me from uttering any sound. It was at this
instant that my unfortunate husband entered the
room. He had evidently heard some suspicious
sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as
he found. He was dressed in his shirt and trousers,
with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand.
He rushed at one of the burglars, but another&#8212;it
was the elderly man&#8212;stooped, picked the poker
out of the grate, and struck him a horrible blow
as he passed. He fell without a groan, and never
moved again. I fainted once more, but again it
could only have been a very few minutes during
which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes
I found that they had collected the silver from the
sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine
which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his
hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one
was elderly, with a beard, and the others young,
hairless lads. They might have been a father with
his two sons. They talked together in whispers.
Then they came over and made sure that I was
still securely bound. Finally they withdrew, clos-
ing the window after them. It was quite a quarter
of an hour before I got my mouth free. When I
did so my screams brought the maid to my assis-
tance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and
we sent for the local police, who instantly com-
municated with London. That is really all that I
can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not
be necessary for me to go over so painful a story
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any questions, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; asked Hopkins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not impose any further tax upon Lady
Brackenstall&#8217;s patience and time,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Before I go into the dining-room I should like to
hear your experience.&#8221; He looked at the maid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the men before ever they came into the
house,&#8221; said she. &#8220;As I sat by my bedroom win-
dow I saw three men in the moonlight down by
the lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it
at the time. It was more than an hour after that I
heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find
her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the
floor with his blood and brains over the room. It
was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied
there, and her very dress spotted with him; but she
never wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of
Adelaide, and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange
</p>
<p>hasn&#8217;t learned new ways. You&#8217;ve questioned her
long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is com-
ing to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to
get the rest that she badly needs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman
put her arm round her mistress and led her from
the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been with her all her life,&#8221; said Hop-
kins. &#8220;Nursed her as a baby, and came with her
to England when they first left Australia eighteen
months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the
kind of maid you don&#8217;t pick up nowadays. This
way, Mr. Holmes, if you please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The keen interest had passed out of Holmes&#8217;s
expressive face, and I knew that with the mystery
all the charm of the case had departed. There still
remained an arrest to be effected, but what were
these commonplace rogues that he should soil his
hands with them? An abstruse and learned spe-
cialist who finds that he has been called in for a
case of measles would experience something of the
annoyance which I read in my friend&#8217;s eyes. Yet
the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange
was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and
to recall his waning interest.
</p>
<p>It was a very large and high chamber, with
carved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a fine ar-
ray of deer&#8217;s heads and ancient weapons around
the walls. At the farther end from the door was
the high French window of which we had heard.
Three smaller windows on the right-hand side
filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. On
the left was a large, deep fireplace, with a mas-
sive, over-hanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the
fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and
cross-bars at the bottom. In and out through the
open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which
was secured at each side to the crosspiece below.
In releasing the lady the cord had been slipped off
her, but the knots with which it had been secured
still remained. These details only struck our at-
tention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely
absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the
tiger-skin hearthrug in front of the fire.
</p>
<p>It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about
forty years of age. He lay upon his back, his face
upturned, with his white teeth grinning through
his short black beard. His two clenched hands
were raised above his head, and a heavy black-
thorn stick lay across them. His dark, handsome,
aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of
vindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in
a terribly fiendish expression. He had evidently
been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for
</p>
<p>561</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Abbey Grange
</p>
<p>he wore a foppish embroidered night-shirt, and his
bare feet projected from his trousers. His head was
horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness
to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck
him down. Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent
into a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined
both it and the indescribable wreck which it had
wrought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be a powerful man, this elder Ran-
dall,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Hopkins. &#8220;I have some record of
the fellow, and he is a rough customer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have no difficulty in getting him.&#8221;
&#8220;Not the slightest. We have been on the look-
</p>
<p>out for him, and there was some idea that he had
got away to America. Now that we know the gang
are here I don&#8217;t see how they can escape. We have
the news at every seaport already, and a reward
will be offered before evening. What beats me is
how they could have done so mad a thing, know-
ing that the lady could describe them, and that we
could not fail to recognise the description.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. One would have expected that they
would have silenced Lady Brackenstall as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They may not have realized,&#8221; I suggested,
&#8220;that she had recovered from her faint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is likely enough. If she seemed to be
senseless they would not take her life. What about
this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have heard
some queer stories about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good-hearted man when he was
sober, but a perfect fiend when he was drunk, or
rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom re-
ally went the whole way. The devil seemed to be
in him at such times, and he was capable of any-
thing. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth
and his title, he very nearly came our way once or
twice. There was a scandal about his drenching a
dog with petroleum and setting it on fire&#8212;her la-
dyship&#8217;s dog, to make the matter worse&#8212;and that
was only hushed up with difficulty. Then he threw
a decanter at that maid, Theresa Wright; there was
trouble about that. On the whole, and between
ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him.
What are you looking at now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was down on his knees examining
with great attention the knots upon the red cord
with which the lady had been secured. Then he
carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end
where it had snapped off when the burglar had
dragged it down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When this was pulled down the bell in the
kitchen must have rung loudly,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right
at the back of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the burglar know no one would hear
it? How dared he pull at a bell-rope in that reck-
less fashion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the
very question which I have asked myself again
and again. There can be no doubt that this fel-
low must have known the house and its habits. He
must have perfectly understood that the servants
would all be in bed at that comparatively early
hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell
ring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been
in close league with one of the servants. Surely
that is evident. But there are eight servants, and
all of good character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other things being equal,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;one
would suspect the one at whose head the mas-
ter threw a decanter. And yet that would in-
volve treachery towards the mistress to whom this
woman seems devoted. Well, well, the point is a
minor one, and when you have Randall you will
probably find no difficulty in securing his accom-
plice. The lady&#8217;s story certainly seems to be cor-
roborated, if it needed corroboration, by every de-
tail which we see before us.&#8221; He walked to the
French window and threw it open. &#8220;There are no
signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one
would not expect them. I see that these candles on
the mantelpiece have been lighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it was by their light and that of the lady&#8217;s
bedroom candle that the burglars saw their way
about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did they take?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they did not take much&#8212;only half-a-
dozen articles of plate off the sideboard. Lady
Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so
disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they
did not ransack the house as they would otherwise
have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt that is true. And yet they drank
some wine, I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To steady their own nerves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. These three glasses upon the side-
board have been untouched, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and the bottle stands as they left it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us look at it. Halloa! halloa! what is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three glasses were grouped together, all
of them tinged with wine, and one of them con-
taining some dregs of bees-wing. The bottle stood
near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long,
deeply-stained cork. Its appearance and the dust
</p>
<p>562</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>upon the bottle showed that it was no common
vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.
</p>
<p>A change had come over Holmes&#8217;s manner. He
had lost his listless expression, and again I saw an
alert light of interest in his keen, deep-set eyes. He
raised the cork and examined it minutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did they draw it?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it
lay some table linen and a large cork-screw.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was
used?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you remember that she was senseless at
the moment when the bottle was opened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. As a matter of fact that screw was
not used. This bottle was opened by a pocket-
screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more
than an inch and a half long. If you examine the
top of the cork you will observe that the screw
was driven in three times before the cork was ex-
tracted. It has never been transfixed. This long
screw would have transfixed it and drawn it with
a single pull. When you catch this fellow you will
find that he has one of these multiplex knives in
his possession.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Hopkins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess.
Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men
drinking, did she not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she was clear about that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is an end of it. What more is to
be said? And yet you must admit that the three
glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What, you
see nothing remarkable! Well, well, let it pass. Per-
haps when a man has special knowledge and spe-
cial powers like my own it rather encourages him
to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one
is at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance
about the glasses. Well, good morning, Hopkins. I
don&#8217;t see that I can be of any use to you, and you
appear to have your case very clear. You will let
me know when Randall is arrested, and any fur-
ther developments which may occur. I trust that
I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a suc-
cessful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we
may employ ourselves more profitably at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During our return journey I could see by
Holmes&#8217;s face that he was much puzzled by some-
thing which he had observed. Every now and
then, by an effort, he would throw off the impres-
sion and talk as if the matter were clear, but then
his doubts would settle down upon him again, and
his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show
</p>
<p>that his thoughts had gone back once more to the
great dining-room of the Abbey Grange in which
this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last,
by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawl-
ing out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the
platform and pulled me out after him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, my dear fellow,&#8221; said he, as we
watched the rear carriages of our train disappear-
ing round a curve; &#8220;I am sorry to make you the
victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my
life, Watson, I simply can&#8217;t leave that case in this
condition. Every instinct that I possess cries out
against it. It&#8217;s wrong&#8212;it&#8217;s all wrong&#8212;I&#8217;ll swear
that it&#8217;s wrong. And yet the lady&#8217;s story was com-
plete, the maid&#8217;s corroboration was sufficient, the
detail was fairly exact. What have I to put against
that? Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had
not taken things for granted, if I had examined ev-
erything with care which I would have shown had
we approached the case de novo and had no cut-
and-dried story to warp my mind, would I not
then have found something more definite to go
upon? Of course I should. Sit down on this bench,
Watson, until a train for Chislehurst arrives, and
allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring
you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind
the idea that anything which the maid or her mis-
tress may have said must necessarily be true. The
lady&#8217;s charming personality must not be permitted
to warp our judgment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely there are details in her story which, if
we looked at it in cold blood, would excite our sus-
picion. These burglars made a considerable haul at
Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them
and of their appearance was in the papers, and
would naturally occur to anyone who wished to
invent a story in which imaginary robbers should
play a part. As a matter of fact, burglars who have
done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only
too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet
without embarking on another perilous undertak-
ing. Again, it is unusual for burglars to operate
at so early an hour; it is unusual for burglars to
strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one
would imagine that was the sure way to make her
scream; it is unusual for them to commit murder
when their numbers are sufficient to overpower
one man; it is unusual for them to be content with
a limited plunder when there is much more within
their reach; and finally I should say that it was very
unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty.
How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their cumulative effect is certainly consider-
able, and yet each of them is quite possible in it-
</p>
<p>563</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Abbey Grange
</p>
<p>self. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to
me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am not so clear about that, Watson; for
it is evident that they must either kill her or else
secure her in such a way that she could not give
immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I
have shown, have I not, that there is a certain ele-
ment of improbability about the lady&#8217;s story? And
now on the top of this comes the incident of the
wine-glasses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the wine-glasses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see them in your mind&#8217;s eye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see them clearly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told that three men drank from them.
Does that strike you as likely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? There was wine in each glass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly; but there was bees-wing only in one
glass. You must have noticed that fact. What does
that suggest to your mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last glass filled would be most likely to
contain bees-wing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is
inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear
and the third heavily charged with it. There are
two possible explanations, and only two. One is
that after the second glass was filled the bottle was
violently agitated, and so the third glass received
the bees-wing. That does not appear probable. No,
no; I am sure that I am right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, then, do you suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That only two glasses were used, and that the
dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as
to give the false impression that three people had
been here. In that way all the bees-wing would be
in the last glass, would it not? Yes, I am convinced
that this is so. But if I have hit upon the true ex-
planation of this one small phenomenon, then in
an instant the case rises from the commonplace to
the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean
that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliber-
ately lied to us, that not one word of their story
is to be believed, that they have some very strong
reason for covering the real criminal, and that we
must construct our case for ourselves without any
help from them. That is the mission which now
lies before us, and here, Watson, is the Chislehurst
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The household of the Abbey Grange were
much surprised at our return, but Sherlock
Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone
off to report to head-quarters, took possession of
the dining-room, locked the door upon the inside,
</p>
<p>and devoted himself for two hours to one of those
minute and laborious investigations which formed
the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of de-
duction were reared. Seated in a corner like an
interested student who observes the demonstra-
tion of his professor, I followed every step of that
remarkable research. The window, the curtains,
the carpet, the chair, the rope&#8212;each in turn was
minutely examined and duly pondered. The body
of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, but
all else remained as we had seen it in the morning.
Then, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on
to the massive mantelpiece. Far above his head
hung the few inches of red cord which were still
attached to the wire. For a long time he gazed up-
ward at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it
he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the
wall. This brought his hand within a few inches
of the broken end of the rope, but it was not this
so much as the bracket itself which seemed to en-
gage his attention. Finally he sprang down with
an ejaculation of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We have got
our case&#8212;one of the most remarkable in our col-
lection. But, dear me, how slow-witted I have
been, and how nearly I have committed the blun-
der of my lifetime! Now, I think that with a few
missing links my chain is almost complete.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got your men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, Watson, man. Only one, but a very
formidable person. Strong as a lion&#8212;witness the
blow that bent that poker. Six foot three in height,
active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers; fi-
nally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole in-
genious story is of his concoction. Yes, Watson, we
have come upon the handiwork of a very remark-
able individual. And yet in that bell-rope he has
given us a clue which should not have left us a
doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was the clue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope,
Watson, where would you expect it to break?
Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire.
Why should it break three inches from the top as
this one has done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is frayed there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. This end, which we can examine, is
frayed. He was cunning enough to do that with his
knife. But the other end is not frayed. You could
not observe that from here, but if you were on the
mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off
without any mark of fraying whatever. You can
reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the
</p>
<p>564</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giv-
ing the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do?
He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite
reach it, put his knee on the bracket&#8212;you will see
the impression in the dust&#8212;and so got his knife to
bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by
at least three inches, from which I infer that he is
at least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at
that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! What
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the
lady&#8217;s story out of court. If she were seated on
the chair when the crime was done, how comes
that mark? No, no; she was placed in the chair
after the death of her husband. I&#8217;ll wager that the
black dress shows a corresponding mark to this.
We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but
this is our Marengo, for it begins in defeat and
ends in victory. I should like now to have a few
words with the nurse Theresa. We must be wary
for awhile, if we are to get the information which
we want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was an interesting person, this stern Aus-
tralian nurse. Taciturn, suspicious, ungracious, it
took some time before Holmes&#8217;s pleasant manner
and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed
her into a corresponding amiability. She did not
attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter
at me. I heard him call my mistress a name, and
I told him that he would not dare to speak so if
her brother had been there. Then it was that he
threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if
he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was for
ever illtreating her, and she too proud to complain.
She will not even tell me all that he has done to
her. She never told me of those marks on her arm
that you saw this morning, but I know very well
that they come from a stab with a hat-pin. The sly
fiend&#8212;Heaven forgive me that I should speak of
him so, now that he is dead, but a fiend he was
if ever one walked the earth. He was all honey
when first we met him, only eighteen months ago,
and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She
had only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her
first voyage&#8212;she had never been from home be-
fore. He won her with his title and his money and
his false London ways. If she made a mistake she
has paid for it, if ever a woman did. What month
did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was just after
we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July.
They were married in January of last year. Yes, she
is down in the morning-room again, and I have no
</p>
<p>doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too
much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh
and blood will stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lady Brackenstall was reclining on the same
couch, but looked brighter than before. The maid
had entered with us, and began once more to fo-
ment the bruise upon her mistress&#8217;s brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;that you have not come
to cross-examine me again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice,
&#8220;I will not cause you any unnecessary trouble,
Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make
things easy for you, for I am convinced that you
are a much-tried woman. If you will treat me as a
friend and trust me you may find that I will justify
your trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;
&#8220;To tell me the truth.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, Lady Brackenstall, it is no use. You
</p>
<p>may have heard of any little reputation which I
possess. I will stake it all on the fact that your
story is an absolute fabrication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mistress and maid were both staring at Holmes
with pale faces and frightened eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an impudent fellow!&#8221; cried Theresa.
&#8220;Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a
lie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rose from his chair.
&#8220;Have you nothing to tell me?&#8221;
&#8220;I have told you everything.&#8221;
&#8220;Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. Would it
</p>
<p>not be better to be frank?&#8221;
For an instant there was hesitation in her beau-
</p>
<p>tiful face. Then some new strong thought caused
it to set like a mask.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you all I know.&#8221;
Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoul-
</p>
<p>ders. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said, and without another
word we left the room and the house. There was a
pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way.
It was frozen over, but a single hole was left for the
convenience of a solitary swan. Holmes gazed at
it and then passed on to the lodge gate. There he
scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins and left
it with the lodge-keeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a hit or it may be a miss, but we are
bound to do something for friend Hopkins, just to
justify this second visit,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I will not quite
take him into my confidence yet. I think our next
scene of operations must be the shipping office of
the Adelaide-Southampton line, which stands at
the end of Pall Mall, if I remember right. There is a
</p>
<p>565</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Abbey Grange
</p>
<p>second line of steamers which connect South Aus-
tralia with England, but we will draw the larger
cover first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s card sent in to the manager ensured
instant attention, and he was not long in acquiring
all the information which he needed. In June of
&#8217;95 only one of their line had reached a home port.
It was the Rock of Gibraltar, their largest and best
boat. A reference to the passenger list showed that
Miss Fraser of Adelaide, with her maid, had made
the voyage in her. The boat was now on her way
to Australia, somewhere to the south of the Suez
Canal. Her officers were the same as in &#8217;95, with
one exception. The first officer, Mr. Jack Croker,
had been made a captain and was to take charge of
their new ship, the Bass Rock, sailing in two days&#8217;
time from Southampton. He lived at Sydenham,
but he was likely to be in that morning for instruc-
tions, if we cared to wait for him.
</p>
<p>No; Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but
would be glad to know more about his record and
character.
</p>
<p>His record was magnificent. There was not an
officer in the fleet to touch him. As to his character,
he was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fel-
low off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable,
but loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the
pith of the information with which Holmes left
the office of the Adelaide-Southampton company.
Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but instead of
entering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn
down, lost in profound thought. Finally he drove
round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent
off a message, and then, at last, we made for Baker
Street once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t do it, Watson,&#8221; said he, as
we re-entered our room. &#8220;Once that warrant was
made out nothing on earth would save him. Once
or twice in my career I feel that I have done more
real harm by my discovery of the criminal than
ever he had done by his crime. I have learned cau-
tion now, and I had rather play tricks with the law
of England than with my own conscience. Let us
know a little more before we act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before evening we had a visit from Inspector
Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well
with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes.
I really do sometimes think that you have powers
that are not human. Now, how on earth could you
know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of
that pond?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you told me to examine it.&#8221;
&#8220;You got it, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I got it.&#8221;
&#8220;I am very glad if I have helped you.&#8221;
&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t helped me. You have made
</p>
<p>the affair far more difficult. What sort of burglars
are they who steal silver and then throw it into the
nearest pond?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. I
was merely going on the idea that if the silver
had been taken by persons who did not want it,
who merely took it for a blind as it were, then they
would naturally be anxious to get rid of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should such an idea cross your
mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought it was possible. When they
came out through the French window there was
the pond, with one tempting little hole in the ice,
right in front of their noses. Could there be a better
hiding-place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, a hiding-place&#8212;that is better!&#8221; cried Stan-
ley Hopkins. &#8220;Yes, yes, I see it all now! It was
early, there were folk upon the roads, they were
afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank
it in the pond, intending to return for it when the
coast was clear. Excellent, Mr. Holmes&#8212;that is bet-
ter than your idea of a blind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so; you have got an admirable theory. I
have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild,
but you must admit that they have ended in dis-
covering the silver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, yes. It was all your doing. But I have
had a bad set-back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A set-back?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were ar-
</p>
<p>rested in New York this morning.&#8221;
&#8220;Dear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather
</p>
<p>against your theory that they committed a murder
in Kent last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is fatal, Mr. Holmes, absolutely fatal. Still,
there are other gangs of three besides the Randalls,
or it may be some new gang of which the police
have never heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so; it is perfectly possible. What, are
you off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Holmes; there is no rest for me until
I have got to the bottom of the business. I suppose
you have no hint to give me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given you one.&#8221;
&#8220;Which?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I suggested a blind.&#8221;
&#8220;But why, Mr. Holmes, why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>566</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the question, of course. But I com-
mend the idea to your mind. You might possibly
find that there was something in it. You won&#8217;t stop
for dinner? Well, good-bye, and let us know how
you get on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dinner was over and the table cleared before
Holmes alluded to the matter again. He had lit
his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful
blaze of the fire. Suddenly he looked at his watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect developments, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8212;within a few minutes. I dare say you
thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins
just now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust your judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look
at it this way: what I know is unofficial; what he
knows is official. I have the right to private judg-
ment, but he has none. He must disclose all, or
he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case I
would not put him in so painful a position, and
so I reserve my information until my own mind is
clear upon the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But when will that be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The time has come. You will now be present
at the last scene of a remarkable little drama.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sound upon the stairs, and our
door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of
manhood as ever passed through it. He was a
very tall young man, golden-moustached, blue-
eyed, with a skin which had been burned by trop-
ical suns, and a springy step which showed that
the huge frame was as active as it was strong. He
closed the door behind him, and then he stood
with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking
down some overmastering emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Captain Croker. You got my tele-
gram?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor sank into an arm-chair and looked
from one to the other of us with questioning eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got your telegram, and I came at the hour
you said. I heard that you had been down to the
office. There was no getting away from you. Let&#8217;s
hear the worst. What are you going to do with me?
Arrest me? Speak out, man! You can&#8217;t sit there and
play with me like a cat with a mouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him a cigar,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Bite on
that, Captain Croker, and don&#8217;t let your nerves run
away with you. I should not sit here smoking with
you if I thought that you were a common criminal,
you may be sure of that. Be frank with me, and we
</p>
<p>may do some good. Play tricks with me, and I&#8217;ll
crush you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you wish me to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To give me a true account of all that happened
at the Abbey Grange last night&#8212;a true account,
mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken
off. I know so much already that if you go one
inch off the straight I&#8217;ll blow this police whistle
from my window and the affair goes out of my
hands for ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sailor thought for a little. Then he struck
his leg with his great, sun-burned hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chance it,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I believe you are a
man of your word, and a white man, and I&#8217;ll tell
you the whole story. But one thing I will say first.
So far as I am concerned I regret nothing and I fear
nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud
of the job. Curse the beast, if he had as many lives
as a cat he would owe them all to me! But it&#8217;s the
lady, Mary&#8212;Mary Fraser&#8212;for never will I call her
by that accursed name. When I think of getting
her into trouble, I who would give my life just to
bring one smile to her dear face, it&#8217;s that that turns
my soul into water. And yet&#8212;and yet&#8212;what less
could I do? I&#8217;ll tell you my story, gentlemen, and
then I&#8217;ll ask you as man to man what less could I
do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back a bit. You seem to know ev-
erything, so I expect that you know that I met her
when she was a passenger and I was first officer
of the Rock of Gibraltar. From the first day I met
her she was the only woman to me. Every day
of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time
since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the
night watch and kissed the deck of that ship be-
cause I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was
never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as
ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint
to make. It was all love on my side, and all good
comradeship and friendship on hers. When we
parted she was a free woman, but I could never
again be a free man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time I came back from sea I heard of her
marriage. Well, why shouldn&#8217;t she marry whom
she liked? Title and money&#8212;who could carry
them better than she? She was born for all that
is beautiful and dainty. I didn&#8217;t grieve over her
marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as that. I
just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and
that she had not thrown herself away on a penni-
less sailor. T
