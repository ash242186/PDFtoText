<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>H</p>
<p>olmes had been seated for some hours in
silence with his long, thin back curved
over a chemical vessel in which he
was brewing a particularly malodorous
</p>
<p>product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and
he looked from my point of view like a strange,
lank bird, with dull grey plumage and a black top-
knot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Watson,&#8221; said he, suddenly, &#8220;you do not
propose to invest in South African securities?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as
I was to Holmes&#8217;s curious faculties, this sudden
intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was ut-
terly inexplicable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth do you know that?&#8221; I asked.
He wheeled round upon his stool, with a
</p>
<p>steaming test-tube in his hand and a gleam of
amusement in his deep-set eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken
aback,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
&#8220;I ought to make you sign a paper to that ef-
</p>
<p>fect.&#8221;
&#8220;Why?&#8221;
&#8220;Because in five minutes you will say that it is
</p>
<p>all so absurdly simple.&#8221;
&#8220;I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.&#8221;
&#8220;You see, my dear Watson&#8221;&#8212;he propped his
</p>
<p>test-tube in the rack and began to lecture with
the air of a professor addressing his class&#8212;&#8220;it is
not really difficult to construct a series of infer-
ences, each dependent upon its predecessor and
each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply
knocks out all the central inferences and presents
one&#8217;s audience with the starting-point and the con-
clusion, one may produce a startling, though pos-
sibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was not really
difficult, by an inspection of the groove between
your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that
you did not propose to invest your small capital in
the goldfields.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no connection.&#8221;
&#8220;Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a
</p>
<p>close connection. Here are the missing links of the
very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between your
left finger and thumb when you returned from the
club last night. 2. You put chalk there when you
play billiards to steady the cue. 3. You never play
billiards except with Thurston. 4. You told me four
weeks ago that Thurston had an option on some
South African property which would expire in a
month, and which he desired you to share with
</p>
<p>him. 5. Your cheque-book is locked in my drawer,
and you have not asked for the key. 6. You do not
propose to invest your money in this manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How absurdly simple!&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so!&#8221; said he, a little nettled. &#8220;Every
problem becomes very childish when once it is ex-
plained to you. Here is an unexplained one. See
what you can make of that, friend Watson.&#8221; He
tossed a sheet of paper upon the table and turned
once more to his chemical analysis.
</p>
<p>I looked with amazement at the absurd hiero-
glyphics upon the paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Holmes, it is a child&#8217;s drawing,&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s your idea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else should it be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Ridling
Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is very anxious to know.
This little conundrum came by the first post, and
he was to follow by the next train. There&#8217;s a ring
at the bell, Watson. I should not be very much
surprised if this were he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and
an instant later there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-
shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and florid
cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker
Street. He seemed to bring a whiff of his strong,
fresh, bracing, east-coast air with him as he en-
tered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he
was about to sit down when his eye rested upon
the paper with the curious markings, which I had
just examined and left upon the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of
these?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They told me that you were fond
of queer mysteries, and I don&#8217;t think you can find
a queerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead
so that you might have time to study it before I
came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly rather a curious production,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;At first sight it would appear to
be some childish prank. It consists of a number of
absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon
which they are drawn. Why should you attribute
any importance to so grotesque an object?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife
does. It is frightening her to death. She says noth-
ing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That&#8217;s why I
want to sift the matter to the bottom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight
shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a note-
book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran
in this way:&#8212;
</p>
<p>447</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men
</p>
<p>Holmes examined it for some time, and then,
folding it carefully up, he placed it in his pocket-
book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This promises to be a most interesting and un-
usual case,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You gave me a few particu-
lars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I should
be very much obliged if you would kindly go over
it all again for the benefit of my friend, Dr. Wat-
son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much of a story-teller,&#8221; said our vis-
itor, nervously clasping and unclasping his great,
strong hands. &#8220;You&#8217;ll just ask me anything that I
don&#8217;t make clear. I&#8217;ll begin at the time of my mar-
riage last year; but I want to say first of all that,
though I&#8217;m not a rich man, my people have been
at Ridling Thorpe for a matter of five centuries,
and there is no better known family in the County
of Norfolk. Last year I came up to London for the
Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in Rus-
sell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish,
was staying in it. There was an American young
lady there&#8212;Patrick was the name&#8212;Elsie Patrick.
In some way we became friends, until before my
month was up I was as much in love as a man
could be. We were quietly married at a registry
office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded cou-
ple. You&#8217;ll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a
man of a good old family should marry a wife in
this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her
people; but if you saw her and knew her it would
help you to understand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I
can&#8217;t say that she did not give me every chance of
getting out of it if I wished to do so. &#8216;I have had
some very disagreeable associations in my life,&#8217;
said she; &#8216;I wish to forget all about them. I would
rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful
to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a
woman who has nothing that she need be person-
ally ashamed of; but you will have to be content
with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent
as to all that passed up to the time when I became
yours. If these conditions are too hard, then go
back to Norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in
which you found me.&#8217; It was only the day before
our wedding that she said those very words to me.
I told her that I was content to take her on her own
terms, and I have been as good as my word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have been married now for a year,
and very happy we have been. But about a month
ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time signs
</p>
<p>of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from
America. I saw the American stamp. She turned
deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the
fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and
I made none, for a promise is a promise; but she
has never known an easy hour from that moment.
There is always a look of fear upon her face&#8212;a
look as if she were waiting and expecting. She
would do better to trust me. She would find that
I was her best friend. But until she speaks I can
say nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman,
Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble there may have
been in her past life it has been no fault of hers. I
am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not
a man in England who ranks his family honour
more highly than I do. She knows it well, and she
knew it well before she married me. She would
never bring any stain upon it&#8212;of that I am sure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now I come to the queer part of my
story. About a week ago&#8212;it was the Tuesday of
last week&#8212;I found on one of the window-sills a
number of absurd little dancing figures, like these
upon the paper. They were scrawled with chalk. I
thought that it was the stable-boy who had drawn
them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it.
Anyhow, they had come there during the night.
I had them washed out, and I only mentioned
the matter to my wife afterwards. To my sur-
prise she took it very seriously, and begged me
if any more came to let her see them. None did
come for a week, and then yesterday morning I
found this paper lying on the sun-dial in the gar-
den. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped
in a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a
woman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror al-
ways lurking in her eyes. It was then that I wrote
and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was
not a thing that I could take to the police, for they
would have laughed at me, but you will tell me
what to do. I am not a rich man; but if there is
any danger threatening my little woman I would
spend my last copper to shield her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a fine creature, this man of the old En-
glish soil, simple, straight, and gentle, with his
great, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face.
His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in
his features. Holmes had listened to his story with
the utmost attention, and now he sat for some time
in silent thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Mr. Cubitt,&#8221; said he, at last,
&#8220;that your best plan would be to make a direct ap-
peal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret
with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hilton Cubitt shook his massive head.
</p>
<p>448</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie
wished to tell me she would. If not, it is not for me
to force her confidence. But I am justified in taking
my own line&#8212;and I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will help you with all my heart. In the
first place, have you heard of any strangers being
seen in your neighbourhood?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any
fresh face would cause comment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But
we have several small watering-places not very far
away. And the farmers take in lodgers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These hieroglyphics have evidently a mean-
ing. If it is a purely arbitrary one it may be impos-
sible for us to solve it. If, on the other hand, it is
systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the
bottom of it. But this particular sample is so short
that I can do nothing, and the facts which you have
brought me are so indefinite that we have no ba-
sis for an investigation. I would suggest that you
return to Norfolk, that you keep a keen look-out,
and that you take an exact copy of any fresh danc-
ing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities
that we have not a reproduction of those which
were done in chalk upon the window-sill. Make
a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the
neighbourhood. When you have collected some
fresh evidence come to me again. That is the best
advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt. If
there are any pressing fresh developments I shall
be always ready to run down and see you in your
Norfolk home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The interview left Sherlock Holmes very
thoughtful, and several times in the next few days
I saw him take his slip of paper from his note-book
and look long and earnestly at the curious figures
inscribed upon it. He made no allusion to the af-
fair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so
later. I was going out when he called me back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better stay here, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this
morning&#8212;you remember Hilton Cubitt, of the
dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street
at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment.
I gather from his wire that there have been some
new incidents of importance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire
came straight from the station as fast as a hansom
could bring him. He was looking worried and de-
pressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting on my nerves, this business, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he, as he sank, like a wearied man,
into an arm-chair. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough to feel that you
are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who
have some kind of design upon you; but when,
in addition to that, you know that it is just killing
your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as
flesh and blood can endure. She&#8217;s wearing away
under it&#8212;just wearing away before my eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she said anything yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there
have been times when the poor girl has wanted to
speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take
the plunge. I have tried to help her; but I dare say I
did it clumsily, and scared her off from it. She has
spoken about my old family, and our reputation in
the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour,
and I always felt it was leading to the point; but
somehow it turned off before we got there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have found out something for your-
self?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh
dancing men pictures for you to examine, and,
what is more important, I have seen the fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, the man who draws them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you
everything in order. When I got back after my visit
to you, the very first thing I saw next morning was
a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn
in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-
house, which stands beside the lawn in full view
of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and
here it is.&#8221; He unfolded a paper and laid it upon
the table. Here is a copy of the hieroglyphics:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Excellent! Pray con-
tinue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I had taken the copy I rubbed out the
marks; but two mornings later a fresh inscription
had appeared. I have a copy of it here&#8221;:&#8212;
</p>
<p>449</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men
</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with
delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our material is rapidly accumulating,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days later a message was left scrawled
upon paper, and placed under a pebble upon the
sun-dial. Here it is. The characters are, as you see,
exactly the same as the last one. After that I deter-
mined to lie in wait; so I got out my revolver and I
sat up in my study, which overlooks the lawn and
garden. About two in the morning I was seated by
the window, all being dark save for the moonlight
outside, when I heard steps behind me, and there
was my wife in her dressing-gown. She implored
me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished
to see who it was who played such absurd tricks
upon us. She answered that it was some senseless
practical joke, and that I should not take any notice
of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go
and travel, you and I, and so avoid this nuisance.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What, be driven out of our own house by a
practical joker?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Why, we should have the
whole county laughing at us.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, come to bed,&#8217; said she, &#8216;and we can dis-
cuss it in the morning.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face
grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand
tightened upon my shoulder. Something was mov-
ing in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark,
creeping figure which crawled round the corner
and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my pistol
I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms
round me and held me with convulsive strength.
I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most
desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I
had opened the door and reached the house the
creature was gone. He had left a trace of his pres-
ence, however, for there on the door was the very
same arrangement of dancing men which had al-
ready twice appeared, and which I have copied on
that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow
anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And
yet the amazing thing is that he must have been
there all the time, for when I examined the door
again in the morning he had scrawled some more
of his pictures under the line which I had already
seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you that fresh drawing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it is very short, but I made a copy of it,
and here it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he produced a paper. The new dance
was in this form:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Holmes&#8212;and I could see by his
eyes that he was much excited&#8212;&#8220;was this a mere
addition to the first, or did it appear to be entirely
separate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on a different panel of the door.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent! This is far the most important of all
</p>
<p>for our purpose. It fills me with hopes. Now, Mr.
Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most interest-
ing statement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, ex-
cept that I was angry with my wife that night for
having held me back when I might have caught
the skulking rascal. She said that she feared that I
might come to harm. For an instant it had crossed
my mind that perhaps what she really feared was
that he might come to harm, for I could not doubt
that she knew who this man was and what he
meant by these strange signals. But there is a
tone in my wife&#8217;s voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look
in her eyes which forbid doubt, and I am sure that
it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind.
There&#8217;s the whole case, and now I want your ad-
vice as to what I ought to do. My own inclination
is to put half-a-dozen of my farm lads in the shrub-
bery, and when this fellow comes again to give him
such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the
future.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear it is too deep a case for such simple
remedies,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;How long can you stay
in London?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back to-day. I would not leave my
wife alone all night for anything. She is very ner-
vous and begged me to come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say you are right. But if you could have
stopped I might possibly have been able to return
with you in a day or two. Meanwhile you will
leave me these papers, and I think that it is very
likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly
and to throw some light upon your case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm profes-
sional manner until our visitor had left us, al-
though it was easy for me, who knew him so well,
to see that he was profoundly excited. The mo-
ment that Hilton Cubitt&#8217;s broad back had disap-
peared through the door my comrade rushed to
the table, laid out all the slips of paper contain-
ing dancing men in front of him, and threw him-
self into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For
two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after
sheet of paper with figures and letters, so com-
pletely absorbed in his task that he had evidently
forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making
</p>
<p>450</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>progress and whistled and sang at his work; some-
times he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells
with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he
sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction,
and walked up and down the room rubbing his
hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram
upon a cable form. &#8220;If my answer to this is as I
hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to
your collection, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I expect that
we shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow,
and to take our friend some very definite news as
to the secret of his annoyance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I
was aware that Holmes liked to make his disclo-
sures at his own time and in his own way; so I
waited until it should suit him to take me into his
confidence.
</p>
<p>But there was a delay in that answering tele-
gram, and two days of impatience followed, dur-
ing which Holmes pricked up his ears at every
ring of the bell. On the evening of the second
there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All was
quiet with him, save that a long inscription had
appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the
sun-dial. He inclosed a copy of it, which is here
reproduced:&#8212;
</p>
<p>Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for
some minutes, and then suddenly sprang to his
feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay.
His face was haggard with anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have let this affair go far enough,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Is there a train to North Walsham to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I turned up the time-table. The last had just
gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall breakfast early and take the
very first in the morning,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Our
presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our
expected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson;
there may be an answer. No, that is quite as I ex-
pected. This message makes it even more essential
that we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton
Cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular
and a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk
squire is entangled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the
dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to
me to be only childish and bizarre I experience
once again the dismay and horror with which I
was filled. Would that I had some brighter end-
ing to communicate to my readers, but these are
the chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their
</p>
<p>dark crisis the strange chain of events which for
some days made Ridling Thorpe Manor a house-
hold word through the length and breadth of Eng-
land.
</p>
<p>We had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and
mentioned the name of our destination, when the
station-master hurried towards us. &#8220;I suppose that
you are the detectives from London?&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>A look of annoyance passed over Holmes&#8217;s
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think such a thing?&#8221;
&#8220;Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has
</p>
<p>just passed through. But maybe you are the sur-
geons. She&#8217;s not dead&#8212;or wasn&#8217;t by last accounts.
You may be in time to save her yet&#8212;though it be
for the gallows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s brow was dark with anxiety.
&#8220;We are going to Ridling Thorpe Manor,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>he, &#8220;but we have heard nothing of what has passed
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible business,&#8221; said the station-
master. &#8220;They are shot, both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and
his wife. She shot him and then herself&#8212;so the
servants say. He&#8217;s dead and her life is despaired of.
Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the County
of Norfolk, and one of the most honoured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage,
and during the long seven miles&#8217; drive he never
opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so ut-
terly despondent. He had been uneasy during all
our journey from town, and I had observed that
he had turned over the morning papers with anx-
ious attention; but now this sudden realization of
his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy. He
leaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation.
Yet there was much around to interest us, for we
were passing through as singular a country-side
as any in England, where a few scattered cottages
represented the population of to-day, while on ev-
ery hand enormous square-towered churches bris-
tled up from the flat, green landscape and told of
the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia. At last
the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over
the green edge of the Norfolk coast, and the driver
pointed with his whip to two old brick and tim-
ber gables which projected from a grove of trees.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Ridling Thorpe Manor,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>As we drove up to the porticoed front door I
observed in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the
black tool-house and the pedestalled sun-dial with
which we had such strange associations. A dapper
little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed
moustache, had just descended from a high dog-
cart. He introduced himself as Inspector Martin,
</p>
<p>451</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men
</p>
<p>of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was consid-
erably astonished when he heard the name of my
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only com-
mitted at three this morning. How could you hear
of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I anticipated it. I came in the hope of prevent-
ing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must have important evidence of
which we are ignorant, for they were said to be
a most united couple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only the evidence of the dancing men,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;I will explain the matter to you
later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent
this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use
the knowledge which I possess in order to ensure
that justice be done. Will you associate me in your
investigation, or will you prefer that I should act
independently?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be proud to feel that we were act-
ing together, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the inspector,
earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I should be glad to hear the evi-
dence and to examine the premises without an in-
stant of unnecessary delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow
my friend to do things in his own fashion, and
contented himself with carefully noting the results.
The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had
just come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt&#8217;s room,
and he reported that her injuries were serious,
but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed
through the front of her brain, and it would prob-
ably be some time before she could regain con-
sciousness. On the question of whether she had
been shot or had shot herself he would not ven-
ture to express any decided opinion. Certainly the
bullet had been discharged at very close quarters.
There was only the one pistol found in the room,
two barrels of which had been emptied. Mr. Hilton
Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was
equally conceivable that he had shot her and then
himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the
revolver lay upon the floor midway between them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been moved?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;We have moved nothing except the lady. We
</p>
<p>could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor.&#8221;
&#8220;How long have you been here, doctor?&#8221;
&#8220;Since four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
&#8220;Anyone else?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, the constable here.&#8221;
&#8220;And you have touched nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;You have acted with great discretion. Who
</p>
<p>sent for you?&#8221;
&#8220;The housemaid, Saunders.&#8221;
&#8220;Was it she who gave the alarm?&#8221;
&#8220;She and Mrs. King, the cook.&#8221;
&#8220;Where are they now?&#8221;
&#8220;In the kitchen, I believe.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I think we had better hear their story at
</p>
<p>once.&#8221;
The old hall, oak-panelled and high-
</p>
<p>windowed, had been turned into a court of in-
vestigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned
chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his hag-
gard face. I could read in them a set purpose to
devote his life to this quest until the client whom
he had failed to save should at last be avenged.
The trim Inspector Martin, the old, grey-headed
country doctor, myself, and a stolid village police-
man made up the rest of that strange company.
</p>
<p>The two women told their story clearly enough.
They had been aroused from their sleep by the
sound of an explosion, which had been followed a
minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoin-
ing rooms, and Mrs. King had rushed in to Saun-
ders. Together they had descended the stairs. The
door of the study was open and a candle was burn-
ing upon the table. Their master lay upon his face
in the centre of the room. He was quite dead. Near
the window his wife was crouching, her head lean-
ing against the wall. She was horribly wounded,
and the side of her face was red with blood. She
breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying any-
thing. The passage, as well as the room, was full
of smoke and the smell of powder. The window
was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside.
Both women were positive upon the point. They
had at once sent for the doctor and for the con-
stable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the
stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mis-
tress to her room. Both she and her husband had
occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress&#8212;he
in his dressing-gown, over his night clothes. Noth-
ing had been moved in the study. So far as they
knew there had never been any quarrel between
husband and wife. They had always looked upon
them as a very united couple.
</p>
<p>These were the main points of the servants&#8217; ev-
idence. In answer to Inspector Martin they were
clear that every door was fastened upon the in-
side, and that no one could have escaped from
the house. In answer to Holmes they both re-
membered that they were conscious of the smell
of powder from the moment that they ran out of
</p>
<p>452</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>their rooms upon the top floor. &#8220;I commend that
fact very carefully to your attention,&#8221; said Holmes
to his professional colleague. &#8220;And now I think
that we are in a position to undertake a thorough
examination of the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The study proved to be a small chamber, lined
on three sides with books, and with a writing-
table facing an ordinary window, which looked
out upon the garden. Our first attention was given
to the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge
frame lay stretched across the room. His dis-
ordered dress showed that he had been hastily
aroused from sleep. The bullet had been fired at
him from the front, and had remained in his body
after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly
been instantaneous and painless. There was no
powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or
on his hands. According to the country surgeon
the lady had stains upon her face, but none upon
her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The absence of the latter means nothing,
though its presence may mean everything,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Unless the powder from a badly-fitting
cartridge happens to spurt backwards, one may
fire many shots without leaving a sign. I would
suggest that Mr. Cubitt&#8217;s body may now be re-
moved. I suppose, doctor, you have not recovered
the bullet which wounded the lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A serious operation will be necessary before
that can be done. But there are still four car-
tridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and
two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be
accounted for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would seem,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Perhaps
you can account also for the bullet which has so
obviously struck the edge of the window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin fin-
ger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled
right through the lower window-sash about an
inch above the bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; cried the inspector. &#8220;How ever
did you see that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I looked for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; said the country doctor. &#8220;You are
certainly right, sir. Then a third shot has been
fired, and therefore a third person must have been
present. But who could that have been and how
could he have got away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the problem which we are now about
to solve,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;You remember,
Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on
leaving their room they were at once conscious of
</p>
<p>a smell of powder I remarked that the point was
an extremely important one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It suggested that at the time of the firing the
window as well as the door of the room had been
open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not
have been blown so rapidly through the house. A
draught in the room was necessary for that. Both
door and window were only open for a very short
time, however.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you prove that?&#8221;
&#8220;Because the candle has not guttered.&#8221;
&#8220;Capital!&#8221; cried the inspector. &#8220;Capital!&#8221;
&#8220;Feeling sure that the window had been open
</p>
<p>at the time of the tragedy I conceived that there
might have been a third person in the affair, who
stood outside this opening and fired through it.
Any shot directed at this person might hit the sash.
I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet
mark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how came the window to be shut and fas-
tened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman&#8217;s first instinct would be to shut
and fasten the window. But, halloa! what is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a lady&#8217;s hand-bag which stood upon the
study table&#8212;a trim little hand-bag of crocodile-
skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned the
contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes
of the Bank of England, held together by an india-
rubber band&#8212;nothing else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be preserved, for it will figure in
the trial,&#8221; said Holmes, as he handed the bag with
its contents to the inspector. &#8220;It is now necessary
that we should try to throw some light upon this
third bullet, which has clearly, from the splinter-
ing of the wood, been fired from inside the room.
I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again.
You said, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a
loud explosion. When you said that, did you mean
that it seemed to you to be louder than the second
one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, and
so it is hard to judge. But it did seem very loud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think that it might have been two
shots fired almost at the same instant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I couldn&#8217;t say, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather
</p>
<p>think, Inspector Martin, that we have now ex-
hausted all that this room can teach us. If you
will kindly step round with me, we shall see what
fresh evidence the garden has to offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flower-bed extended up to the study win-
dow, and we all broke into an exclamation as we
</p>
<p>453</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men
</p>
<p>approached it. The flowers were trampled down,
and the soft soil was imprinted all over with foot-
marks. Large, masculine feet they were, with pe-
culiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about
among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a
wounded bird. Then, with a cry of satisfaction, he
bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylin-
der.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said he; &#8220;the revolver had an
ejector, and here is the third cartridge. I really
think, Inspector Martin, that our case is almost
complete.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The country inspector&#8217;s face had shown his
intense amazement at the rapid and masterful
progress of Holmes&#8217;s investigation. At first he had
shown some disposition to assert his own posi-
tion; but now he was overcome with admiration
and ready to follow without question wherever
Holmes led.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go into that later. There are several points
</p>
<p>in this problem which I have not been able to ex-
plain to you yet. Now that I have got so far I had
best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the
whole matter up once and for all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we
get our man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is
impossible at the moment of action to enter into
long and complex explanations. I have the threads
of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady
should never recover consciousness we can still re-
construct the events of last night and ensure that
justice be done. First of all I wish to know whether
there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as
&#8216;Elrige&#8217;s&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The servants were cross-questioned, but none
of them had heard of such a place. The stable-boy
threw a light upon the matter by remembering that
a farmer of that name lived some miles off in the
direction of East Ruston.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a lonely farm?&#8221;
&#8220;Very lonely, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that
</p>
<p>happened here during the night?&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe not, sir.&#8221;
Holmes thought for a little and then a curious
</p>
<p>smile played over his face.
&#8220;Saddle a horse, my lad,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I shall wish
</p>
<p>you to take a note to Elrige&#8217;s Farm.&#8221;
He took from his pocket the various slips of
</p>
<p>the dancing men. With these in front of him he
</p>
<p>worked for some time at the study-table. Finally
he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put
it into the hands of the person to whom it was ad-
dressed, and especially to answer no questions of
any sort which might be put to him. I saw the
outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irreg-
ular characters, very unlike Holmes&#8217;s usual precise
hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elrige&#8217;s
Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, inspector,&#8221; Holmes remarked, &#8220;that
you would do well to telegraph for an escort, as, if
my calculations prove to be correct, you may have
a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the
county jail. The boy who takes this note could no
doubt forward your telegram. If there is an af-
ternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should
do well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis
of some interest to finish, and this investigation
draws rapidly to a close.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the youth had been dispatched with the
note, Sherlock Holmes gave his instructions to the
servants. If any visitor were to call asking for Mrs.
Hilton Cubitt no information should be given as
to her condition, but he was to be shown at once
into the drawing-room. He impressed these points
upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally
he led the way into the drawing-room with the re-
mark that the business was now out of our hands,
and that we must while away the time as best we
might until we could see what was in store for us.
The doctor had departed to his patients, and only
the inspector and myself remained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I can help you to pass an hour
in an interesting and profitable manner,&#8221; said
Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table and
spreading out in front of him the various papers
upon which were recorded the antics of the danc-
ing men. &#8220;As to you, friend Watson, I owe you
every atonement for having allowed your natural
curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied. To you,
inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a re-
markable professional study. I must tell you first
of all the interesting circumstances connected with
the previous consultations which Mr. Hilton Cu-
bitt has had with me in Baker Street.&#8221; He then
shortly recapitulated the facts which have already
been recorded. &#8220;I have here in front of me these
singular productions, at which one might smile
had they not proved themselves to be the fore-
runners of so terrible a tragedy. I am fairly famil-
iar with all forms of secret writings, and am my-
self the author of a trifling monograph upon the
subject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty
separate ciphers; but I confess that this is entirely
new to me. The object of those who invented the
</p>
<p>454</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>system has apparently been to conceal that these
characters convey a message, and to give the idea
that they are the mere random sketches of chil-
dren.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Having once recognised, however, that the
symbols stood for letters, and having applied the
rules which guide us in all forms of secret writ-
ings, the solution was easy enough. The first mes-
sage submitted to me was so short that it was im-
possible for me to do more than to say with some
confidence that the symbol
</p>
<p>stood for E. As you are aware, E is the most
common letter in the English alphabet, and it pre-
dominates to so marked an extent that even in a
short sentence one would expect to find it most
often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message
four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this
down as E. It is true that in some cases the figure
was bearing a flag and in some cases not, but it was
probable from the way in which the flags were dis-
tributed that they were used to break the sentence
up into words. I accepted this as a hypothesis, and
noted that E was represented by
</p>
<p>&#8220;But now came the real difficulty of the in-
quiry. The order of the English letters after E is
by no means well marked, and any preponderance
which may be shown in an average of a printed
sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence.
Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L
are the numerical order in which letters occur; but
T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other,
and it would be an endless task to try each combi-
nation until a meaning was arrived at. I, therefore,
waited for fresh material. In my second interview
with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two
other short sentences and one message, which ap-
peared&#8212;since there was no flag&#8212;to be a single
word. Here are the symbols. Now, in the single
word I have already got the two E&#8217;s coming sec-
ond and fourth in a word of five letters. It might be
&#8216;sever,&#8217; or &#8216;lever,&#8217; or &#8216;never.&#8217; There can be no ques-
tion that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the
most probable, and the circumstances pointed to
its being a reply written by the lady. Accepting it
as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols
</p>
<p>stand respectively for N, V, and R.
&#8220;Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but
</p>
<p>a happy thought put me in possession of several
</p>
<p>other letters. It occurred to me that if these appeals
came, as I expected, from someone who had been
intimate with the lady in her early life, a combina-
tion which contained two E&#8217;s with three letters be-
tween might very well stand for the name &#8216;ELSIE.&#8217;
On examination I found that such a combination
formed the termination of the message which was
three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal
to &#8216;Elsie.&#8217; In this way I had got my L, S, and I.
But what appeal could it be? There were only four
letters in the word which preceded &#8216;Elsie,&#8217; and it
ended in E. Surely the word must be &#8216;COME.&#8217; I
tried all other four letters ending in E, but could
find none to fit the case. So now I was in posses-
sion of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to
attack the first message once more, dividing it into
words and putting dots for each symbol which was
still unknown. So treated it worked out in this
fashion:
</p>
<p>.M .ERE ..E SL.NE.
&#8220;Now the first letter can only be A, which is a
most useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than
three times in this short sentence, and the H is also
apparent in the second word. Now it becomes:&#8212;
</p>
<p>AM HERE A.E SLANE.
Or, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:&#8212;
</p>
<p>AM HERE ABE SLANEY.
I had so many letters now that I could proceed
with considerable confidence to the second mes-
sage, which worked out in this fashion:&#8212;
</p>
<p>A. ELRI.ES.
Here I could only make sense by putting T and
G for the missing letters, and supposing that the
name was that of some house or inn at which the
writer was staying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inspector Martin and I had listened with the ut-
most interest to the full and clear account of how
my friend had produced results which had led to
so complete a command over our difficulties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do then, sir?&#8221; asked the inspec-
tor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had every reason to suppose that this Abe
Slaney was an American, since Abe is an Amer-
ican contraction, and since a letter from America
had been the starting-point of all the trouble. I
had also every cause to think that there was some
criminal secret in the matter. The lady&#8217;s allusions
to her past and her refusal to take her husband
into her confidence both pointed in that direction.
I therefore cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave,
of the New York Police Bureau, who has more than
once made use of my knowledge of London crime.
I asked him whether the name of Abe Slaney was
</p>
<p>455</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men
</p>
<p>known to him. Here is his reply: &#8216;The most dan-
gerous crook in Chicago.&#8217; On the very evening
upon which I had his answer Hilton Cubitt sent
me the last message from Slaney. Working with
known letters it took this form:&#8212;
</p>
<p>ELSIE .RE.ARE TO MEET THY GO.
</p>
<p>The addition of a P and a D completed a message
which showed me that the rascal was proceeding
from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of
the crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he
might very rapidly put his words into action. I
at once came to Norfolk with my friend and col-
league, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to
find that the worst had already occurred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a privilege to be associated with you in
the handling of a case,&#8221; said the inspector, warmly.
&#8220;You will excuse me, however, if I speak frankly to
you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I
have to answer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney,
living at Elrige&#8217;s, is indeed the murderer, and if
he has made his escape while I am seated here, I
should certainly get into serious trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not be uneasy. He will not try to
escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To fly would be a confession of guilt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us go to arrest him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect him here every instant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should he come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I have written and asked him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes! Why
should he come because you have asked him?
Would not such a request rather rouse his suspi-
cions and cause him to fly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have known how to frame the let-
ter,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;In fact, if I am not
very much mistaken, here is the gentleman him-
self coming up the drive.&#8221;

<p>A man was striding up the path which led to
the door. He was a tall, handsome, swarthy fel-
low, clad in a suit of grey flannel, with a Panama
hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive
hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked.
He swaggered up the path as if the place belonged
to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at
the bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, gentlemen,&#8221; said Holmes, quietly,
&#8220;that we had best take up our position behind the
door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing
with such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs,
inspector. You can leave the talking to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We waited in silence for a minute&#8212;one of those
minutes which one can never forget. Then the
door opened and the man stepped in. In an in-
stant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head and
Martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. It
was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow
was helpless before he knew that he was attacked.
He glared from one to the other of us with a pair
of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this
time. I seem to have knocked up against some-
thing hard. But I came here in answer to a letter
from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don&#8217;t tell me that she is
in this? Don&#8217;t tell me that she helped to set a trap
for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured and
is at death&#8217;s door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang
through the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221; he cried, fiercely. &#8220;It was he
that was hurt, not she. Who would have hurt little
Elsie? I may have threatened her, God forgive me,
but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty
head. Take it back&#8212;you! Say that she is not hurt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was found badly wounded by the side of
her dead husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sank with a deep groan on to the settee and
buried his face in his manacled hands. For five
minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face once
more, and spoke with the cold composure of de-
spair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;If I shot the man he had his shot at me,
and there&#8217;s no murder in that. But if you think I
could have hurt that woman, then you don&#8217;t know
either me or her. I tell you there was never a man
in this world loved a woman more than I loved
her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to
me years ago. Who was this Englishman that he
should come between us? I tell you that I had the
first right to her, and that I was only claiming my
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She broke away from your influence when she
found the man that you are,&#8221; said Holmes, sternly.
&#8220;She fled from America to avoid you, and she mar-
ried an honourable gentleman in England. You
dogged her and followed her and made her life a
misery to her in order to induce her to abandon
the husband whom she loved and respected in or-
der to fly with you, whom she feared and hated.
You have ended by bringing about the death of a
noble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is
</p>
<p>456</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>your record in this business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and
you will answer for it to the law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Elsie dies I care nothing what becomes of
me,&#8221; said the American. He opened one of his
hands and looked at a note crumpled up in his
palm. &#8220;See here, mister,&#8221; he cried, with a gleam
of suspicion in his eyes, &#8220;you&#8217;re not trying to scare
me over this, are you? If the lady is hurt as bad
as you say, who was it that wrote this note?&#8221; He
tossed it forwards on to the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote it to bring you here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wrote it? There was no one on earth out-
side the Joint who knew the secret of the dancing
men. How came you to write it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What one man can invent another can dis-
cover,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;There is a cab coming to
convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But, mean-
while, you have time to make some small repa-
ration for the injury you have wrought. Are you
aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain un-
der grave suspicion of the murder of her husband,
and that it was only my presence here and the
knowledge which I happened to possess which has
saved her from the accusation? The least that you
owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that
she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsi-
ble for his tragic end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask nothing better,&#8221; said the American. &#8220;I
guess the very best case I can make for myself is
the absolute naked truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my duty to warn you that it will be used
against you,&#8221; cried the inspector, with the magnif-
icent fair-play of the British criminal law.
</p>
<p>Slaney shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chance that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;First of all, I want
you gentlemen to understand that I have known
this lady since she was a child. There were seven
of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie&#8217;s father was
the boss of the Joint. He was a clever man, was
old Patrick. It was he who invented that writing,
which would pass as a child&#8217;s scrawl unless you
just happened to have the key to it. Well, Elsie
learned some of our ways; but she couldn&#8217;t stand
the business, and she had a bit of honest money of
her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away
to London. She had been engaged to me, and she
would have married me, I believe, if I had taken
over another profession; but she would have noth-
ing to do with anything on the cross. It was only
after her marriage to this Englishman that I was
able to find out where she was. I wrote to her,
but got no answer. After that I came over, and, as
</p>
<p>letters were no use, I put my messages where she
could read them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have been here a month now. I lived
in that farm, where I had a room down below, and
could get in and out every night, and no one the
wiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew
that she read the messages, for once she wrote an
answer under one of them. Then my temper got
the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She
sent me a letter then, imploring me to go away
and saying that it would break her heart if any
scandal should come upon her husband. She said
that she would come down when her husband was
asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me
through the end window, if I would go away af-
terwards and leave her in peace. She came down
and brought money with her, trying to bribe me
to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm
and tried to pull her through the window. At that
moment in rushed the husband with his revolver
in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor,
and we were face to face. I was heeled also, and
I held up my gun to scare him off and let me get
away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off al-
most at the same instant, and down he dropped.
I made away across the garden, and as I went I
heard the window shut behind me. That&#8217;s God&#8217;s
truth, gentlemen, every word of it, and I heard no
more about it until
