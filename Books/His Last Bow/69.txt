<p>ut why Turkish?&#8221; asked Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, gazing fixedly at my boots. I
was reclining in a cane-backed chair at
the moment, and my protruded feet had
</p>
<p>attracted his ever-active attention.
&#8220;English,&#8221; I answered in some surprise. &#8220;I got
</p>
<p>them at Latimer&#8217;s, in Oxford Street.&#8221;
Holmes smiled with an expression of weary pa-
</p>
<p>tience.
&#8220;The bath!&#8221; he said; &#8220;the bath! Why the relax-
</p>
<p>ing and expensive Turkish rather than the invigo-
rating home-made article?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because for the last few days I have been feel-
ing rheumatic and old. A Turkish bath is what
we call an alterative in medicine&#8212;a fresh starting-
point, a cleanser of the system.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Holmes,&#8221; I added, &#8220;I have no
doubt the connection between my boots and a
Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a
logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you
if you would indicate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The train of reasoning is not very obscure,
Watson,&#8221; said Holmes with a mischievous twinkle.
&#8220;It belongs to the same elementary class of deduc-
tion which I should illustrate if I were to ask you
who shared your cab in your drive this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t admit that a fresh illustration is an ex-
planation,&#8221; said I with some asperity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Watson! A very dignified and logical
remonstrance. Let me see, what were the points?
Take the last one first&#8212;the cab. You observe that
you have some splashes on the left sleeve and
shoulder of your coat. Had you sat in the cen-
tre of a hansom you would probably have had no
splashes, and if you had they would certainly have
been symmetrical. Therefore it is clear that you sat
at the side. Therefore it is equally clear that you
had a companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very evident.&#8221;
&#8220;Absurdly commonplace, is it not?&#8221;
&#8220;But the boots and the bath?&#8221;
&#8220;Equally childish. You are in the habit of doing
</p>
<p>up your boots in a certain way. I see them on this
occasion fastened with an elaborate double bow,
which is not your usual method of tying them. You
have, therefore, had them off. Who has tied them?
A bootmaker&#8212;or the boy at the bath. It is unlikely
that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly
new. Well, what remains? The bath. Absurd, is it
not? But, for all that, the Turkish bath has served
a purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that you have had it because you need
a change. Let me suggest that you take one. How
would Lausanne do, my dear Watson&#8212;first-class
tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid! But why?&#8221;
Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took
</p>
<p>his notebook from his pocket.
&#8220;One of the most dangerous classes in the
</p>
<p>world,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the drifting and friendless
woman. She is the most harmless and often the
most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable in-
citer of crime in others. She is helpless. She is mi-
gratory. She has sufficient means to take her from
country to country and from hotel to hotel. She
is lost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure pen-
sions and boardinghouses. She is a stray chicken
in a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she
is hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has
come to the Lady Frances Carfax.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was relieved at this sudden descent from the
general to the particular. Holmes consulted his
notes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Frances,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;is the sole sur-
vivor of the direct family of the late Earl of Rufton.
The estates went, as you may remember, in the
male line. She was left with limited means, but
with some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery
of silver and curiously cut diamonds to which she
was fondly attached&#8212;too attached, for she refused
to leave them with her banker and always car-
ried them about with her. A rather pathetic fig-
ure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in
fresh middle age, and yet, by a strange change, the
last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a
goodly fleet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened to her, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances?
</p>
<p>Is she alive or dead? There is our problem. She
is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it
has been her invariable custom to write every sec-
ond week to Miss Dobney, her old governess, who
has long retired and lives in Camberwell. It is this
Miss Dobney who has consulted me. Nearly five
weeks have passed without a word. The last letter
was from the Hotel National at Lausanne. Lady
Frances seems to have left there and given no ad-
dress. The family are anxious, and as they are ex-
ceedingly wealthy no sum will be spared if we can
clear the matter up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Miss Dobney the only source of informa-
tion? Surely she had other correspondents?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one correspondent who is a sure
draw, Watson. That is the bank. Single ladies must
live, and their passbooks are compressed diaries.
</p>
<p>817</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax
</p>
<p>She banks at Silvester&#8217;s. I have glanced over her
account. The last check but one paid her bill at
Lausanne, but it was a large one and probably left
her with cash in hand. Only one check has been
drawn since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom, and where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to
show where the check was drawn. It was cashed at
the Credit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than three
weeks ago. The sum was fifty pounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is Miss Marie Devine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That also I have been able to discover. Miss
Marie Devine was the maid of Lady Frances Car-
fax. Why she should have paid her this check we
have not yet determined. I have no doubt, how-
ever, that your researches will soon clear the mat-
ter up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My researches!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hence the health-giving expedition to Lau-
sanne. You know that I cannot possibly leave Lon-
don while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of
his life. Besides, on general principles it is best that
I should not leave the country. Scotland Yard feels
lonely without me, and it causes an unhealthy ex-
citement among the criminal classes. Go, then, my
dear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever
be valued at so extravagant a rate as two pence a
word, it waits your disposal night and day at the
end of the Continental wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two days later found me at the Hotel National
at Lausanne, where I received every courtesy at
the hands of M. Moser, the well-known manager.
Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there
for several weeks. She had been much liked by all
who met her. Her age was not more than forty.
She was still handsome and bore every sign of
having in her youth been a very lovely woman.
M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery,
but it had been remarked by the servants that the
heavy trunk in the lady&#8217;s bedroom was always
scrupulously locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was
as popular as her mistress. She was actually en-
gaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and
there was no difficulty in getting her address. It
was 11 Rue de Trajan, Montpellier. All this I jotted
down and felt that Holmes himself could not have
been more adroit in collecting his facts.
</p>
<p>Only one corner still remained in the shadow.
No light which I possessed could clear up the
cause for the lady&#8217;s sudden departure. She was
very happy at Lausanne. There was every reason
to believe that she intended to remain for the sea-
son in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake.
</p>
<p>And yet she had left at a single day&#8217;s notice, which
involved her in the useless payment of a week&#8217;s
rent. Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had
any suggestion to offer. He connected the sud-
den departure with the visit to the hotel a day
or two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. &#8220;Un
sauvage&#8212;un ve&#180;ritable sauvage!&#8221; cried Jules Vibart.
The man had rooms somewhere in the town. He
had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the
promenade by the lake. Then he had called. She
had refused to see him. He was English, but of his
name there was no record. Madame had left the
place immediately afterwards. Jules Vibart, and,
what was of more importance, Jules Vibart&#8217;s sweet-
heart, thought that this call and the departure were
cause and effect. Only one thing Jules would not
discuss. That was the reason why Marie had left
her mistress. Of that he could or would say noth-
ing. If I wished to know, I must go to Montpellier
and ask her.
</p>
<p>So ended the first chapter of my inquiry. The
second was devoted to the place which Lady
Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lau-
sanne. Concerning this there had been some se-
crecy, which confirmed the idea that she had gone
with the intention of throwing someone off her
track. Otherwise why should not her luggage have
been openly labelled for Baden? Both she and it
reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous route.
This much I gathered from the manager of Cook&#8217;s
local office. So to Baden I went, after dispatching
to Holmes an account of all my proceedings and
receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous
commendation.
</p>
<p>At Baden the track was not difficult to follow.
Lady Frances had stayed at the Englischer Hof for
a fortnight. While there she had made the acquain-
tance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a mission-
ary from South America. Like most lonely ladies,
Lady Frances found her comfort and occupation
in religion. Dr. Shlessinger&#8217;s remarkable personal-
ity, his whole hearted devotion, and the fact that
he was recovering from a disease contracted in the
exercise of his apostolic duties affected her deeply.
She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of
the convalescent saint. He spent his day, as the
manager described it to me, upon a lounge-chair
on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon either
side of him. He was preparing a map of the Holy
Land, with special reference to the kingdom of the
Midianites, upon which he was writing a mono-
graph. Finally, having improved much in health,
he and his wife had returned to London, and Lady
Frances had started thither in their company. This
was just three weeks before, and the manager had
</p>
<p>818</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>heard nothing since. As to the maid, Marie, she
had gone off some days beforehand in floods of
tears, after informing the other maids that she was
leaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger had paid
the bill of the whole party before his departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said the landlord in conclusion,
&#8220;you are not the only friend of Lady Frances Car-
fax who is inquiring after her just now. Only a
week or so ago we had a man here upon the same
errand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he give a name?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None; but he was an Englishman, though of
an unusual type.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A savage?&#8221; said I, linking my facts after the
fashion of my illustrious friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a
bulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if
he would be more at home in a farmers&#8217; inn than
in a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should
think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Already the mystery began to define itself, as
figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog. Here
was this good and pious lady pursued from place
to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure. She
feared him, or she would not have fled from Lau-
sanne. He had still followed. Sooner or later he
would overtake her. Had he already overtaken
her? Was that the secret of her continued silence?
Could the good people who were her companions
not screen her from his violence or his blackmail?
What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay be-
hind this long pursuit? There was the problem
which I had to solve.
</p>
<p>To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and
surely I had got down to the roots of the matter.
In reply I had a telegram asking for a description
of Dr. Shlessinger&#8217;s left ear. Holmes&#8217;s ideas of hu-
mour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I
took no notice of his ill-timed jest&#8212;indeed, I had
already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the
maid, Marie, before his message came.
</p>
<p>I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and
in learning all that she could tell me. She was a
devoted creature, who had only left her mistress
because she was sure that she was in good hands,
and because her own approaching marriage made
a separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress
had, as she confessed with distress, shown some ir-
ritability of temper towards her during their stay in
Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she
had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made
the parting easier than it would otherwise have
been. Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as
</p>
<p>a wedding-present. Like me, Marie viewed with
deep distrust the stranger who had driven her mis-
tress from Lausanne. With her own eyes she had
seen him seize the lady&#8217;s wrist with great violence
on the public promenade by the lake. He was a
fierce and terrible man. She believed that it was
out of dread of him that Lady Frances had ac-
cepted the escort of the Shlessingers to London.
She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many
little signs had convinced the maid that her mis-
tress lived in a state of continual nervous appre-
hension. So far she had got in her narrative, when
suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face
was convulsed with surprise and fear. &#8220;See!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;The miscreant follows still! There is the
very man of whom I speak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Through the open sitting-room window I saw
a huge, swarthy man with a bristling black beard
walking slowly down the centre of the street and
staring eagerly at he numbers of the houses. It was
clear that, like myself, he was on the track of the
maid. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I
rushed out and accosted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an Englishman,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;What if I am?&#8221; he asked with a most villain-
</p>
<p>ous scowl.
&#8220;May I ask what your name is?&#8221;
&#8220;No, you may not,&#8221; said he with decision.
The situation was awkward, but the most direct
</p>
<p>way is often the best.
&#8220;Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?&#8221; I asked.
He stared at me with amazement.
&#8220;What have you done with her? Why have you
</p>
<p>pursued her? I insist upon an answer!&#8221; said I.
The fellow gave a below of anger and sprang
</p>
<p>upon me like a tiger. I have held my own in many
a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the
fury of a fiend. His hand was on my throat and
my senses were nearly gone before an unshaven
French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted out from
a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and
struck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm,
which made him leave go his hold. He stood for an
instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether
he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl
of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from
which I had just come. I turned to thank my pre-
server, who stood beside me in the roadway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a very pretty hash
you have made of it! I rather think you had better
come back with me to London by the night ex-
press.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his
usual garb and style, was seated in my private
</p>
<p>819</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax
</p>
<p>room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden
and opportune appearance was simplicity itself,
for, finding that he could get away from London,
he determined to head me off at the next obvious
point of my travels. In the disguise of a work-
ingman he had sat in the cabaret waiting for my
appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a singularly consistent investigation you
have made, my dear Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I cannot at
the moment recall any possible blunder which you
have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding
has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to
discover nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would have done no better,&#8221; I an-
swered bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;perhaps&#8217; about it. I have done
better. Here is the Hon. Philip Green, who is a
fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may
find him the starting-point for a more successful
investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A card had come up on a salver, and it was
followed by the same bearded ruffian who had at-
tacked me in the street. He started when he saw
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I had
your note and I have come. But what has this man
to do with the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Wat-
son, who is helping us in this affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand,
with a few words of apology.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I didn&#8217;t harm you. When you accused
me of hurting her I lost my grip of myself. In-
deed, I&#8217;m not responsible in these days. My nerves
are like live wires. But this situation is beyond
me. What I want to know, in the first place, Mr.
Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of
my existence at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady
Frances&#8217;s governess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I re-
member her well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she remembers you. It was in the days
before&#8212;before you found it better to go to South
Africa.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need
hide nothing from you. I swear to you, Mr.
Holmes, that there never was in this world a man
who loved a woman with a more wholehearted
love than I had for Frances. I was a wild young-
ster, I know&#8212;not worse than others of my class.
But her mind was pure as snow. She could not
</p>
<p>bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came
to hear of things that I had done, she would have
no more to say to me. And yet she loved me&#8212;that
is the wonder of it!&#8212;loved me well enough to re-
main single all her sainted days just for my sake
alone. When the years had passed and I had made
my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could
seek her out and soften her. I had heard that she
was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and
tried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her
will was strong, and when next I called she had
left the town. I traced her to Baden, and then after
a time heard that her maid was here. I&#8217;m a rough
fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Wat-
son spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for
a moment. But for God&#8217;s sake tell me what has
become of the Lady Frances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is for us to find out,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes with peculiar gravity. &#8220;What is your Lon-
don address, Mr. Green?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Langham Hotel will find me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I recommend that you return there
and be on hand in case I should want you? I have
no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may
rest assured that all that can be done will be done
for the safety of Lady Frances. I can say no more
for the instant. I will leave you this card so that
you may be able to keep in touch with us. Now,
Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to
Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts for
two hungry travellers at 7.30 to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A telegram was awaiting us when we reached
our Baker Street rooms, which Holmes read with
an exclamation of interest and threw across to me.
&#8220;Jagged or torn,&#8221; was the message, and the place
of origin, Baden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is everything,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;You
may remember my seemingly irrelevant question
as to this clerical gentleman&#8217;s left ear. You did not
answer it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had left Baden and could not inquire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to
the manager of the Englischer Hof, whose answer
lies here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it show?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing
with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man.
The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South
America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the
most unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever
evolved&#8212;and for a young country it has turned
</p>
<p>820</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>out some very finished types. His particular spe-
cialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by play-
ing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called
wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy
helpmate. The nature of his tactics suggested his
identity to me, and this physical peculiarity&#8212;he
was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in
&#8217;89&#8212;confirmed my suspicion. This poor lady is in
the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick
at nothing, Watson. That she is already dead is
a very likely supposition. If not, she is undoubt-
edly in some sort of confinement and unable to
write to Miss Dobney or her other friends. It is
always possible that she never reached London, or
that she has passed through it, but the former is
improbable, as, with their system of registration,
it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the
Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely,
as these rouges could not hope to find any other
place where it would be as easy to keep a person
under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is
in London, but as we have at present no possible
means of telling where, we can only take the ob-
vious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls
in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down
and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland
Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But neither the official police nor Holmes&#8217;s
own small but very efficient organization sufficed
to clear away the mystery. Amid the crowded
millions of London the three persons we sought
were as completely obliterated as if they had never
lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed.
Clues were followed, and led to nothing. Ev-
ery criminal resort which Shlessinger might fre-
quent was drawn in vain. His old associates were
watched, but they kept clear of him. And then
suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there
came a flash of light. A silver-and-brilliant pen-
dant of old Spanish design had been pawned at
Bovington&#8217;s, in Westminster Road. The pawner
was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appear-
ance. His name and address were demonstrably
false. The ear had escaped notice, but the descrip-
tion was surely that of Shlessinger.
</p>
<p>Three times had our bearded friend from the
Langham called for news&#8212;the third time within
an hour of this fresh development. His clothes
were getting looser on his great body. He seemed
to be wilting away in his anxiety. &#8220;If you will only
give me something to do!&#8221; was his constant wail.
At last Holmes could oblige him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should
get him now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But does this mean that any harm has befallen
the Lady Frances?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head very gravely.
&#8220;Supposing that they have held her prisoner up
</p>
<p>to now, it is clear that they cannot let her loose
without their own destruction. We must prepare
for the worst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221;
&#8220;These people do not know you by sight?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;It is possible that he will go to some other
</p>
<p>pawnbroker in the future. in that case, we must
begin again. On the other hand, he has had a fair
price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of
ready-money he will probably come back to Bov-
ington&#8217;s. I will give you a note to them, and they
will let you wait in the shop. If the fellow comes
you will follow him home. But no indiscretion,
and, above all, no violence. I put you on your hon-
our that you will take no step without my knowl-
edge and consent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was,
I may mention, the son of the famous admiral of
that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet
in the Crimean War) brought us no news. On the
evening of the third he rushed into our sitting-
room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his
powerful frame quivering with excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have him! We have him!&#8221; he cried.
He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes
</p>
<p>soothed him with a few words and thrust him into
an armchair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now, give us the order of events,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She came only an hour ago. It was the wife,
this time, but the pendant she brought was the fel-
low of the other. She is a tall, pale woman, with
ferret eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the lady,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;She left the office and I followed her. She
</p>
<p>walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept be-
hind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr.
Holmes, it was an undertaker&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My companion started. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked in
that vibrant voice which told of the fiery soul be-
hind the cold gray face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was talking to the woman behind the
counter. I entered as well. &#8216;It is late,&#8217; I heard her
say, or words to that effect. The woman was ex-
cusing herself. &#8216;It should be there before now,&#8217; she
answered. &#8216;It took longer, being out of the ordi-
nary.&#8217; They both stopped and looked at me, so I
asked some questions and then left the shop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>821</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did excellently well. What happened
next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman came out, but I had hid myself
in a doorway. Her suspicions had been aroused, I
think, for she looked round her. Then she called a
cab and got in. I was lucky enough to get another
and so to follow her. She got down at last at No.
36, Poultney Square, Brixton. I drove past, left my
cab at the corner of the square, and watched the
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see anyone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The windows were all in darkness save one on
the lower floor. The blind was down, and I could
not see in. I was standing there, wondering what
I should do next, when a covered van drove up
with two men in it. They descended, took some-
thing out of the van, and carried it up the steps to
the hall door. Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For an instant I was on the point of rushing in.
The door had been opened to admit the men and
their burden. It was the woman who had opened
it. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me,
and I think that she recognized me. I saw her start,
and she hastily closed the door. I remembered my
promise to you, and here I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done excellent work,&#8221; said Holmes,
scribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper.
&#8220;We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and
you can serve the cause best by taking this note
down to the authorities and getting one. There
may be some difficulty, but I should think that the
sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade
will see to all details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they may murder her in the meanwhile.
What could the coffin mean, and for whom could
it be but for her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green.
Not a moment will be lost. Leave it in our hands.
Now Watson,&#8221; he added as our client hurried
away, &#8220;he will set the regular forces on the move.
We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take
our own line of action. The situation strikes me as
so desperate that the most extreme measures are
justified. Not a moment is to be lost in getting to
Poultney Square.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us try to reconstruct the situation,&#8221; said
he as we drove swiftly past the Houses of Parlia-
ment and over Westminster Bridge. &#8220;These villains
have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after
first alienating her from her faithful maid. If she
has written any letters they have been intercepted.
Through some confederate they have engaged a
</p>
<p>furnished house. Once inside it, they have made
her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of
the valuable jewellery which has been their object
from the first. Already they have begun to sell part
of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they
have no reason to think that anyone is interested
in the lady&#8217;s fate. When she is released she will, of
course, denounce them. Therefore, she must not
be released. But they cannot keep her under lock
and key forever. So murder is their only solution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems very clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we will take another line of reasoning.
When you follow two separate chains of thought,
Watson, you will find some point of intersection
which should approximate to the truth. We will
start now, not from the lady but from the cof-
fin and argue backward. That incident proves,
I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead.
It points also to an orthodox burial with proper
accompaniment of medical certificate and official
sanction. Had the lady been obviously murdered,
they would have buried her in a hole in the back
garden. But here all is open and regular. What
does this mean? Surely that they have done her to
death in some way which has deceived the doctor
and simulated a natural end&#8212;poisoning, perhaps.
And yet how strange that they should ever let a
doctor approach her unless he were a confederate,
which is hardly a credible proposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could they have forged a medical certificate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I
hardly see them doing that. Pull up, cabby! This is
evidently the undertaker&#8217;s, for we have just passed
the pawnbroker&#8217;s. Would go in, Watson? Your ap-
pearance inspires confidence. Ask what hour the
Poultney Square funeral takes place to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman in the shop answered me without
hesitation that it was to be at eight o&#8217;clock in the
morning. &#8220;You see, Watson, no mystery; every-
thing above-board! In some way the legal forms
have undoubtedly been complied with, and they
think that they have little to fear. Well, there&#8217;s
nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are
you armed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My stick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we shall be strong enough. &#8216;Thrice
is he armed who hath his quarrel just.&#8217; We sim-
ply can&#8217;t afford to wait for the police or to keep
within the four corners of the law. You can drive
off, cabby. Now, Watson, we&#8217;ll just take our luck
together, as we have occasionally in the past.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had rung loudly at the door of a great
dark house in the centre of Poultney Square. It
</p>
<p>822</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall
woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221; she asked sharply,
peering at us through the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no such person here,&#8221; she answered,
and tried to close the door, but Holmes had
jammed it with his foot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want to see the man who lives here,
whatever he may call himself,&#8221; said Holmes firmly.
</p>
<p>She hesitated. Then she threw open the door.
&#8220;Well, come in!&#8221; said she. &#8220;My husband is not
afraid to face any man in the world.&#8221; She closed
the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-
room on the right side of the hall, turning up the
gas as she left us. &#8220;Mr. Peters will be with you in
an instant,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Her words were literally true, for we had
hardly time to look around the dusty and moth-
eaten apartment in which we found ourselves be-
fore the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-
headed man stepped lightly into the room. He
had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and
a general air of superficial benevolence which was
marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is surely some mistake here, gentle-
men,&#8221; he said in an unctuous, make-everything-
easy voice. &#8220;I fancy that you have been misdi-
rected. Possibly if you tried farther down the
street&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do; we have no time to waste,&#8221; said
my companion firmly. &#8220;You are Henry Peters, of
Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of Baden
and South America. I am as sure of that as that
my own name is Sherlock Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared
hard at his formidable pursuer. &#8220;I guess your
name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he
coolly. &#8220;When a man&#8217;s conscience is easy you can&#8217;t
rattle him. What is your business in my house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know what you have done with the
Lady Frances Carfax, whom you brought away
with you from Baden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad if you could tell me where
that lady may be,&#8221; Peters answered coolly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
bill against her for a nearly a hundred pounds, and
nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery
pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. She
attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden&#8212;it
is a fact that I was using another name at the
time&#8212;and she stuck on to us until we came to
</p>
<p>London. I paid her bill and her ticket. Once in
London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left
these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find
her, Mr. Holmes, and I&#8217;m your debtor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In mean to find her,&#8220; said Sherlock Holmes.
&#8221;I&#8217;m going through this house till I do find her.&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your warrant?&#8221;
Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This will have to serve till a better one comes.&#8221;
&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re a common burglar.&#8221;
&#8220;So you might describe me,&#8221; said Holmes
</p>
<p>cheerfully. &#8220;My companion is also a dangerous
ruffian. And together we are going through your
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our opponent opened the door.
&#8220;Fetch a policeman, Annie!&#8221; said he. There was
</p>
<p>a whisk of feminine skirts down the passage, and
the hall door was opened and shut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our time is limited, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;If
you try to stop us, Peters, you will most certainly
get hurt. Where is that coffin which was brought
into your house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with the coffin? It is in use.
There is a body in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see the body.&#8221;
&#8220;Never with my consent.&#8221;
&#8220;Then without it.&#8221; With a quick movement
</p>
<p>Holmes pushed the fellow to one side and passed
into the hall. A door half opened stood immedi-
ately before us. We entered. It was the dining-
room. On the table, under a half-lit chandelier, the
coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and
raised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of the
coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from the
lights above beat down upon an aged and with-
ered face. By no possible process of cruelty, star-
vation, or disease could this wornout wreck be the
still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes&#8217;s face showed
his amazement, and also his relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It&#8217;s someone
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve blundered badly for once, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; said Peters, who had followed
us into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the dead woman?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, if you really must know, she is an old
</p>
<p>nurse of my wife&#8217;s, Rose Spender by name, whom
we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary.
We brought her round here, called in Dr. Hor-
som, of 13 Firbank Villas&#8212;mind you take the ad-
dress, Mr. Holmes&#8212;and had her carefully tended,
as Christian folk should. On the third day she
died&#8212;certificate says senile decay&#8212;but that&#8217;s only
</p>
<p>823</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax
</p>
<p>the doctor&#8217;s opinion, and of course you know bet-
ter. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by
Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who
will bury her at eight o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning.
Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You&#8217;ve
made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up
to it. I&#8217;d give something for a photograph of your
gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid
expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only
found a poor old woman of ninety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s expression was as impassive as ever
under the jeers of his antagonist, but his clenched
hands betrayed his acute annoyance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going through your house,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Are you, though!&#8221; cried Peters as a woman&#8217;s
</p>
<p>voice and heavy steps sounded in the passage.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see about that. This way, officers, if
you please. These men have forced their way into
my house, and I cannot get rid of them. Help me
to put them out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sergeant and a constable stood in the door-
way. Holmes drew his card from his case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my name and address. This is my
friend, Dr. Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, sir, we know you very well,&#8221; said
the sergeant, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t stay here without a
warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. I quite understand that.&#8221;
&#8220;Arrest him!&#8221; cried Peters.
&#8220;We know where to lay our hands on this gen-
</p>
<p>tleman if he is wanted,&#8221; said the sergeant majesti-
cally, &#8220;but you&#8217;ll have to go, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.&#8221;
A minute later we were in the street once more.
</p>
<p>Holmes was as cool as ever, but I was hot with
anger and humiliation. The sergeant had followed
us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that&#8217;s the law.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do other-
</p>
<p>wise.&#8221;
&#8220;I expect there was good reason for your pres-
</p>
<p>ence there. If there is anything I can do&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she
</p>
<p>is in that house. I expect a warrant presently.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll keep my eye on the parties, Mr.
</p>
<p>Holmes. If anything comes along, I will surely let
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was only ni
