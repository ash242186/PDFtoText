</p>
<p>An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes</p>

</div></div>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>t was nine o&#8217;clock at night upon the sec-
ond of August&#8212;the most terrible August
in the history of the world. One might
have thought already that God&#8217;s curse
</p>
<p>hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there
was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague ex-
pectancy in the sultry and stagnant air. The sun
had long set, but one blood-red gash like an open
wound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars
were shining brightly, and below, the lights of the
shipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous
Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the gar-
den walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house
behind them, and they looked down upon the
broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great
chalk cliff in which Von Bork, like some wander-
ing eagle, had perched himself four years before.
They stood with their heads close together, talk-
ing in low, confidential tones. From below the two
glowing ends of their cigars might have been the
smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking
down in the darkness.
</p>
<p>A remarkable man this Von Bork&#8212;a man who
could hardly be matched among all the devoted
agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had
first recommended him for the English mission,
the most important mission of all, but since he
had taken it over those talents had become more
and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the
world who were really in touch with the truth.
One of these was his present companion, Baron
Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation,
whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was block-
ing the country lane as it waited to waft its owner
back to London.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I can judge the trend of events, you
will probably be back in Berlin within the week,&#8221;
the secretary was saying. &#8220;When you get there, my
dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the
welcome you will receive. I happen to know what
is thought in the highest quarters of your work in
this country.&#8221; He was a huge man, the secretary,
deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion
of speech which had been his main asset in his po-
litical career.
</p>
<p>Von Bork laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not very hard to deceive,&#8221; he re-
marked. &#8220;A more docile, simple folk could not
be imagined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said the other
thoughtfully. &#8220;They have strange limits and one
must learn to observe them. It is that surface
simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the
</p>
<p>stranger. One&#8217;s first impression is that they are en-
tirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon some-
thing very hard, and you know that you have
reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the
fact. They have, for example, their insular conven-
tions which simply must be observed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning &#8216;good form&#8217; and that sort of thing?&#8221;
Von Bork sighed as one who had suffered much.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning British prejudice in all its queer man-
ifestations. As an example I may quote one of my
own worst blunders&#8212;I can afford to talk of my
blunders, for you know my work well enough to
be aware of my successes. It was on my first ar-
rival. I was invited to a week-end gathering at the
country house of a cabinet minister. The conversa-
tion was amazingly indiscreet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been there,&#8221; said he
dryly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a resume of
the information to Berlin. Unfortunately our good
chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these mat-
ters, and he transmitted a remark which showed
that he was aware of what had been said. This, of
course, took the trail straight up to me. You&#8217;ve no
idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing
soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can
assure you. I was two years living it down. Now
you, with this sporting pose of yours&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t call it a pose. A pose is an ar-
tificial thing. This is quite natural. I am a born
sportsman. I enjoy it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that makes it the more effective. You
yacht against them, you hunt with them, you play
polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-
hand takes the prize at Olympia. I have even heard
that you go the length of boxing with the young
officers. What is the result? Nobody takes you
seriously. You are a &#8216;good old sport,&#8217; &#8216;quite a de-
cent fellow for a German,&#8217; a hard-drinking, night-
club, knock-about-town, devil-may-care young fel-
low. And all the time this quiet country house of
yours is the centre of half the mischief in England,
and the sporting squire the most astute secret-
service man in Europe. Genius, my dear Von
Bork&#8212;genius!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You flatter me, Baron. But certainly I may
claim my four years in this country have not been
unproductive. I&#8217;ve never shown you my little
store. Would you mind stepping in for a mo-
ment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door of the study opened straight on to the
terrace. Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the
way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He
</p>
<p>843</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>His Last Bow
</p>
<p>then closed the door behind the bulky form which
followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy cur-
tain over the latticed window. Only when all these
precautions had been taken and tested did he turn
his sunburned aquiline face to his guest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of my papers have gone,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;When my wife and the household left yester-
day for Flushing they took the less important with
them. I must, of course, claim the protection of the
embassy for the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name has already been filed as one of the
personal suite. There will be no difficulties for you
or your baggage. Of course, it is just possible that
we may not have to go. England may leave France
to her fate. We are sure that there is no binding
treaty between them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Belgium?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, and Belgium, too.&#8221;
Von Bork shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that
</p>
<p>could be. There is a definite treaty there. She could
never recover from such a humiliation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She would at least have peace for the mo-
ment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But her honor?&#8221;
&#8220;Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age.
</p>
<p>Honour is a mediaeval conception. Besides Eng-
land is not ready. It is an inconceivable thing, but
even our special war tax of fifty million, which one
would think made our purpose as clear as if we
had advertised it on the front page of the Times,
has not roused these people from their slumbers.
Here and there one hears a question. It is my
business to find an answer. Here and there also
there is an irritation. It is my business to soothe
it. But I can assure you that so far as the essen-
tials go&#8212;the storage of munitions, the preparation
for submarine attack, the arrangements for making
high explosives&#8212;nothing is prepared. How, then,
can England come in, especially when we have
stirred her up such a devil&#8217;s brew of Irish civil war,
window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to
keep her thoughts at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She must think of her future.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, that is another matter. I fancy that in the
</p>
<p>future we have our own very definite plans about
England, and that your information will be very
vital to us. It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John
Bull. If he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready.
If it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. I
should think they would be wiser to fight with al-
lies than without them, but that is their own affair.
This week is their week of destiny. But you were
speaking of your papers.&#8221; He sat in the armchair
</p>
<p>with the light shining upon his broad bald head,
while he puffed sedately at his cigar.
</p>
<p>The large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a
curtain hung in the future corner. When this was
drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Von
Bork detached a small key from his watch chain,
and after some considerable manipulation of the
lock he swung open the heavy door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said he, standing clear, with a wave of
his hand.
</p>
<p>The light shone vividly into the opened safe,
and the secretary of the embassy gazed with an
absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-
holes with which it was furnished. Each pigeon-
hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced
along them read a long series of such titles as
&#8220;Fords,&#8221; &#8220;Harbour-defences,&#8221; &#8220;Aeroplanes,&#8221; &#8220;Ire-
land,&#8221; &#8220;Egypt,&#8221; &#8220;Portsmouth forts,&#8221; &#8220;The Chan-
nel,&#8221; &#8220;Rosythe,&#8221; and a score of others. Each com-
partment was bristling with papers and plans.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colossal!&#8221; said the secretary. Putting down
his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And all in four years, Baron. Not such a bad
show for the hard-drinking, hard-riding country
squire. But the gem of my collection is coming and
there is the setting all ready for it.&#8221; He pointed to
a space over which &#8220;Naval Signals&#8221; was printed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have a good dossier there already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty
in some way got the alarm and every code has
been changed. It was a blow, Baron&#8212;the worst
setback in my whole campaign. But thanks to my
check-book and the good Altamont all will be well
to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Baron looked at his watch and gave a gut-
tural exclamation of disappointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I really can wait no longer. You can
imagine that things are moving at present in Carl-
ton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts.
I had hoped to be able to bring news of your great
coup. Did Altamont name no hour?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork pushed over a telegram.
</p>
<p>Will come without fail to-night and
bring new sparking plugs.
</p>
<p>&#8212; &#8212;Altamont.
</p>
<p>844</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Sparking plugs, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep
a full garage. In our code everything likely to come
up is named after some spare part. If he talks of a
radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser,
and so on. Sparking plugs are naval signals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From Portsmouth at midday,&#8221; said the secre-
tary, examining the superscription. &#8220;By the way,
what do you give him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred pounds for this particular job.
Of course he has a salary as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The greedy rouge. They are useful, these
traitors, but I grudge them their blood money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonder-
ful worker. If I pay him well, at least he deliv-
ers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he
is not a traitor. I assure you that our most pan-
Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in his feelings
towards England as compared with a real bitter
Irish-American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, an Irish-American?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you heard him talk you would not doubt it.
Sometimes I assure you I can hardly understand
him. He seems to have declared war on the King&#8217;s
English as well as on the English king. Must you
really go? He may be here any moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m sorry, but I have already overstayed
my time. We shall expect you early to-morrow,
and when you get that signal book through the
little door on the Duke of York&#8217;s steps you can
put a triumphant finis to your record in England.
What! Tokay!&#8221; He indicated a heavily sealed dust-
covered bottle which stood with two high glasses
upon a salver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I offer you a glass before your journey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he
took a fancy to my Tokay. He is a touchy fellow
and needs humouring in small things. I have to
study him, I assure you.&#8221; They had strolled out on
to the terrace again, and along it to the further end
where at a touch from the Baron&#8217;s chauffeur the
great car shivered and chuckled. &#8220;Those are the
lights of Harwich, I suppose,&#8221; said the secretary,
pulling on his dust coat. &#8220;How still and peaceful
it all seems. There may be other lights within the
week, and the English coast a less tranquil place!
The heavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if
all that the good Zeppelin promises us comes true.
By the way, who is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only one window showed a light behind them;
in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, seated at
</p>
<p>a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a
country cap. She was bending over her knitting
and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black
cat upon a stool beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Martha, the only servant I have left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The secretary chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She might almost personify Britannia,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;with her complete self-absorption and general
air of comfortable somnolence. Well, au revoir, Von
Bork!&#8221; With a final wave of his hand he sprang
into the car, and a moment later the two golden
cones from the headlights shot through the dark-
ness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the
luxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of
the impending European tragedy that he hardly
observed that as his car swung round the village
street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in
the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Von Bork walked slowly back to the study
when the last gleams of the motor lamps had
faded into the distance. As he passed he observed
that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and
retired. It was a new experience to him, the silence
and darkness of his widespread house, for his fam-
ily and household had been a large one. It was a
relief to him, however, to think that they were all
in safety and that, but for that one old woman who
had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place
to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to
do inside his study and he set himself to do it until
his keen, handsome face was flushed with the heat
of the burning papers. A leather valise stood be-
side his table, and into this he began to pack very
neatly and systematically the precious contents of
his safe. He had hardly got started with the work,
however, when his quick ears caught the sounds of
a distant car. Instantly he gave an exclamation of
satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe,
locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He
was just in time to see the lights of a small car
come to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang
out of it and advanced swiftly towards him, while
the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man with a
gray moustache, settled down like one who resigns
himself to a long vigil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Von Bork eagerly, running for-
ward to meet his visitor.
</p>
<p>For answer the man waved a small brown-
paper parcel triumphantly above his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can give me the glad hand to-night, mis-
ter,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m bringing home the bacon at
last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The signals?&#8221;
</p>
<p>845</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>His Last Bow
</p>
<p>&#8220;Same as I said in my cable. Every last one
of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi&#8212;a copy,
mind you, not the original. That was too dan-
gerous. But it&#8217;s the real goods, and you can lay
to that.&#8221; He slapped the German upon the shoul-
der with a rough familiarity from which the other
winced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m all alone in the house.
I was only waiting for this. Of course a copy is
better than the original. If an original were miss-
ing they would change the whole thing. You think
it&#8217;s all safe about the copy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Irish-American had entered the study and
stretched his long limbs from the armchair. He
was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut fea-
tures and a small goatee beard which gave him
a general resemblance to the caricatures of Uncle
Sam. A half-smoked, sodden cigar hung from the
corner of his mouth, and as he sat down he struck
a match and relit it. &#8220;Making ready for a move?&#8221;
he remarked as he looked round him. &#8220;Say, mis-
ter,&#8221; he added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from
which the curtain was now removed, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
tell me you keep your papers in that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
&#8220;Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that!
</p>
<p>And they reckon you to be some spy. Why, a Yan-
kee crook would be into that with a can-opener. If
I&#8217;d known that any letter of mine was goin&#8217; to lie
loose in a thing like that I&#8217;d have been a mug to
write to you at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,&#8221;
Von Bork answered. &#8220;You won&#8217;t cut that metal
with any tool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the lock?&#8221;
&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a double combination lock. You know
</p>
<p>what that is?&#8221;
&#8220;Search me,&#8221; said the American.
&#8220;Well, you need a word as well as a set of
</p>
<p>figures before you can get the lock to work.&#8221; He
rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the
keyhole. &#8220;This outer one is for the letters, the inner
one for the figures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;
&#8220;So it&#8217;s not quite as simple as you thought. It
</p>
<p>was four years ago that I had it made, and what
do you think I chose for the word and figures?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beyond me.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914
</p>
<p>for the figures, and here we are.&#8221;
The American&#8217;s face showed his surprise and
</p>
<p>admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but that was smart! You had it down to a
fine thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a few of us even then could have guessed
the date. Here it is, and I&#8217;m shutting down to-
morrow morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;ll have to fix me up also. I&#8217;m
not staying is this gol-darned country all on my
lonesome. In a week or less, from what I see, John
Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. I&#8217;d
rather watch him from over the water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re an American citizen?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, so was Jack James an American citizen,
</p>
<p>but he&#8217;s doing time in Portland all the same. It cuts
no ice with a British copper to tell him you&#8217;re an
American citizen. &#8216;It&#8217;s British law and order over
here,&#8217; says he. By the way, mister, talking of Jack
James, it seems to me you don&#8217;t do much to cover
your men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Von Bork asked sharply.
&#8220;Well, you are their employer, ain&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s up
</p>
<p>to you to see that they don&#8217;t fall down. But they
do fall down, and when did you ever pick them
up? There&#8217;s James&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was James&#8217;s own fault. You know that your-
self. He was too self-willed for the job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;James was a bonehead&#8212;I give you that. Then
there was Hollis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man was mad.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough to make a man bug-house when he
has to play a part from morning to night with a
hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to
him. But now there is Steiner&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork started violently, and his ruddy face
turned a shade paler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Steiner?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve got him, that&#8217;s all. They raided
</p>
<p>his store last night, and he and his papers are all in
Portsmouth jail. You&#8217;ll go off and he, poor devil,
will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets
off with his life. That&#8217;s why I want to get over the
water as soon as you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but
it was easy to see that the news had shaken him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could they have got on to Steiner?&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst blow yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you nearly had a worse one, for I believe
they are not far off me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;
&#8220;Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way
</p>
<p>had some inquiries, and when I heard of it I
guessed it was time for me to hustle. But what
</p>
<p>846</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know
these things? Steiner is the fifth man you&#8217;ve lost
since I signed on with you, and I know the name
of the sixth if I don&#8217;t get a move on. How do you
explain it, and ain&#8217;t you ashamed to see your men
go down like this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork flushed crimson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you speak in such a way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t dare things, mister, I wouldn&#8217;t be in
your service. But I&#8217;ll tell you straight what is in
my mind. I&#8217;ve heard that with you German politi-
cians when an agent has done his work you are
not sorry to see him put away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you dare to suggest that I have given away
my own agents!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t stand for that, mister, but there&#8217;s a
stool pigeon or a cross somewhere, and it&#8217;s up to
you to find out where it is. Anyhow I am taking
no more chances. It&#8217;s me for little Holland, and the
sooner the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork had mastered his anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been allies too long to quarrel now at
the very hour of victory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done
splendid work and taken risks, and I can&#8217;t forget
it. By all means go to Holland, and you can get a
boat from Rotterdam to New York. No other line
will be safe a week from now. I&#8217;ll take that book
and pack it with the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The American held the small parcel in his
hand, but made no motion to give it up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the dough?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boodle. The reward. The &#163;500. The gun-
ner turned damned nasty at the last, and I had
to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it
would have been nitsky for you and me. &#8216;Nothin&#8217;
doin&#8217;!&#8217; says he, and he meant it, too, but the last
hundred did it. It&#8217;s cost me two hundred pound
from first to last, so it isn&#8217;t likely I&#8217;d give it up
without gettin&#8217; my wad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork smiled with some bitterness. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t seem to have a very high opinion of my hon-
our,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you want the money before you
give up the book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mister, it is a business proposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Have your way.&#8221; He sat down at the
table and scribbled a check, which he tore from
the book, but he refrained from handing it to his
companion. &#8220;After all, since we are to be on such
terms, Mr. Altamont,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I
</p>
<p>should trust you any more than you trust me. Do
you understand?&#8221; he added, looking back over his
shoulder at the American. &#8220;There&#8217;s the check upon
the table. I claim the right to examine that parcel
before you pick the money up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The American passed it over without a word.
Von Bork undid a winding of string and two wrap-
pers of paper. Then he sat dazing for a moment
in silent amazement at a small blue book which
lay before him. Across the cover was printed
in golden letters Practical Handbook of Bee Culture.
Only for one instant did the master spy glare at
this strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he
was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of
iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in front
of his writhing face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another glass, Watson!&#8221; said Mr. Sherlock
Holmes as he extended the bottle of Imperial
Tokay.
</p>
<p>The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself
by the table, pushed forward his glass with some
eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a good wine, Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon
the sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Josef&#8217;s
special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. Might I
trouble you to open the window, for chloroform
vapour does not help the palate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front
of it was removing dossier after dossier, swiftly ex-
amining each, and then packing it neatly in Von
Bork&#8217;s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleep-
ing stertorously with a strap round his upper arms
and another round his legs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are
safe from interruption. Would you mind touching
the bell? There is no one in the house except old
Martha, who has played her part to admiration. I
got her the situation here when first I took the mat-
ter up. Ah, Martha, you will be glad to hear that
all is well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pleasant old lady had appeared in the
doorway. She curtseyed with a smile to Mr.
Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at
the figure upon the sofa.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right, Martha. He has not been hurt at
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to
his lights he has been a kind master. He wanted
me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but
that would hardly have suited your plans, would
it, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>847</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>His Last Bow
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Martha. So long as you were here
I was easy in my mind. We waited some time for
your signal to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the secretary, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. His car passed ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he would never go. I knew that it
would not suit your plans, sir, to find him here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Well, it only meant that we
waited half an hour or so until I saw your lamp
go out and knew that the coast was clear. You
can report to me to-morrow in London, Martha, at
Claridge&#8217;s Hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have everything ready to
leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. He posted seven letters to-day. I have
the addresses as usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Martha. I will look into them to-
morrow. Good-night. These papers,&#8221; he contin-
ued as the old lady vanished, &#8220;are not of very
great importance, for, of course, the information
which they represent has been sent off long ago to
the German government. These are the originals
which cold not safely be got out of the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they are of no use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not go so far as to say that, Wat-
son. They will at least show our people what is
known and what is not. I may say that a good
many of these papers have come through me, and
I need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy. It
would brighten my declining years to see a Ger-
man cruiser navigating the Solent according to the
mine-field plans which I have furnished. But you,
Watson&#8221;&#8212;he stopped his work and took his old
friend by the shoulders&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ve hardly seen you in
the light yet. How have the years used you? You
look the same blithe boy as ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. I have
seldom felt so happy as when I got your wire ask-
ing me to meet you at Harwich with the car. But
you, Holmes&#8212;you have changed very little&#8212;save
for that horrible goatee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the sacrifices one makes for one&#8217;s
country, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, pulling at his little
tuft. &#8220;To-morrow it will be but a dreadful mem-
ory. With my hair cut and a few other superficial
changes I shall no doubt reappear at Claridge&#8217;s to-
morrow as I was before this American stunt&#8212;I beg
your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems to
be permanently defiled&#8212;before this American job
came my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have retired, Holmes. We heard of
you as living the life of a hermit among your bees
and your books in a small farm upon the South
Downs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my
leisured ease, the magnum opus of my latter years!&#8221;
He picked up the volume from the table and read
out the whole title, Practical Handbook of Bee Cul-
ture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of
the Queen. &#8220;Alone I did it. Behold the fruit of pen-
sive nights and laborious days when I watched the
little working gangs as once I watched the criminal
world of London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get to work again?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, I have often marvelled at it myself. The
</p>
<p>Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but
when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble
roof&#8212;! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman
upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people.
He was in a class by himself. Things were going
wrong, and no one could understand why they
were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even
caught, but there was evidence of some strong and
secret central force. It was absolutely necessary to
expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me
to look into the matter. It has cost me two years,
Watson, but they have not been devoid of excite-
ment. When I say that I started my pilgrimage
at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at
Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at
Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a
subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended
me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter
was complex. Since then I have been honoured by
his confidence, which has not prevented most of
his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best
agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson,
and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope
that you are none the worse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last remark was addressed to Von Bork
himself, who after much gasping and blinking
had lain quietly listening to Holmes&#8217;s statement.
He broke out now into a furious stream of Ger-
man invective, his face convulsed with passion.
Holmes continued his swift investigation of doc-
uments while his prisoner cursed and swore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though unmusical, German is the most ex-
pressive of all languages,&#8221; he observed when Von
Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. &#8220;Hullo!
Hullo!&#8221; he added as he looked hard at the cor-
ner of a tracing before putting it in the box. &#8220;This
should put another bird in the cage. I had no
idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though
I have long had an eye upon him. Mister Von Bork,
you have a great deal to answer for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>848</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The prisoner had raised himself with some
difficulty upon the sofa and was staring with a
strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his
captor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall get level with you, Altamont,&#8221; he said,
speaking with slow deliberation. &#8220;If it takes me all
my life I shall get level with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old sweet song,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;How of-
ten have I heard it in days gone by. It was a
favorite ditty of the late lamented Professor Mo-
riarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been
known to warble it. And yet I live and keep bees
upon the South Downs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse you, you double traitor!&#8221; cried the Ger-
man, straining against his bonds and glaring mur-
der from his furious eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it is not so bad as that,&#8221; said Holmes,
smiling. &#8220;As my speech surely shows you, Mr. Al-
tamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I used
him and he is gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really immaterial who I am, but since the
matter seems to interest you, Mr. Von Bork, I may
say that this is not my first acquaintance with the
members of your family. I have done a good deal
of business in Germany in the past and my name
is probably familiar to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would wish to know it,&#8221; said the Prussian
grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I who brought about the separation be-
tween Irene Adler and the late King of Bohemia
when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial En-
voy. It was I also who saved from murder, by the
Nihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu Grafenstein,
who was your mother&#8217;s elder brother. It was I&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork sat up in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one man,&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa.
&#8220;And most of that information came through
you,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What is it worth? What have I
done? It is my ruin forever!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly a little untrustworthy,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;It will require some checking and you
have little time to check it. Your admiral may find
the new guns rather larger than he expects, and
the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a good many other points of detail
which will, no doubt, come to light in good time.
But you have one quality which is very rare in a
</p>
<p>German, Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and
you will bear me no ill-will when you realize that
you, who have outwitted so many other people,
have at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you
have done your best for your country, and I have
done my best for mine, and what could be more
natural? Besides,&#8221; he added, not unkindly, as he
laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate
man, &#8220;it is better than to fall before some ignoble
foe. These papers are now ready, Watson. If you
will help me with our prisoner, I think that we may
get started for London at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he
was a strong and a desperate man. Finally, hold-
ing either arm, the two friends walked him very
slowly down the garden walk which he had trod
with such proud confidence when he received the
congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a
few hours before. After a short, final struggle he
was hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the
spare seat of the little car. His precious valise was
wedged in beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that you are as comfortable as circum-
stances permit,&#8221; said Holmes when the final ar-
rangements were made. &#8220;Should I be guilty of a
liberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your
lips?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But all amenities were wasted upon the angry
German.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you realize, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that if your government bears you out in
this treatment it becomes an act of war.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about your government and all this
treatment?&#8221; said Holmes, tapping the valise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a private individual. You have no war-
rant for my arrest. The whole proceeding is abso-
lutely illegal and outrageous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Kidnapping a German subject.&#8221;
&#8220;And stealing his private papers.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you realize your position, you and your
</p>
<p>accomplice here. If I were to shout for help as we
pass through the village&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you
would probably enlarge the two limited titles of
our village inns by giving us &#8216;The Dangling Prus-
sian&#8217; as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient
creature, but at present his temper is a little in-
flamed, and it would be as well not to try him too
far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a
quiet, sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence
you can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling,
and see if even now you may not fill that place
</p>
<p>849</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>which he has reserved for you in the ambassado-
rial suite. As to you, Watson, you are joining us
with your old service, as I understand, so London
won&#8217;t be out of your way. Stand with me here
upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk
that we shall ever have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two friends chatted in intimate converse
for a few minutes, recalling once again the days
of the past, while their prisoner vainly wriggled
to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned
to the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea
and shook a thoughtful head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an east wind coming, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, Holmes. It is very warm.&#8221;
&#8220;Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point
</p>
<p>in a changing age. There&#8217;s an east wind coming
all the same, such a wind as never blew on Eng-
land yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a
good many of us may wither before its blast. But
it&#8217;s God&#8217;s own wind none the less, and a cleaner,
better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when
the storm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for
it&#8217;s time that we were on our way. I have a check
for five hundred pounds which should be cashed
early, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it
if he can.&#8221;</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Preface
</p>
<p>I fear that Mr. Sherlock Holmes may become like one of those popular tenors who, hav-
ing outlived their time, are still tempted to make repeated farewell bows to their indulgent
audiences. This must cease and he must go the way of all flesh, material or imaginary. One
likes to think that there is some fantastic limbo for the children of imagination, some strange,
impossible place where the beaux of Fielding may still make love to the belles of Richardson,
where Scott&#8217;s heroes still may strut, Dickens&#8217;s delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and
Thackeray&#8217;s worldlings continue to carry on their reprehensible careers. Perhaps in some
humble corner of such a Valhalla, Sherlock and his Watson may for a time find a place, while
some more astute sleuth with some even less astute comrade may fill the stage which they
have vacated.
</p>
<p>His career has been a long one&#8212;though it is possible to exaggerate it; decrepit gentlemen
who approach me and declare that his adventures formed the reading of their boyhood do
not meet the response from me which they seem to expect. One is not anxious to have one&#8217;s
personal dates handled so unkindly. As a matter of cold fact, Holmes made his debut in A
Study in Scarlet and in The Sign of Four, two small booklets which appeared be
