<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I</p>
<p>n the third week of November, in the
year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled
down upon London. From the Monday
to the Thursday I doubt whether it was
</p>
<p>ever possible from our windows in Baker Street
to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first
day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge
book of references. The second and third had been
patiently occupied upon a subject which he hand
recently made his hobby&#8212;the music of the Mid-
dle Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after
pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw
the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us
and condensing in oily drops upon the window-
panes, my comrade&#8217;s impatient and active nature
could endure this drab existence no longer. He
paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever
of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the
furniture, and chafing against inaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>In was aware that by anything of interest,
Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. There
was the news of a revolution, of a possible war,
and of an impending change of government; but
these did not come within the horizon of my com-
panion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape
of crime which was not commonplace and futile.
Holmes groaned and resumed hs restless mean-
derings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The London criminal is certainly a dull fel-
low,&#8221; said he in the querulous voice of the sports-
man whose game has failed him. &#8220;Look out this
window, Watson. See how the figures loom up,
are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the
cloud-bank. The thief or the murderer could roam
London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle,
unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to
his victim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There have,&#8221; said I, &#8220;been numerous petty
thefts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes snorted his contempt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This great and sombre stage is set for some-
thing more worthy than that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is fortu-
nate for this community that I am not a criminal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed!&#8221; said I heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or
any of the fifty men who have good reason for tak-
ing my life, how long could I survive against my
own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment,
and all would be over. It is well they don&#8217;t have
days of fog in the Latin countries&#8212;the countries
</p>
<p>of assassination. By Jove! here comes something
at last to break our dead monotony.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore
it open and burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! What next?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Brother My-
croft is coming round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car com-
</p>
<p>ing down a country lane. Mycroft has his rails and
he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the Dio-
genes Club, Whitehall&#8212;that is his cycle. Once, and
only once, he has been here. What upheaval can
possibly have derailed him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he not explain?&#8221;
Holmes handed me his brother&#8217;s telegram.
</p>
<p>Must see you over Cadogen West.
Coming at once.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Mycroft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cadogen West? I have heard the name.&#8221;
&#8220;It recalls nothing to my mind. But that My-
</p>
<p>croft should break out in this erratic fashion! A
planet might as well leave its orbit. By the way, do
you know what Mycroft is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had some vague recollection of an explana-
tion at the time of the Adventure of the Greek In-
terpreter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me that he had some small office un-
der the British government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes chuckled.
&#8220;I did not know you quite so well in those days.
</p>
<p>One has to be discreet when one talks of high mat-
ters of state. You are right in thinking that he un-
der the British government. You would also be
right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is
the British government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws
</p>
<p>four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a
subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will
receive neither honour nor title, but remains the
most indispensable man in the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, his position is unique. He has made it
</p>
<p>for himself. There has never been anything like
it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest
and most orderly brain, with the greatest capac-
ity for storing facts, of any man living. The same
great powers which I have turned to the detec-
tion of crime he has used for this particular busi-
ness. The conclusions of every department are
passed to him, and he is the central exchange,
the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>All other men are specialists, but his specialism
is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister
needs information as to a point which involves the
Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question;
he could get his separate advices from various de-
partments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus
them all, and say offhand how each factor would
affect the other. They began by using him as a
short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself
an essential. In that great brain of his everything
is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an in-
stant. Again and again his word has decided the
national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of noth-
ing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he
unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise
me on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is de-
scending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who
is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; I cried, and plunged among the lit-
ter of papers upon the sofa. &#8220;Yes, yes, here he
is, sure enough! Cadogen West was the young
man who was found dead on the Underground on
Tuesday morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to
his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be serious, Watson. A death which
has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no
ordinary one. What in the world can he have to do
with it? The case was featureless as I remember it.
The young man had apparently fallen out of the
train and killed himself. He had not been robbed,
and there was no particular reason to suspect vio-
lence. Is that not so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been an inquest,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and a
good many fresh facts have come out. Looked at
more closely, I should certainly say that it was a
curious case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging by its effect upon my brother, I
should think it must be a most extraordinary one.&#8221;
He snuggled down in his armchair. &#8220;Now, Watson,
let us have the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s name was Arthur Cadogan West.
He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and
a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Government employ. Behold the link with
Brother Mycroft!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.
Was last seen by his fiancee, Miss Violet Westbury,
whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7.30 that
evening. There was no quarrel between them and
she can give no motive for his action. The next
thing heard of him was when his dead body was
</p>
<p>discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just out-
side Aldgate Station on the Underground system
in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;
&#8220;The body was found at six on Tuesday morn-
</p>
<p>ing. It was lying wide of the metals upon the left
hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point
close to the station, where the line emerges from
the tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly
crushed&#8212;an injury which might well have been
caused by a fall from the train. The body could
only have come on the line in that way. Had it
been carried down from any neighbouring street,
it must have passed the station barriers, where a
collector is always standing. This point seems ab-
solutely certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. The case is definite enough. The
man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated
from a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trains which traverse the lines of rail
beside which the body was found are those
which run from west to east, some being purely
Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and out-
lying junctions. It can be stated for certain that this
young man, when he met his death, was travelling
in this direction at some late hour of the night, but
at what point he entered the train it is impossible
to state.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His ticket, of course, would show that.&#8221;
&#8220;There was no ticket in his pockets.&#8221;
&#8220;No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very
</p>
<p>singular. According to my experience it is not pos-
sible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train
without exhibiting one&#8217;s ticket. Presumably, then,
the young man had one. Was it taken from him in
order to conceal the station from which he came?
It is possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage?
That is also possible. But the point is of curious
interest. I understand that there was no sign of
robbery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not. There is a list here of his
possessions. His purse contained two pounds fif-
teen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich
branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through
this his identity was established. There were also
two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre,
dated for that very evening. Also a small packet of
technical papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.
&#8220;There we have it at last, Watson! British
</p>
<p>government&#8212;Woolwich. Arsenal&#8212;technical pa-
pers&#8212;Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. But
here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for
himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>792</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A moment later the tall and portly form of My-
croft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily
built and massive, there was a suggestion of un-
couth physical inertia in the figure, but above this
unwieldy frame there was perched a head so mas-
terful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set
eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play
of expression, that after the first glance one forgot
the gross body and remembered only the domi-
nant mind.
</p>
<p>At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of
Scotland Yard&#8212;thin and austere. The gravity of
both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The
detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft
Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided
into an armchair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A most annoying business, Sherlock,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I extremely dislike altering my habits, but
the powers that be would take no denial. In the
present state of Siam it is most awkward that I
should be away from the office. But it is a real cri-
sis. I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset.
As to the Admiralty&#8212;it is buzzing like an over-
turned bee-hive. Have you read up the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have just done so. What were the technical
papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there&#8217;s the point! Fortunately, it has not
come out. The press would be furious if it did.
The papers which this wretched youth had in his
pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington sub-
marine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which
showed his sense of the importance of the subject.
His brother and I sat expectant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you have heard of it? I thought every-
one had heard of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only as a name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It
has been the most jealously guarded of all govern-
ment secrets. You may take it from me that naval
warfare becomes impossible within the radius of
a Bruce-Partington&#8217;s operation. Two years ago a
very large sum was smuggled through the Esti-
mates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly
of the invention. Every effort has been made to
keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly
intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents,
each essential to the working of the whole, are kept
in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoin-
ing the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and win-
dows. Under no conceivable circumstances were
the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief
constructor of the Navy desired to consult them,
</p>
<p>even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office
for the purpose. And yet here we find them in
the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of
London. From an official point of view it&#8217;s simply
awful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have recovered them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sherlock, no! That&#8217;s the pinch. We have
not. Ten papers were taken from Woolwich. There
were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The
three most essential are gone&#8212;stolen, vanished.
You must drop everything, Sherlock. Never mind
your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It&#8217;s a
vital international problem that you have to solve.
Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are
the missing ones, how did he die, how came his
body where it was found, how can the evil be set
right? Find an answer to all these questions, and
you will have done good service for your country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?
You can see as far as I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of
getting details. Give me your details, and from
an armchair I will return you an excellent expert
opinion. But to run here and run there, to cross-
question railway guards, and lie on my face with
a lens to my eye&#8212;it is not my me&#180;tier. No, you are
the one man who can clear the matter up. If you
have a fancy to see your name in the next honours
list&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend smiled and shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I play the game for the game&#8217;s own sake,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But the problem certainly presents some
points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to
look into it. Some more facts, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have jotted down the more essential ones
upon this sheet of paper, together with a few ad-
dresses which you will find of service. The actual
official guardian of the papers is the famous gov-
ernment expert, Sir James Walter, whose decora-
tions and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of refer-
ence. He has grown gray in the service, is a gentle-
man, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses,
and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond
suspicion. He is one of two who have a key of
the safe. I may add that the papers were undoubt-
edly in the office during working hours on Mon-
day, and that Sir James left for London about three
o&#8217;clock taking his key with him. He was at the
house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square dur-
ing the whole of the evening when this incident
occurred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the fact been verified?&#8221;
</p>
<p>793</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has
testified to his departure from Woolwich, and Ad-
miral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James
is no longer a direct factor in the problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the other man with a key?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sid-
ney Johnson. He is a man of forty, married, with
five children. He is a silent, morose man, but he
has, on the whole, an excellent record in the pub-
lic service. He is unpopular with his colleagues,
but a hard worker. According to his own account,
corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was
at home the whole of Monday evening after office
hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain
upon which it hangs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about Cadogan West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been ten years in the service and has
done good work. He has the reputation of being
hot-headed and imperious, but a straight, honest
man. We have nothing against him. He was next
Sidney Johnson in the office. His duties brought
him into daily, personal contact with the plans. No
one else had the handling of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who locked up the plans that night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them
away. They are actually found upon the person of
this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final,
does it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much
unexplained. In the first place, why did he take
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume they were of value?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He could have got several thousands for them
very easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you suggest any possible motive for tak-
ing the papers to London except to sell them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must take that as our working hy-
pothesis. Young West took the papers. Now this
could only be done by having a false key&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Several false keys. He had to open the build-
ing and the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had, then, several false keys. He took the
papers to London to sell the secret, intending, no
doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the
safe next morning before they were missed. While
in London on this treasonable mission he met his
end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will suppose that he was travelling back to
Woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of
the compartment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aldgate, where the body was found, is con-
siderably past the station London Bridge, which
would be his route to Woolwich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Many circumstances could be imagined under
which he would pass London Bridge. There was
someone in the carriage, for example, with whom
he was having an absorbing interview. This inter-
view led to a violent scene in which he lost his life.
Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on
the line, and so met his end. The other closed the
door. There was a thick fog, and nothing could be
seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No better explanation can be given with our
present knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock,
how much you leave untouched. We will suppose,
for argument&#8217;s sake, that young Cadogan West had
determined to convey these papers to London. He
would naturally have made an appointment with
the foreign agent and kept his evening clear. In-
stead of that he took two tickets for the theatre,
escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then sud-
denly disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A blind,&#8221; said Lestrade, who had sat listening
with some impatience to the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very singular one. That is objection No. 1.
Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches
London and sees the foreign agent. He must bring
back the papers before morning or the loss will be
discovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in
his pocket. What had become of the other three?
He certainly would not leave them of his own free
will. Then, again, where is the price of his treason?
Once would have expected to find a large sum of
money in his pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me perfectly clear,&#8221; said Lestrade.
&#8220;I have no doubt at all as to what occurred. He
took the papers to sell them. He saw the agent.
They could not agree as to price. He started home
again, but the agent went with him. In the train the
agent murdered him, took the more essential pa-
pers, and threw his body from the carriage. That
would account for everything, would it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why had he no ticket?&#8221;
&#8220;The ticket would have shown which station
</p>
<p>was nearest the agent&#8217;s house. Therefore he took
it from the murdered man&#8217;s pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, Lestrade, very good,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Your theory holds together. But if this is true,
then the case is at an end. On the one hand,
the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of
the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably
</p>
<p>794</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>already on the Continent. What is there for us to
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To act, Sherlock&#8212;to act!&#8221; cried Mycroft,
springing to his feet. &#8220;All my instincts are against
this explanation. Use your powers! Go to the scene
of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no
stone unturned! In all your career you have never
had so great a chance of serving your country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said Holmes, shrugging his shoul-
ders. &#8220;Come, Watson! And you, Lestrade, could
you favour us with your company for an hour or
two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to
Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you
have a report before evening, but I warn you in
advance that you have little to expect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood
upon the Underground railroad at the point where
it emerges from the tunnel immediately before
Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gen-
tleman represented the railway company.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where the young man&#8217;s body lay,&#8221; said
he, indicating a spot about three feet from the met-
als. &#8220;It could not have fallen from above, for these,
as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could
only have come from a train, and that train, so far
as we can trace it, must have passed about mid-
night on Monday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the carriages been examined for any
sign of violence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no such signs, and no ticket has
been found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No record of a door being found open?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had some fresh evidence this morn-
ing,&#8221; said Lestrade. &#8220;A passenger who passed
Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about
11.40 on Monday night declares that he heard a
heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just be-
fore the train reached the station. There was dense
fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made
no report of it at the time. Why, whatever is the
matter with Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend was standing with an expression of
strained intensity upon his face, staring at the rail-
way metals where they curved out of the tunnel.
Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of
points. On these his eager, questioning eyes were
fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tight-
ening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and
concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I
knew so well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Points,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;the points.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it? What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there are no great number of points
on a system such as this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they are very few.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove!
if it were only so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An idea&#8212;an indication, no more. But the
case certainly grows in interest. Unique, perfectly
unique, and yet why not? I do not see any indica-
tions of bleeding on the line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were hardly any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I understand that there was a considerable
wound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The bone was crushed, but there was no great
external injury.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet one would have expected some bleed-
ing. Would it be possible for me to inspect the
train which contained the passenger who heard
the thud of a fall in the fog?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been
broken up before now, and the carriages redis-
tributed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said Lestrade,
&#8220;that every carriage has been carefully examined.
I saw to it myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was one of my friend&#8217;s most obvious weak-
nesses that he was impatient with less alert intelli-
gences than his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said he, turning away. &#8220;As it hap-
pens, it was not the carriages which I desired to
examine. Watson, we have done all we can here.
We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.
I think our investigations must now carry us to
Woolwich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram
to his brother, which he handed to me before dis-
patching it. It ran thus:
</p>
<p>See some light in the darkness, but it
may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile,
please send by messenger, to await re-
turn at Baker Street, a complete list of
all foreign spies or international agents
known to be in England, with full ad-
dress.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Sherlock.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>&#8220;That should be helpful, Watson,&#8221; he remarked
as we took our seats in the Woolwich train. &#8220;We
certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having in-
troduced us to what promises to be a really very
remarkable case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eager face still wore that expression of in-
tense and high-strung energy, which showed me
that some novel and suggestive circumstance had
opened up a stimulating line of thought. See the
foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as
it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the
same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining
muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent&#8212;such
was the change in Holmes since the morning. He
was a different man from the limp and lounging
figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who
had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before
round the fog-girt room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is material here. There is scope,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I am dull indeed not to have understood its
possibilities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even now they are dark to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of
one idea which may lead us far. The man met his
death elsewhere, and his body was on the roof of a
carriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the roof!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts.
Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point
where the train pitches and sways as it comes
round on the points? Is not that the place where an
object upon the roof might be expected to fall off?
The points would affect no object inside the train.
Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curi-
ous coincidence has occurred. But now consider
the question of the blood. Of course, there was
no bleeding on the line if the body had bled else-
where. Each fact is suggestive in itself. Together
they have a cumulative force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the ticket, too!&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. We could not explain the absence of
a ticket. This would explain it. Everything fits to-
gether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose it were so, we are still as far as
ever from unravelling the mystery of his death. In-
deed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Holmes, thoughtfully, &#8220;per-
haps.&#8221; He relapsed into a silent reverie, which
lasted until the slow train drew up at last in Wool-
wich Station. There he called a cab and drew My-
croft&#8217;s paper from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have quite a little round of afternoon calls
to make,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I think that Sir James Walter
claims our first attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house of the famous official was a fine villa
with green lawns stretching down to the Thames.
As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin,
watery sunshine was breaking through. A butler
answered our ring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir James, sir!&#8221; said he with solemn face. &#8220;Sir
James died this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; cried Holmes in amazement.
&#8220;How did he die?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see
his brother, Colonel Valentine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we had best do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room,
where an instant later we were joined by a very
tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the
younger brother of the dead scientist. His wild
eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke
of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the
household. He was hardly articulate as he spoke
of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was this horrible scandal,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My
brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive
honour, and he could not survive such an affair.
It broke his heart. He was always so proud of the
efficiency of his department, and this was a crush-
ing blow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had hoped that he might have given us
some indications which would have helped us to
clear the matter up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you that it was all a mystery to him
as it is to you and to all of us. He had already
put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police.
Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was
guilty. But all the rest was inconceivable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot throw any new light upon the af-
fair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing myself save what I have read
or heard. I have no desire to be discourteous,
but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are
much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to
hasten this interview to an end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is indeed an unexpected development,&#8221;
said my friend when we had regained the cab. &#8220;I
wonder if the death was natural, or whether the
poor old fellow killed himself! If the latter, may it
be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty ne-
glected? We must leave that question to the future.
Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>796</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of
the town sheltered the bereaved mother. The old
lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to
us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady,
who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury,
the fiancee of the dead man, and the last to see
him upon that fatal night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking,
thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true
meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-
minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He
would have cut his right hand off before he would
sell a State secret confided to his keeping. It is
absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who
knew him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the facts, Miss Westbury?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he in any want of money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; his needs were very simple and his salary
ample. He had saved a few hundreds, and we were
to marry at the New Year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No signs of any mental excitement? Come,
Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The quick eye of my companion had noted
some change in her manner. She coloured and hes-
itated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I had a feeling that
there was something on his mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for the last week or so. He was thought-
ful and worried. Once I pressed him about it. He
admitted that there was something, and that it was
concerned with his official life. &#8217;It is too serious for
me to speak about, even to you,&#8217; said he. I could
get nothing more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes looked grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell
against him, go on. We cannot say what it may
lead to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or
twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of
telling me something. He spoke one evening of the
importance of the secret, and I have some recollec-
tion that he said that no doubt foreign spies would
pay a great deal to have it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend&#8217;s face grew graver still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that we were slack about such mat-
ters&#8212;that it would be easy for a traitor to get the
plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it only recently that he made such re-
marks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, quite recently.&#8221;
&#8220;Now tell us of that last evening.&#8221;
&#8220;We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so
</p>
<p>thick that a cab was useless. We walked, and our
way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted
away into the fog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a word?&#8221;
&#8220;He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited
</p>
<p>but he never returned. Then I walked home. Next
morning, after the office opened, they came to in-
quire. About twelve o&#8217;clock we heard the terrible
news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save
his honour! It was so much to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head sadly.
&#8220;Come, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;our ways lie else-
</p>
<p>where. Our next station must be the office from
which the papers were taken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was black enough before against this young
man, but our inquiries make it blacker,&#8221; he re-
marked as the cab lumbered off. &#8220;His coming mar-
riage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally
wanted money. The idea was in his head, since he
spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accom-
plice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all
very bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, Holmes, character goes for some-
thing? Then, again, why should he leave the girl
in the street and dart away to commit a felony?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it
is a formidable case which they have to meet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at
the office and received us with that respect which
my companion&#8217;s card always commanded. He was
a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his
cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the
nervous strain to which he had been subjected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you
heard of the death of the chief?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have just come from his house.&#8221;
&#8220;The place is disorganized. The chief dead,
</p>
<p>Cadogan West dead, our papers stolen. And yet,
when we closed our door on Monday evening, we
were as efficient an office as any in the government
service. Good God, it&#8217;s dreadful to think of! That
West, of all men, should have done such a thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure of his guilt, then?&#8221;
&#8220;I can see no other way out of it. And yet I
</p>
<p>would have trusted him as I trust myself.&#8221;
&#8220;At what hour was the office closed on Mon-
</p>
<p>day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>797</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>&#8220;At five.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you close it?&#8221;
&#8220;I am always the last man out.&#8221;
&#8220;Where were the plans?&#8221;
&#8220;In that safe. I put them there myself.&#8221;
&#8220;Is there no watchman to the building?&#8221;
&#8220;There is, but he has other departments to look
</p>
<p>after as well. He is an old soldier and a most trust-
worthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of
course the fog was very thick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make
his way into the building after hours; he would
need three keys, would he not, before the could
reach the papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the
key of the office, and the key of the safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Sir James Walter and you had those
keys?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no keys of the doors&#8212;only of the safe.&#8221;
&#8220;Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his
</p>
<p>habits?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those
</p>
<p>three keys are concerned he kept them on the same
ring. I have often seen them there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that ring went with him to London?&#8221;
&#8220;He said so.&#8221;
&#8220;And your key never left your possession?&#8221;
&#8220;Never.&#8221;
&#8220;Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a
</p>
<p>duplicate. And yet none was found upon his body.
One other point: if a clerk in this office desired to
sell the plans, would it not be simply to copy the
plans for himself than to take the originals, as was
actually done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take considerable technical knowl-
edge to copy the plans in an effective way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West
has that technical knowledge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt we had, but I beg you won&#8217;t try to
drag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the
use of our speculating in this way when the origi-
nal plans were actually found on West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is certainly singular that he should run
the risk of taking originals if he could safely have
taken copies, which would have equally served his
turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Singular, no doubt&#8212;and yet he did so.&#8221;
&#8220;Every inquiry in this case reveals something
</p>
<p>inexplicable. Now there are three papers still miss-
ing. They are, as I understand, the vital ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is so.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you mean to say that anyone holding these
</p>
<p>three papers, and without the seven others, could
construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But
to-day I have been over the drawings again, and I
am not so sure of it. The double valves with the
automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of
the papers which have been returned. Until the
foreigners had invented that for themselves they
could not make the boat. Of course they might
soon get over the difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the three missing drawings are the most
important?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#8221;
&#8220;I think, with your permission, I will now take
</p>
<p>a stroll round the premises. I do not recall any
other question which I desired to ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He examined the lock of the safe, the door of
the room, and finally the iron shutters of the win-
dow. It was only when we were on the lawn out-
side that his interest was strongly excited. There
was a laurel bush outside the window, and several
of the branches bore signs of having been twisted
or snapped. He examined them carefully with his
lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon
the earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief clerk
to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to
me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it
would be possible for anyone outside to see what
was going on within the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The indications are ruined by three days&#8217; de-
lay. They may mean something or nothing. Well,
Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us
further. It is a small crop which we have gathered.
Let us see if we can do better in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest
before we left Woolwich Station. The clerk in the
ticket office was able to say with confidence that
he saw Cadogan West&#8212;whom he knew well by
sight&#8212;upon the Monday night, and that he went
to London by the 8.15 to London Bridge. He was
alone and took a single third-class ticket. The clerk
was struck at the time by his excited and nervous
manner. So shaky was he that he could hardly pick
up his change, and the clerk had helped him with
it. A reference to the timetable showed that the
8.15 was the first train which it was possible for
West to take after he had left the lady about 7.30.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us reconstruct, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes after
half an hour of silence. &#8220;I am not aware that in all
our joint researches we have ever had a case which
was more difficult to get at. Every fresh advance
which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond.
</p>
<p>798</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>And yet we have surely made some appreciable
progress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in
the main been against young Cadogan West; but
the indications at the window would lend them-
selves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us sup-
pose, for example, that he had been approached
by some foreign agent. It might have been done
under such pledges as would have prevented him
from speaking of it, and yet would have affected
his thoughts in the direction indicated by his re-
marks to his fiancee. Very good. We will now sup-
pose that as he went to the theatre with the young
lady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of
this same agent going in the direction of the of-
fice. He was an impetuous man, quick in his de-
cisions. Everything gave way to his duty. He fol-
lowed the man, reached the window, saw the ab-
straction of the documents, and pursued the thief.
In this way we get over the objection that no one
would take originals when he could make copies.
This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds
together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the next step?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we come into difficulties. One would
imagine that under such circumstances the first act
of young Cadogan West would be to seize the vil-
lain and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so?
Could it have been an official superior who took
the papers? That would explain West&#8217;s conduct.
Or could the chief have given West the slip in the
fog, and West started at once to London to head
him off from his own rooms, presuming that he
knew where the rooms were? The call must have
been very pressing, since he left his girl standing
in the fog and made no effort to communicate with
her. Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast
gap between either hypothesis and the laying of
West&#8217;s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on
the roof of a Metropolitan train. My instinct now
is to work form the other end. If Mycroft has given
us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our
man and follow two tracks instead of one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker
Street. A government messenger had brought it
post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it over
to me.
</p>
<p>There are numerous small fry, but few
who would handle so big an affair.
The only men worth considering are
Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great George
Street, Westminster; Louis La Roth-
iere, of Campden Mansions, Notting
</p>
<p>Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield
Gardens, Kensington. The latter was
known to be in town on Monday and
is now reported as having left. Glad
to hear you have seen some light. The
Cabinet awaits your final report with
the utmost anxiety. Urgent representa-
tions have arrived from the very high-
est quarter. The whole force of the State
is at your back if you should need it.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Mycroft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said Holmes, smiling, &#8220;that all
the queen&#8217;s horses and all the queen&#8217;s men can-
not avail in this matter.&#8221; He had spread out his
big map of London and leaned eagerly over it.
&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said he presently with an exclama-
tion of satisfaction, &#8220;things are turning a little in
our direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly
believe that we are going to pull it off, after all.&#8221; He
slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst
of hilarity. &#8220;I am going out now. It is only a recon-
naissance. I will do nothing serious without my
trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do
you stay here, and the odds are that you will see
me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy
get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative
of how we saved the State.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I felt some reflection of his elation in my own
mind, for I knew well that he would not depart
so far from his usual austerity of demeanour un-
less there was good cause for exultation. All the
long November evening I waited, filled with im-
patience for his return. At last, shortly after nine
o&#8217;clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:
</p>
<p>Am dining at Goldini&#8217;s Restaurant,
Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please
come at once and join me there. Bring
with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a
chisel, and a revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8212; S.H.
</p>
<p>It was a nice equipment for a respectable citi-
zen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets.
I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat
and drove straight to the address given. There sat
my friend at a little round table near the door of
the garish Italian restaurant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you had something to eat? Then join me
in a coffee and curacao. Try one of the proprietor&#8217;s
cigars. They are less poisonous than one would ex-
pect. Have you the tools?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are here, in my overcoat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>799</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of
what I have done, with some indication of what
we are about to do. Now it must be evident to you,
Watson, that this young man&#8217;s body was placed on
the roof of the train. That was clear from the in-
stant that I determined the fact that it was from the
roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it not have been dropped from a
bridge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it was impossible. If you exam-
ine the roofs you will find that they are slightly
rounded, and there is no railing round them.
Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cado-
gan West was placed on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could he be placed there?&#8221;
&#8220;That was the question which we had to an-
</p>
<p>swer. There is only one possible way. You are
aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels
at some points in the West End. I had a vague
memory that as I have travelled by it I have occa-
sionally seen windows just above my head. Now,
suppose that a train halted under such a window,
would there be any difficulty in laying a body
upon the roof?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems most improbable.&#8221;
&#8220;We must fall back upon the old axiom that
</p>
<p>when all other contingencies fail, whatever re-
mains, however improbable, must be the truth.
Here all other contingencies have failed. When I
found that the leading international agent, who
had just left London, lived in a row of houses
which abutted upon the Underground, I was so
pleased that you were a little astonished at my
sudden frivolity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was it, was it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13
</p>
<p>Caulfield Gardens, had become my objective. I
began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,
where a very helpful official walked with me along
the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not
only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gar-
dens open on the line but the even more essential
fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the
larger railways, the Underground trains are fre-
quently held motionless for some minutes at that
very spot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!&#8221;
&#8220;So far&#8212;so far, Watson. We advance, but the
</p>
<p>goal is afar. Well, having seen the back of Caulfield
Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied myself
that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable
house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the
upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single
</p>
<p>valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in
his confidence. We must bear in mind that Ober-
stein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his
booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had
no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an am-
ateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur
to him. Yet that is precisely what we are about to
make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?&#8221;
&#8220;Hardly on the evidence.&#8221;
&#8220;What can we hope to do?&#8221;
&#8220;We cannot tell what correspondence may be
</p>
<p>there.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the
</p>
<p>street. I&#8217;ll do the criminal part. It&#8217;s not a time to
stick at trifles. Think of Mycroft&#8217;s note, of the Ad-
miralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits
for news. We are bound to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My answer was to rise from the table.
&#8220;You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go.&#8221;
He sprang up and shook me by the hand.
&#8220;I knew you would not shrink at the last,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes
which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever
seen. The next instant he was his masterful, prac-
tical self once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.
Let us walk,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t drop the instru-
ments, I beg. Your arrest as a suspicious character
would be a most unfortunate complication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of
flat-faced pillared, and porticoed houses which are
so prominent a product of the middle Victorian
epoch in the West End of London. Next door there
appeared to be a children&#8217;s party, for the merry
buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano
resounded through the night. The fog still hung
about and screened us with its friendly shade.
Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the
massive door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a serious proposition,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It
is certainly bolted as well as locked. We would
do better in the area. There is an excellent arch-
way down yonder in case a too zealous policeman
should intrude. Give me a hand, Watson, and I&#8217;ll
do the same for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute later we were both in the area.
Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before
the step of the policeman was heard in the fog
above. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set
to work upon the lower door. I saw him stoop and
strain until with a sharp crash it flew open. We
</p>
<p>800</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>sprang through into the dark passage, closing the
area door behind us. Holmes let the way up the
curving, uncarpeted stair. His little fan of yellow
light shone upon a low window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are, Watson&#8212;this must be the one.&#8221;
He threw it open, and as he did so there was a low,
harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar
as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes
swept his light along the window-sill. It was
thickly coated with soot from the passing engines,
but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in
places.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see where they rested the body. Hal-
loa, Watson! what is this? There can be no doubt
that it is a blood mark.&#8221; He was pointing to faint
discolourations along the woodwork of the win-
dow. &#8220;Here it is on the stone of the stair also. The
demonstration is complete. Let us stay here until
a train stops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had not long to wait. The very next train
roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the
open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled
up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet
from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages.
Holmes softly closed the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far we are justified,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What do you
think of it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A masterpiece. You have never risen to a
greater height.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot agree with you there. From the mo-
ment that I conceived the idea of the body being
upon the roof, which surely was not a very ab-
struse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were
not for the grave interests involved the affair up
to this point would be insignificant. Our difficul-
ties are still before us. But perhaps we may find
something here which may help us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered
the suite of rooms upon the first floor. One was
a dining-room, severely furnished and containing
nothing of interest. A second was a bedroom,
which also drew blank. The remaining room ap-
peared more promising, and my companion set-
tled down to a systematic examination. It was lit-
tered with books and papers, and was evidently
used as a study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes
turned over the contents of drawer after drawer
and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of suc-
cess came to brighten his austere face. At the end
of an hour he was no further than when he started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cunning dog has covered his tracks,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;He has left nothing to incriminate him. His
</p>
<p>dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or
removed. This is our last chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon
the writing-desk. Holmes pried it open with his
chisel. Several rolls of paper were within, cov-
ered with figures and calculations, without any
note to show to what they referred. The recur-
ring words, &#8220;water pressure&#8221; and &#8220;pressure to the
square inch&#8221; suggested some possible relation to
a submarine. Holmes tossed them all impatiently
aside. There only remained an envelope with some
small newspaper slips inside it. He shook them
out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager
face that his hopes had been raised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Watson? Eh? What&#8217;s this? Record
of a series of messages in the advertisements of
a paper. Daily Telegraph agony column by the
print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page.
No dates&#8212;but messages arrange themselves. This
must be the first:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed
to. Write fully to address given on card.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Pierrot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next comes:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too complex for description. Must
have full report, Stuff awaits you when
goods delivered.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Pierrot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then comes:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter presses. Must withdraw offer
unless contract completed. Make ap-
pointment by letter. Will confirm by
advertisement.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Pierrot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Monday night after nine. Two taps.
Only ourselves. Do not be so suspi-
cious. Payment in hard cash when
goods delivered.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Pierrot.
</p>
<p>801</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could
only get at the man at the other end!&#8221; He sat lost in
thought, tapping his fingers on the table. Finally
he sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps it won&#8217;t be so difficult, after all.
There is nothing more to be done here, Watson. I
think we might drive round to the offices of the
Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day&#8217;s work
to a conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round
by appointment after breakfast next day and Sher-
lock Holmes had recounted to them our proceed-
ings of the day before. The professional shook his
head over our confessed burglary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do these things in the force, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;No wonder you get results that
are beyond us. But some of these days you&#8217;ll go
too far, and you&#8217;ll find yourself and your friend in
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For England, home and beauty&#8212;eh, Watson?
Martyrs on the altar of our country. But what do
you think of it, Mycroft?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use
will you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which
lay upon the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Pierrot&#8217;s advertisement to-
day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Another one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here it is:
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night. Same hour. Same place.
Two taps. Most vitally important. Your
own safety at stake.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Pierrot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; cried Lestrade. &#8220;If he answers
that we&#8217;ve got him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my idea when I put it in. I think if
you could both make it convenient to come with us
about eight o&#8217;clock to Caulfield Gardens we might
possibly get a little nearer to a solution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of
Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his
brain out of action and switching all his thoughts
on to lighter things whenever he had convinced
himself that he could no longer work to advan-
tage. I remember that during the whole of that
memorable day he lost himself in a monograph
which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic
Motets of Lassus. For my own part I had none
</p>
<p>of this power of detachment, and the day, in con-
sequence, appeared to be interminable. The great
national importance of the issue, the suspense in
high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment
which we were trying&#8212;all combined to work upon
my nerve. It was a relief to me when at last, af-
ter a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.
Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at
the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area
door of Oberstein&#8217;s house had been left open the
night before, and it was necessary for me, as My-
croft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined
to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall
door. By nine o&#8217;clock we were all seated in the
study, waiting patently for our man.
</p>
<p>An hour passed and yet another. When eleven
struck, the measured beat of the great church clock
seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade
and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and look-
ing twice a minute at their watches. Holmes sat
silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but ev-
ery sense on the alert. He raised his head with a
sudden jerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming,&#8221; said he.
There had been a furtive step past the door.
</p>
<p>Now it returned. We heard a shuffling sound out-
side, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.
Holmes rose, motioning us to remain seated. The
gas in the hall was a mere point of light. He
opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure
slipped past him he closed and fastened it. &#8220;This
way!&#8221; we heard him say, and a moment later our
man stood before us. Holmes had followed him
closely, and as the man turned with a cry of sur-
prise and alarm he caught him by the collar and
threw him back into the room. Before our pris-
oner had recovered his balance the door was shut
and Holmes standing with his back against it. The
man glared round him, staggered, and fell sense-
less upon the floor. With the shock, his broad-
brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped
sown from his lips, and there were the long light
beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of
Colonel Valentine Walter.
</p>
<p>Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.
&#8220;You can write me down an ass this time, Wat-
</p>
<p>son,&#8221; said he. &#8220;This was not the bird that I was
looking for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Mycroft eagerly.
&#8220;The younger brother of the late Sir James Wal-
</p>
<p>ter, the head of the Submarine Department. Yes,
yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to.
I think that you had best leave his examination to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>802</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.
Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with
a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over
his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own
senses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I came here to visit
Mr. Oberstein.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is known, Colonel Walter,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;How an English gentleman could be-
have in such a manner is beyond my comprehen-
sion. But your whole correspondence and relations
with Oberstein are within our knowledge. So also
are the circumstances connected with the death of
young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain
at least the small credit for repentance and con-
fession, since there are still some details which we
can only learn from your lips.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man groaned and sank his face in his
hands. We waited, but he was silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that every es-
sential is already known. We know that you were
pressed for money; that you took an impress of the
keys which your brother held; and that you en-
tered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who
answered your letters through the advertisement
columns of the Daily Telegraph. We are aware that
you went down to the office in the fog on Mon-
day night, but that you were seen and followed
by young Cadogan West, who had probably some
previous reason to suspect you. He saw your theft,
but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible
that you were taking the papers to your brother in
London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the
good citizen that he was, he followed you closely
in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached
this very house. There he intervened, and then it
was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the
more terrible crime of murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I
did not!&#8221; cried our wretched prisoner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end
before you laid him upon the roof of a railway car-
riage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the
rest. I confess it. It was just as you say. A Stock
Exchange debt had to be paid. I needed the money
badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It was
to save myself from ruin. But as to murder, I am
as innocent as you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had his suspicions before, and he followed
me as you describe. I never knew it until I was
at the very door. It was thick fog, and one could
</p>
<p>not see three yards. I had given two taps and Ober-
stein had come to the door. The young man rushed
up and demanded to know what we were about to
do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-
preserver. He always carried it with him. As West
forced his way after us into the house Oberstein
struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one.
He was dead within five minutes. There he lay
in the hall, and we were at our wit&#8217;s end what to
do. Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains
which halted under his back window. But first he
examined the papers which I had brought. He said
that three of them were essential, and that he must
keep them. &#8217;You cannot keep them,&#8217; said I. &#8217;Ther
