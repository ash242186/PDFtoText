<p>n recording from time to time some of
the curious experiences and interesting
recollections which I associate with my
long and intimate friendship with Mr.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by
difficulties caused by his own aversion to public-
ity. To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular ap-
plause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused
him more at the end of a successful case than to
hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox
official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the
general chorus of misplaced congratulation. It was
indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend
and certainly not any lack of interesting material
which has caused me of late years to lay very few
of my records before the public. My participation
in some if his adventures was always a privilege
which entailed discretion and reticence upon me.
</p>
<p>It was, then, with considerable surprise that I
received a telegram from Homes last Tuesday&#8212;he
has never been known to write where a telegram
would serve&#8212;in the following terms:
</p>
<p>Why not tell them of the Cornish hor-
ror&#8212;strangest case I have handled.
</p>
<p>I have no idea what backward sweep of mem-
ory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or
what freak had caused him to desire that I should
recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling
telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which
give me the exact details of the case and to lay the
narrative before my readers.
</p>
<p>It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that
Holmes&#8217;s iron constitution showed some symp-
toms of giving way in the face of constant hard
work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps,
by occasional indiscretions of his own. In March of
that year Dr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose
dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day
recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous
private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender
himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an
absolute breakdown. The state of his health was
not a matter in which he himself took the faintest
interest, for his mental detachment was absolute,
but he was induced at last, on the threat of being
permanently disqualified from work, to give him-
self a complete change of scene and air. Thus it
was that in the early spring of that year we found
ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu
Bay, at the further extremity of the Cornish penin-
sula.
</p>
<p>It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well
suited to the grim humour of my patient. From
</p>
<p>the windows of our little whitewashed house,
which stood high upon a grassy headland, we
looked down upon the whole sinister semicircle
of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing ves-
sels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept
reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their
end. With a northerly breeze it lies placid and shel-
tered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it
for rest and protection.
</p>
<p>Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind,
the blistering gale from the south-west, the drag-
ging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in
the creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands
far out from that evil place.
</p>
<p>On the land side our surroundings were as
sombre as on the sea. It was a country of rolling
moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional
church tower to mark the site of some old-world
village. In every direction upon these moors
there were traces of some vanished race which
had passed utterly away, and left as it sole record
strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds
which contained the burned ashes of the dead,
and curious earthworks which hinted at prehis-
toric strife. The glamour and mystery of the place,
with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations,
appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he
spent much of his time in long walks and soli-
tary meditations upon the moor. The ancient Cor-
nish language had also arrested his attention, and
he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it
was akin to the Chaldean, and had been largely
derived from the Phoenician traders in tin. He
had received a consignment of books upon philol-
ogy and was settling down to develop this thesis
when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned
delight, we found ourselves, even in that land
of dreams, plunged into a problem at our very
doors which was more intense, more engrossing,
and infinitely more mysterious than any of those
which had driven us from London. Our simple life
and peaceful, healthy routine were violently inter-
rupted, and we were precipitated into the midst
of a series of events which caused the utmost ex-
citement not only in Cornwall but throughout the
whole west of England. Many of my readers may
retain some recollection of what was called at the
time &#8220;The Cornish Horror,&#8221; though a most im-
perfect account of the matter reached the London
press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true
details of this inconceivable affair to the public.
</p>
<p>I have said that scattered towers marked the
villages which dotted this part of Cornwall. The

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Devil&#8217;s Foot
</p>
<p>nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wol-
las, where the cottages of a couple of hundred in-
habitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown
church. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay,
was something of an archaeologist, and as such
Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a
middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a con-
siderable fund of local lore. At his invitation we
had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to
know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an indepen-
dent gentleman, who increased the clergyman&#8217;s
scanty resources by taking rooms in his large,
straggling house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was
glad to come to such an arrangement, though he
had little in common with his lodger, who was
a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which
gave the impression of actual, physical deformity.
I remember that during our short visit we found
the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reti-
cent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with
averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own
affairs.
</p>
<p>These were the two men who entered abruptly
into our little sitting-room on Tuesday, March the
16th, shortly after our breakfast hour, as we were
smoking together, preparatory to our daily excur-
sion upon the moors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the vicar in an agitated
voice, &#8220;the most extraordinary and tragic affair has
occurred during the night. It is the most unheard-
of business. We can only regard it as a special
Providence that you should chance to be here at
the time, for in all England you are the one man
we need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very
friendly eyes; but Holmes took his pipe from his
lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who
hears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the
sofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated
companion sat side by side upon it. Mr. Mortimer
Tregennis was more self-contained than the cler-
gyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and
the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they
shared a common emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I speak or you?&#8221; he asked of the vicar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as you seem to have made the discov-
ery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have
had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the
speaking,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with
the formally dressed lodger seated beside him,
and was amused at the surprise which Holmes&#8217;s
simple deduction had brought to their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had best say a few words first,&#8221; said
the vicar, &#8220;and then you can judge if you will lis-
ten to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or whether
we should not hasten at once to the scene of this
mysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our
friend here spent last evening in the company of
his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sis-
ter Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha,
which is near the old stone cross upon the moor.
He left them shortly after ten o&#8217;clock, playing cards
round the dining-room table, in excellent health
and spirits. This morning, being an early riser, he
walked in that direction before breakfast and was
overtaken by the carriage of Dr. Richards, who ex-
plained that he had just been sent for on a most
urgent call to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer
Tregennis naturally went with him. When he ar-
rived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordi-
nary state of things. His two brothers and his sister
were seated round the table exactly as he had left
them, the cards still spread in front of them and
the candles burned down to their sockets. The sis-
ter lay back stone-dead in her chair, while the two
brothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting,
and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.
All three of them, the dead woman and the two de-
mented men, retained upon their faces an expres-
sion of the utmost horror&#8212;a convulsion of terror
which was dreadful to look upon. There was no
sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except
Mrs. Porter, the old cook and housekeeper, who
declared that she had slept deeply and heard no
sound during the night. Nothing had been stolen
or disarranged, and there is absolutely no expla-
nation of what the horror can be which has fright-
ened a woman to death and two strong men out of
their senses. There is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in
a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you
will have done a great work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had hoped that in some way I could coax my
companion back into the quiet which had been the
object of our journey; but one glance at his in-
tense face and contracted eyebrows told me how
vain was now the expectation. He sat for some lit-
tle time in silence, absorbed in the strange drama
which had broken in upon our peace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will look into this matter,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;On the face of it, it would appear to be a case
of a very exceptional nature. Have you been there
yourself, Mr. Roundhay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back
the account to the vicarage, and I at once hurried
over with him to consult you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to the house where this singular
tragedy occurred?&#8221;
</p>
<p>830</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;About a mile inland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall walk over together. But before
we start I must ask you a few questions, Mr. Mor-
timer Tregennis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other had been silent all this time, but I
had observed that his more controlled excitement
was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of
the clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face,
his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin
hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips
quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience
which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes
seemed to reflect something of the horror of the
scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he ea-
gerly. &#8220;It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will
answer you the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar
has said, and my elder brother George proposed a
game of whist afterwards. We sat down about nine
o&#8217;clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to
go. I left them all round the table, as merry as
could be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who let you out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself
out. I shut the hall door behind me. The window
of the room in which they sat was closed, but the
blind was not drawn down. There was no change
in door or window this morning, or any reason to
think that any stranger had been to the house. Yet
there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and
Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hang-
ing over the arm of the chair. I&#8217;ll never get the sight
of that room out of my mind so long as I live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The facts, as you state them, are certainly most
remarkable,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I take it that you have
no theory yourself which can in any way account
for them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!&#8221; cried
Mortimer Tregennis. &#8220;It is not of this world. Some-
thing has come into that room which has dashed
the light of reason from their minds. What human
contrivance could do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that if the matter is be-
yond humanity it is certainly beyond me. Yet we
must exhaust all natural explanations before we
fall back upon such a theory as this. As to your-
self, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in
some way from your family, since they lived to-
gether and you had rooms apart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is
past and done with. We were a family of tin-
miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a
company, and so retired with enough to keep us. I
won&#8217;t deny that there was some feeling about the
division of the money and it stood between us for
a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and
we were the best of friends together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking back at the evening which you spent
together, does anything stand out in your memory
as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy?
Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which
can help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing at all, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Your people were in their usual spirits?&#8221;
&#8220;Never better.&#8221;
&#8220;Were they nervous people? Did they ever
</p>
<p>show any apprehension of coming danger?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing of the kind.&#8221;
&#8220;You have nothing to add then, which could
</p>
<p>assist me?&#8221;
Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a
</p>
<p>moment.
&#8220;There is one thing occurs to me,&#8221; said he at
</p>
<p>last. &#8220;As we sat at the table my back was to the
window, and my brother George, he being my
partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once
look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and
looked also. The blind was up and the window
shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the
lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw
something moving among them. I couldn&#8217;t even
say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there
was something there. When I asked him what he
was looking at, he told me that he had the same
feeling. That is all that I can say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not investigate?&#8221;
&#8220;No; the matter passed as unimportant.&#8221;
&#8220;You left them, then, without any premonition
</p>
<p>of evil?&#8221;
&#8220;None at all.&#8221;
&#8220;I am not clear how you came to hear the news
</p>
<p>so early this morning.&#8221;
&#8220;I am an early riser and generally take a walk
</p>
<p>before breakfast. This morning I had hardly
started when the doctor in his carriage overtook
me. He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a
boy down with an urgent message. I sprang in
beside him and we drove on. When we got there
we looked into that dreadful room. The candles
and the fire must have burned out hours before,
and they had been sitting there in the dark until
dawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must
have been dead at least six hours. There were no
</p>
<p>831</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Devil&#8217;s Foot
</p>
<p>signs of violence. She just lay across the arm of the
chair with that look on her face. George and Owen
were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like
two great apes. Oh, it was awful to see! I couldn&#8217;t
stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet.
Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and
we nearly had him on our hands as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable&#8212;most remarkable!&#8221; said
Holmes, rising and taking his hat. &#8220;I think, per-
haps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha
without further delay. I confess that I have seldom
known a case which at first sight presented a more
singular problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our proceedings of that first morning did little
to advance the investigation. It was marked, how-
ever, at the outset by an incident which left the
most sinister impression upon my mind. The ap-
proach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is
down a narrow, winding, country lane. While we
made our way along it we heard the rattle of a car-
riage coming towards us and stood aside to let it
pass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through
the closed window of a horribly contorted, grin-
ning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and
gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vi-
sion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers!&#8221; cried Mortimer Tregennis,
white to his lips. &#8220;They are taking them to Hel-
ston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We looked with horror after the black carriage,
lumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps
towards this ill-omened house in which they had
met their strange fate.
</p>
<p>It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa
than a cottage, with a considerable garden which
was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with
spring flowers. Towards this garden the window
of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, accord-
ing to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that
thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a sin-
gle instant blasted their minds. Holmes walked
slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots
and along the path before we entered the porch. So
absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that
he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its con-
tents, and deluged both our feet and the garden
path. Inside the house we were met by the elderly
Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the
aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the
family. She readily answered all Holmes&#8217;s ques-
tions. She had heard nothing in the night. Her
employers had all been in excellent spirits lately,
and she had never known them more cheerful and
</p>
<p>prosperous. She had fainted with horror upon en-
tering the room in the morning and seeing that
dreadful company round the table. She had, when
she recovered, thrown open the window to let the
morning air in, and had run down to the lane,
whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor. The
lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see
her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into
the asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in
the house another day and was starting that very
afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.
</p>
<p>We ascended the stairs and viewed the body.
Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful
girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her
dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death,
but there still lingered upon it something of that
convulsion of horror which had been her last hu-
man emotion. From her bedroom we descended
to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy
had actually occurred. The charred ashes of the
overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table were
the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the
cards scattered over its surface. The chairs had
been moved back against the walls, but all else was
as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with
light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the var-
ious chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing
their positions. He tested how much of the garden
was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and
the fireplace; but never once did I see that sud-
den brightening of his eyes and tightening of his
lips which would have told me that he saw some
gleam of light in this utter darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why a fire?&#8221; he asked once. &#8220;Had they always
a fire in this small room on a spring evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night
was cold and damp. For that reason, after his ar-
rival, the fire was lit. &#8220;What are you going to do
now, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my
arm. &#8220;I think, Watson, that I shall resume that
course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so of-
ten and so justly condemned,&#8221; said he. &#8220;With your
permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our
cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is
likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the
facts over in my mid, Mr, Tregennis, and should
anything occur to me I will certainly ommunicate
with you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish
you both good-morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not until long after we were back in
Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete
and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his arm-
chair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible
</p>
<p>832</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black
brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his
eyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his
pipe and sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do, Watson!&#8221; said he with a laugh.
&#8220;Let us walk along the cliffs together and search
for flint arrows. We are more likely to find them
than clues to this problem. To let the brain work
without sufficient material is like racing an engine.
It racks itself to pieces. The sea air, sunshine, and
patience, Watson&#8212;all else will come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let us calmly define our position, Wat-
son,&#8221; he continued as we skirted the cliffs together.
&#8220;Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we
do know, so that when fresh facts arise we may
be ready to fit them into their places. I take it,
in the first place, that neither of us is prepared
to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of
men. Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of
our minds. Very good. There remain three per-
sons who have been grievously stricken by some
conscious or unconscious human agency. That is
firm ground. Now, when did this occur? Evi-
dently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was
immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left
the room. That is a very important point. The pre-
sumption is that it was within a few minutes after-
wards. The cards still lay upon the table. It was
already past their usual hour for bed. Yet they had
not changed their position or pushed back their
chairs. I repeat, then, that the occurrence was im-
mediately after his departure, and not later than
eleven o&#8217;clock last night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our next obvious step is to check, so far as
we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis af-
ter he left the room. In this there is no difficulty,
and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing
my methods as you do, you were, of course, con-
scious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedi-
ent by which I obtained a clearer impress of his
foot than might otherwise have been possible. The
wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was
also wet, you will remember, and it was not diffi-
cult&#8212;having obtained a sample print&#8212;to pick out
his track among others and to follow his move-
ments. He appears to have walked away swiftly in
the direction of the vicarage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared
from the scene, and yet some outside person af-
fected the card-players, how can we reconstruct
that person, and how was such an impression of
horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter may be eliminated.
She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence
that someone crept up to the garden window and
</p>
<p>in some manner produced so terrific an effect that
he drove those who saw it out of their senses? The
only suggestion in this direction comes from Mor-
timer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother
spoke about some movement in the garden. That
is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,
cloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to
alarm these people would be compelled to place
his very face against the glass before he could be
seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside
this window, but no indication of a footmark. It
is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could
have made so terrible an impression upon the com-
pany, nor have we found any possible motive for
so strange and elaborate an attempt. You perceive
our difficulties, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are only too clear,&#8221; I answered with con-
viction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, with a little more material, we may
prove that they are not insurmountable,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;I fancy that among your extensive
archives, Watson, you may find some which were
nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we shall put the
case aside until more accurate data are available,
and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit
of neolithic man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I may have commented upon my friend&#8217;s
power of mental detachment, but never have I
wondered at it more than upon that spring morn-
ing in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed
upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if
no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution.
It was not until we had returned in the afternoon
to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us,
who soon brought our minds back to the matter
in hand. Neither of us needed to be told who that
visitor was. The huge body, the craggy and deeply
seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like
nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our
cottage ceiling, the beard&#8212;golden at the fringes
and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain
from his perpetual cigar&#8212;all these were as well
known in London as in Africa, and could only be
associated with the tremendous personality of Dr.
Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.
</p>
<p>We had heard of his presence in the district and
had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure
upon the moorland paths. He made no advances
to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of do-
ing so to him, as it was well known that it was his
love of seclusion which caused him to spend the
greater part of the intervals between his journeys
in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of
Beauchamp Arriance. Here, amid his books and

</p>
<p>his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, at-
tending to his own simple wants and paying lit-
tle apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours.
It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him
asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had
made any advance in his reconstruction of this
mysterious episode. &#8220;The county police are ut-
terly at fault,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but perhaps your wider
experience has suggested some conceivable expla-
nation. My only claim to being taken into your
confidence is that during my many residences here
I have come to know this family of Tregennis very
well&#8212;indeed, upon my Cornish mother&#8217;s side I
could call them cousins&#8212;and their strange fate has
naturally been a great shock to me. I may tell you
that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to
Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and
I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes raised his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you lose your boat through it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take the next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! that is friendship indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you they were relatives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so&#8212;cousins of your mother. Was your
baggage aboard the ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. But surely this event could not have
found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I had a telegram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I ask from whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the ex-
plorer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruf-
fled composure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no objection to telling you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It was Mr. Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the
telegram which recalled me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I may say in
answer to your original question that I have not
cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this
case, but that I have every hope of reaching some
conclusion. It would be premature to say more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would not mind telling me if
your suspicions point in any particular direction?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can hardly answer that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have wasted my time and need not pro-
long my visit.&#8221; The famous doctor strode out of
our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within
</p>
<p>five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him
no more until the evening, when he returned with
a slow step and haggard face which assured me
that he had made no great progress with his inves-
tigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited
him and threw it into the grate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired
to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale&#8217;s account
was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last
night there, and that he has actually allowed some
of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he re-
turned to be present at this investigation. What
do you make of that, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is deeply interested.&#8221;
&#8220;Deeply interested&#8212;yes. There is a thread here
</p>
<p>which we had not yet grasped and which might
lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson, for
I am very sure that our material has not yet all
come to hand. When it does we may soon leave
our difficulties behind us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Little did I think how soon the words of
Holmes would be realized, or how strange and
sinister would be that new development which
opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation.
I was shaving at my window in the morning when
I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw
a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It
pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar,
sprang from it and rushed up our garden path.
Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened
down to meet him.
</p>
<p>Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly
articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic
story came out of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor
parish is devil-ridden!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Satan himself is
loose in it! We are given over into his hands!&#8221; He
danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object
if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes.
Finally he shot out his terrible news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the
night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the
rest of his family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an in-
stant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I can.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.
</p>
<p>Mr. Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal.
Hurry&#8212;hurry, before things get disarranged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage,
which were in an angle by themselves, the one
above the other. Below was a large sitting-room;
</p>
<p>834</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>above, his bedroom. They looked out upon a cro-
quet lawn which came up to the windows. We had
arrived before the doctor or the police, so that ev-
erything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me de-
scribe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that
misty March morning. It has left an impression
which can never be effaced from my mind.
</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the room was of a horri-
ble and depressing stuffiness. The servant who
had first entered had thrown up the window, or
it would have been even more intolerable. This
might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood
flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside
it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his
thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on
to his forehead, and his lean dark face turned to-
wards the window and twisted into the same dis-
tortion of terror which had marked the features of
his dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his
fingers contorted as though he had died in a very
paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though
there were signs that his dressing had been done in
a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had
been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to
him in the early morning.
</p>
<p>One realized the red-hot energy which under-
lay Holmes&#8217;s phlegmatic exterior when one saw
the sudden change which came over him from the
moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In
an instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining,
his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity.
He was out on the lawn, in through the window,
round the room, and up into the bedroom, for
all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a
cover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around
and ended by throwing open the window, which
appeared to give him some fresh cause for excite-
ment, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations
of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the
stair, out through the open window, threw him-
self upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and
into the room once more, all with the energy of
the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.
The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he
examined with minute care, making certain mea-
surements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinized
with his lens the talc shield which covered the top
of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which
adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them
into an envelope, which he placed in his pocket-
book. Finally, just as the doctor and the official
police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the
vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to say that my investigation has not
been entirely barren,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I cannot re-
</p>
<p>main to discuss the matter with the police, but I
should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if
you would give the inspector my compliments and
direct his attention to the bedroom window and
to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and
together they are almost conclusive. If the police
would desire further information I shall be happy
to see any of them at the cottage. And now, Wat-
son, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better em-
ployed elsewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It may be that the police resented the intrusion
of an amateur, or that they imagined themselves
to be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but
it is certain that we heard nothing from them for
the next two days. During this time Holmes spent
some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cot-
tage; but a greater portion in country walks which
he undertook alone, returning after many hours
without remark as to where he had been. One ex-
periment served to show me the line of his investi-
gation. He had bought a lamp which was the du-
plicate of the one which had burned in the room of
Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy.
This he filled with the same oil as that used at the
vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which
it would take to be exhausted. Another experiment
which he made was of a more unpleasant nature,
and one which I am not likely ever to forget.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will remember, Watson,&#8221; he remarked
one afternoon, &#8220;that there is a single common
point of resemblance in the varying reports which
have reached us. This concerns the effect of the
atmosphere of the room in each case upon those
who had first entered it. You will recollect that
Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of
his last visit to his brother&#8217;s house, remarked
that the doctor on entering the room fell into a
chair? You had forgotten? Well I can answer for
it that it was so. Now, you will remember also
that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she
herself fainted upon entering the room and had
afterwards opened the window. In the second
case&#8212;that of Mortimer Tregennis himself&#8212;you
cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the
room when we arrived, though the servant had
thrown open the window. That servant, I found
upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her
bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are
very suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a
poisonous atmosphere. In each case, also, there is
combustion going on in the room&#8212;in the one case
a fire, in the other a lamp. The fire was needed,
but the lamp was lit&#8212;as a comparison of the oil
consumed will show&#8212;long after it was broad day-
light. Why? Surely because there is some connec-
</p>
<p>835</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Devil&#8217;s Foot
</p>
<p>tion between three things&#8212;the burning, the stuffy
atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of
those unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would appear so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least we may accept it as a working hy-
pothesis. We will suppose, then, that something
was burned in each case which produced an at-
mosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good.
In the first instance&#8212;that of the Tregennis fam-
ily&#8212;this substance was placed in the fire. Now
the window was shut, but the fire would naturally
carry fumes to some extent up the chimney. Hence
one would expect the effects of the poison to be
less than in the second case, where there was less
escape for the vapour. The result seems to indi-
cate that it was so, since in the first case only the
woman, who had presumably the more sensitive
organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that
temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently
the first effect of the drug. In the second case the
result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to
bear out the theory of a poison which worked by
combustion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With this train of reasoning in my head I nat-
urally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis&#8217;s room
to find some remains of this substance. The ob-
vious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-
guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived
a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a
fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been
consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I
placed it in an envelope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why half, Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in
the way of the official police force. I leave them
all the evidence which I found. The poison still
remained upon the talc had they the wit to find
it. Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will,
however, take the precaution to open our window
to avoid the premature decease of two deserving
members of society, and you will seat yourself near
that open window in an armchair unless, like a
sensible man, you determine to have nothing to
do with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will
you? I thought I knew my Watson. This chair I
will place opposite yours, so that we may be the
same distance from the poison and face to face.
The door we will leave ajar. Each is now in a posi-
tion to watch the other and to bring the experiment
to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is
that all clear? Well, then, I take our powder&#8212;or
what remains of it&#8212;from the envelope, and I lay it
above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us
sit down and await developments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were not long in coming. I had hardly set-
tled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick,
musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very
first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were
beyond all control. A thick, black cloud swirled
before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this
cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon
my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely
horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably
wicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and
swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace
and a warning of something coming, the advent
of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold,
whose very shadow would blast my soul. A freez-
ing horror took possession of me. I felt that my
hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding,
that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like
leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that
something must surely snap. I tried to scream and
was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which
was my own voice, but distant and detached from
myself. At the same moment, in some effort of
escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and
had a glimpse of Holmes&#8217;s face, white, rigid, and
drawn with horror&#8212;the very look which I had
seen upon the features of the dead. It was that
vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of
strength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms
round Holmes, and together we lurched through
the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown
ourselves down upon the grass plot and were ly-
ing side by side, conscious only of the glorious
sunshine which was bursting its way through the
hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. Slowly
it rose from our souls like the mists from a land-
scape until peace and reason had returned, and we
were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy
foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each
other to mark the last traces of that terrific experi-
ence which we had undergone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word, Watson!&#8221; said Holmes at
last with an unsteady voice, &#8220;I owe you both my
thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable ex-
periment even for one&#8217;s self, and doubly so for a
friend. I am really very sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; I answered with some emotion,
for I have never seen so much of Holmes&#8217;s heart
before, &#8220;that it is my greatest joy and privilege to
help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He relapsed at once into the half-humorous,
half-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude
to those about him. &#8220;It would be superfluous to
drive us mad, my dear Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A can-
did observer would certainly declare that we were
so already before we embarked upon so wild an
</p>
<p>836</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>experiment. I confess that I never imagined that
the effect could be so sudden and so severe.&#8221; He
dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the
burning lamp held at full arm&#8217;s length, he threw
it among a bank of brambles. &#8220;We must give the
room a little time to clear. I take it, Watson, that
you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how
these tragedies were produced?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the cause remains as obscure as before.
Come into the arbour here and let us discuss it to-
gether. That villainous stuff seems still to linger
round my throat. I think we must admit that all
the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregen-
nis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy,
though he was the victim in the second one. We
must remember, in the first place, that there is
some story of a family quarrel, followed by a rec-
onciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have been,
or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.
When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy
face and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the
spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge
to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well,
in the next place, you will remember that this idea
of someone moving in the garden, which took our
attention for a moment from the real cause of the
tragedy, emanated from him. He had a motive in
misleading us. Finally, if he did not throw the sub-
stance into the fire at the moment of leaving the
room, who did do so? The affair happened imme-
diately after his departure. Had anyone else come
in, the family would certainly have risen from the
table. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did
not arrive after ten o&#8217;clock at night. We may take
it, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer
Tregennis as the culprit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then his own death was suicide!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not im-
possible supposition. The man who had the guilt
upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon
his own family might well be driven by remorse to
inflict it upon himself. There are, however, some
cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one
man in England who knows all about it, and I have
made arrangements by which we shall hear the
facts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is
a little before his time. Perhaps you would kindly
step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been
conducing a chemical experiment indoors which
has left our little room hardly fit for the reception
of so distinguished a visitor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had heard the click of the garden gate, and
now the majestic figure of the great African ex-
plorer appeared upon the path. He turned in some
surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note
about an hour ago, and I have come, though I re-
ally do not know why I should obey your sum-
mons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can clear the point up before we
separate,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Meanwhile, I am much
obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.
You will excuse this informal reception in the open
air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly fur-
nished an additional chapter to what the papers
call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear at-
mosphere for the present. Perhaps, since the mat-
ters which we have to discuss will affect you per-
sonally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that
we should talk where there can be no eavesdrop-
ping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The explorer took his cigar from his lips and
gazed sternly at my companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at a loss to know, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what you
can have to speak about which affects me person-
ally in a very intimate fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>For a moment I wished that I were armed.
Sterndale&#8217;s fierce face turned to a dusky red, his
eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins
started out in his forehead, while he sprang for-
ward with clenched hands towards my compan-
ion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort
he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was,
perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-
headed outburst.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have lived so long among savages and be-
yond the law,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I have got into the
way of being a law to myself. You would do well,
Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to
do you an injury.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr.
Sterndale. Surely the clearest proof of it is that,
knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not
for the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for,
perhaps, the first time in his adventurous life.
There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes&#8217;s
manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor
stammered for a moment, his great hands opening
and shutting in his agitation.
</p>
<p>837</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Devil&#8217;s Foot
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked at last. &#8220;If this
is bluff upon your part, Mr. Holmes, you have cho-
sen a bad man for your experiment. Let us have no
more beating about the bush. What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;and the reason
why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget
frankness. What my next step may be will depend
entirely upon the nature of your own defence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My defence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My defence against what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tre-
gennis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sterndale mopped his forehead with his hand-
kerchief. &#8220;Upon my word, you are getting on,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Do all your successes depend upon this
prodigious power of bluff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The bluff,&#8221; said Holmes sternly, &#8220;is upon your
side, Dr. Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine. As a
proof I will tell you some of the facts upon which
my conclusions are based. Of your return from
Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go
on to Africa, I will say nothing save that it first in-
formed me that you were one of the factors which
had to be taken into account in reconstructing this
drama&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard your reasons and regard them as
unconvincing and inadequate. We will pass that.
You came down here to ask me whom I suspected.
I refused to answer you. You then went to the
vicarage, waited outside it for some time, and fi-
nally returned to your cottage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw no one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what you may expect to see when I
follow you. You spent a restless night at your cot-
tage, and you formed certain plans, which in the
early morning you proceeded to put into execu-
tion. Leaving your door just as day was breaking,
you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel
that was lying heaped beside your gate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at
Holmes in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You then walked swiftly for the mile which
separated you from the vicarage. You were wear-
ing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis
shoes which are at the present moment upon your
feet. At the vicarage you passed through the or-
chard and the side hedge, coming out under the
</p>
<p>window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now day-
light, but the household was not yet stirring. You
drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and
you threw it up at the window above you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sterndale sprang to his feet.
&#8220;I believe that you are the devil himself!&#8221; he
</p>
<p>cried.
Holmes smiled at the compliment. &#8220;It took
</p>
<p>two, or possibly three, handfuls before the lodger
came to the window. You beckoned him to come
down. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his
sitting-room. You entered by the window. There
was an interview&#8212;a short one&#8212;during which you
walked up and down the room. Then you passed
out and closed the window, standing on the lawn
outside smoking a cigar and watching what oc-
curred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you
withdrew as you had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale,
how do you justify such conduct, and what were
the motives for your actions? If you prevaricate or
trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the
matter will pass out of my hands forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor&#8217;s face had turned ashen gray as he
listened to the words of his accuser. Now he sat
for some time in thought with his face sunk in his
hands. Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he
plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and
threw it on the rustic table before us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why I have done it,&#8221; said he.
It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful
</p>
<p>woman. Holmes stooped over it.
&#8220;Brenda Tregennis,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Yes, Brenda Tregennis,&#8221; repeated our visitor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For years I have loved her. For years she has loved
me. There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion
which people have marvelled at. It has brought
me close to the one thing on earth that was dear
to me. I could not marry her, for I have a wife
who has left me for years and yet whom, by the
deplorable laws of England, I could not divorce.
For years Brenda waited. For years I waited. And
this is what we have waited for.&#8221; A terrible sob
shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat
under his brindled beard. Then with an effort he
mastered himself and spoke on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The vicar knew. He was in our confidence.
He would tell you that she was an angel upon
earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and
I returned. What was my baggage or Africa to me
when I learned that such a fate had come upon
my darling? There you have the missing clue to
my action, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Proceed,&#8221; said my friend.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper
packet and laid it upon the table. On the outside
was written &#8220;Radix pedis diaboli&#8221; with a red poi-
son label beneath it. He pushed it towards me. &#8220;I
understand that you are a doctor, sir. Have you
ever heard of this preparation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil&#8217;s-foot root! No, I have never heard of
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no reflection upon your professional
knowledge,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for I believe that, save for
one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no
other specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its
way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the liter-
ature of toxicology. The root is shaped like a foot,
half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name
given by a botanical missionary. It is used as an
ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain dis-
tricts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among
them. This particular specimen I obtained under
very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi
country.&#8221; He opened the paper as he spoke and
disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like pow-
der.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir?&#8221; asked Holmes sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that
actually occurred, for you already know so much
that it is clearly to my interest that you should
know all. I have already explained the relationship
in which I stood to the Tregennis family. For the
sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers.
There was a family quarrel about money which es-
tranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to
be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the
others. He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and
several things arose which gave me a suspicion of
him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came
down to my cottage and I showed him some of
my African curiosities. Among other things I ex-
hibited this powder, and I told him of its strange
properties, how it stimulates those brain centres
which control the emotion of fear, and how either
madness or death is the fate of the unhappy na-
tive who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest
of his tribe. I told him also how powerless Euro-
pean science would be to detect it. How he took
it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there
is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening
cabinets and stooping to box
