<p>rs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock
Holmes, was a long-suffering woman.
Not only was her first-floor flat invaded
at all hours by throngs of singular and
</p>
<p>often undesirable characters but her remarkable
lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in
his life which must have sorely tried her patience.
His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music
at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice
within doors, his weird and often malodorous sci-
entific experiments, and the atmosphere of vio-
lence and danger which hung around him made
him the very worst tenant in London. On the other
hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt
that the house might have been purchased at the
price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the
years that I was with him.
</p>
<p>The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him
and never dared to interfere with him, however
outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was
fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentle-
ness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He
disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always
a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was
her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story
when she came to my rooms in the second year of
my married life and told me of the sad condition
to which my poor friend was reduced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dying, Dr. Watson,&#8221; said she. &#8220;For three
days he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will
last the day. He would not let me get a doctor.
This morning when I saw his bones sticking out
of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me
I could stand no more of it. &#8216;With your leave or
without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor
this very hour,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Let it be Watson, then,&#8217; said
he. I wouldn&#8217;t waste an hour in coming to him, sir,
or you may not see him alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his
illness. I need not say that I rushed for my coat
and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the de-
tails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been
working at a case down at Rotherhithe, in an alley
near the river, and he has brought this illness back
with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday after-
noon and has never moved since. For these three
days neither food nor drink has passed his lips.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t have it, sir. You know how mas-
terful he is. I didn&#8217;t dare to disobey him. But he&#8217;s
not long for this world, as you&#8217;ll see for yourself
the moment that you set eyes on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the
dim light of a foggy November day the sick room
was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted
face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill
to my heart. His eyes had the brightness of fever,
there was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and
dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon
the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was
croaking and spasmodic. He lay listlessly as I
entered the room, but the sight of me brought a
gleam of recognition to his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon
evil days,&#8221; said he in a feeble voice, but with some-
thing of his old carelessness of manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow!&#8221; I cried, approaching him.
&#8220;Stand back! Stand right back!&#8221; said he with
</p>
<p>the sharp imperiousness which I had associated
only with moments of crisis. &#8220;If you approach me,
Watson, I shall order you out of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;
&#8220;Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?&#8221;
Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more mas-
</p>
<p>terful than ever. It was pitiful, however, to see his
exhaustion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wished to help,&#8221; I explained.
&#8220;Exactly! You will help best by doing what you
</p>
<p>are told.&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly, Holmes.&#8221;
He relaxed the austerity of his manner.
&#8220;You are not angry?&#8221; he asked, gasping for
</p>
<p>breath.
Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw
</p>
<p>him lying in such a plight before me?
&#8220;It&#8217;s for your own sake, Watson,&#8221; he croaked.
&#8220;For my sake?&#8221;
&#8220;I know what is the matter with me. It is
</p>
<p>a coolie disease from Sumatra&#8212;a thing that the
Dutch know more about than we, though they
have made little of it up to date. One thing only
is certain. It is infallibly deadly, and it is horribly
contagious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long
hands twitching and jerking as he motioned me
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Contagious by touch, Watson&#8212;that&#8217;s it, by
touch. Keep your distance and all is well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that
such a consideration weighs with me of an instant?
It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. Do
you imagine it would prevent me from doing my
duty to so old a friend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>807</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dying Detective
</p>
<p>Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a
look of furious anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will stand there I will talk. If you do
not you must leave the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I have so deep a respect for the extraordi-
nary qualities of Holmes that I have always de-
ferred to his wishes, even when I least understood
them. But now all my professional instincts were
aroused. Let him be my master elsewhere, I at
least was his in a sick room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you are not yourself. A sick
man is but a child, and so I will treat you. Whether
you like it or not, I will examine your symptoms
and treat you for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at me with venomous eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not,
let me at least have someone in whom I have con-
fidence,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have none in me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In your friendship, certainly. But facts are
facts, Watson, and, after all, you are only a gen-
eral practitioner with very limited experience and
mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say
these things, but you leave me no choice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was bitterly hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes.
It shows me very clearly the state of your own
nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I
would not intrude my services. Let me bring Sir
Jasper Meek or Penrose Fisher, or any of the best
men in London. But someone you must have, and
that is final. If you think that I am going to stand
here and see you die without either helping you
myself or bringing anyone else to help you, then
you have mistaken your man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean well, Watson,&#8221; said the sick man
with something between a sob and a groan. &#8220;Shall
I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you
know, pray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know
of the black Formosa corruption?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never heard of either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many problems of disease, many
strange pathological possibilities, in the East, Wat-
son.&#8221; He paused after each sentence to collect his
failing strength. &#8220;I have learned so much dur-
ing some recent researches which have a medico-
criminal aspect. It was in the course of them that I
contracted this complaint. You can do nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr.
Ainstree, the greatest living authority upon trop-
ical disease, is now in London. All remonstrance
</p>
<p>is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch
him.&#8221; I turned resolutely to the door.
</p>
<p>Never have I had such a shock! In an instant,
with a tiger-spring, the dying man had intercepted
me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. The
next moment he had staggered back to his bed,
exhausted and panting after his one tremendous
outflame of energy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t take the key from be by force, Wat-
son, I&#8217;ve got you, my friend. Here you are, and
here you will stay until I will otherwise. But I&#8217;ll
humour you.&#8221; (All this in little gasps, with terrible
struggles for breath between.) &#8220;You&#8217;ve only my
own good at heart. Of course I know that very
well. You shall have your way, but give me time to
get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It&#8217;s
four o&#8217;clock. At six you can go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is insanity, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will
</p>
<p>go at six. Are you content to wait?&#8221;
&#8220;I seem to have no choice.&#8221;
&#8220;None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need
</p>
<p>no help in arranging the clothes. You will please
keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one
other condition that I would make. You will seek
help, not from the man you mention, but from the
one that I choose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221;
&#8220;The first three sensible words that you have
</p>
<p>uttered since you entered this room, Watson. You
will find some books over there. I am somewhat
exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it
pours electricity into a non-conductor? At six,
Watson, we resume our conversation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was destined to be resumed long before
that hour, and in circumstances which gave me a
shock hardly second to that caused by his spring
to the door. I had stood for some minutes look-
ing at the silent figure in the bed. His face was
almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to
be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to read-
ing, I walked slowly round the room, examining
the pictures of celebrated criminals with which
every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless
perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A lit-
ter of pipes, tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives,
revolver-cartridges, and other debris was scattered
over it. In the midst of these was a small black
and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a
neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand
to examine it more closely when&#8212;
</p>
<p>It was a dreadful cry that he gave&#8212;a yell which
might have been heard down the street. My skin
went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible
</p>
<p>808</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a con-
vulsed face and frantic eyes. I stood paralyzed,
with the little box in my hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson&#8212;this
instant, I say!&#8221; His head sank back upon the pil-
low and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I replaced
the box upon the mantelpiece. &#8220;I hate to have
my things touched, Watson. You know that I hate
it. You fidget me beyond endurance. You, a doc-
tor&#8212;you are enough to drive a patient into an asy-
lum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The incident left a most unpleasant impression
upon my mind. The violent and causeless excite-
ment, followed by this brutality of speech, so far
removed from his usual suavity, showed me how
deep was the disorganization of his mind. Of all
ruins, that of a noble mind is the most deplorable.
I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time
had passed. He seemed to have been watching the
clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he
began to talk with the same feverish animation as
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Have you any
change in your pocket?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any silver?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many half-crowns?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have five.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate,
Watson! However, such as they are you can put
them in your watchpocket. And all the rest of your
money in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It
will balance you so much better like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was raving insanity. He shuddered, and
again made a sound between a cough and a sob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will now light the gas, Watson, but you
will be very careful that not for one instant shall
it be more than half on. I implore you to be care-
ful, Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you
need not draw the blind. Now you will have the
kindness to place some letters and papers upon
this table within my reach. Thank you. Now some
of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Wat-
son! There is a sugar-tongs there. Kindly raise
that small ivory box with its assistance. Place it
here among the papers. Good! You can now go
and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke
Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had
somewhat weakened, for poor Holmes was so ob-
viously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave
</p>
<p>him. However, he was as eager now to consult the
person named as he had been obstinate in refus-
ing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard the name,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly not, my good Watson. It may sur-
prise you to know that the man upon earth who
is best versed in this disease is not a medical man,
but a planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known
resident of Sumatra, now visiting London. An out-
break of the disease upon his plantation, which
was distant from medical aid, caused him to study
it himself, with some rather far-reaching conse-
quences. He is a very methodical person, and I
did not desire you to start before six, because I
was well aware that you would not find him in his
study. If you could persuade him to come here
and give us the benefit of his unique experience
of this disease, the investigation of which has been
his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could
help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I gave Holmes&#8217;s remarks as a consecutive
whole and will not attempt to indicate how they
were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those
clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain
from which he was suffering. His appearance had
changed for the worse during the few hours that I
had been with him. Those hectic spots were more
pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of
darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon
his brow. He still retained, however, the jaunty
gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would
always be the master.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will tell him exactly how you have left
me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You will convey the very impres-
sion which is in your own mind&#8212;a dying man&#8212;a
dying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think
why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid
mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem. Ah,
I am wondering! Strange how the brain controls
the brain! What was I saying, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it.
Plead with him, Watson. There is no good feeling
between us. His nephew, Watson&#8212;I had suspi-
cions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The
boy died horribly. He has a grudge against me.
You will soften him, Watson. Beg him, pray him,
get him here by any means. He can save me&#8212;only
he!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him
down to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the sort. You will per-
suade him to come. And then you will return in
</p>
<p>809</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dying Detective
</p>
<p>front of him. Make any excuse so as not to come
with him. Don&#8217;t forget, Watson. You won&#8217;t fail me.
You never did fail me. No doubt there are natural
enemies which limit the increase of the creatures.
You and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall
the world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no;
horrible! You&#8217;ll convey all that is in your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I left him full of the image of this magnifi-
cent intellect babbling like a foolish child. He had
handed me the key, and with a happy thought I
took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs.
Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in
the passage. Behind me as I passed from the flat I
heard Holmes&#8217;s high, thin voice in some delirious
chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man
came on me through the fog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Mr. Holmes, sir?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton,
of Scotland Yard, dressed in unofficial tweeds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very ill,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>He looked at me in a most singular fashion.
Had it not been too fiendish, I could have imag-
ined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exulta-
tion in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some rumour of it,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>The cab had driven up, and I left him.
</p>
<p>Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine
houses lying in the vague borderland between
Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular one
at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug
and demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron
railings, its massive folding-door, and its shining
brasswork. All was in keeping with a solemn but-
ler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a
tinted electrical light behind him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson!
Very good, sir, I will take up your card.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My humble name and title did not appear to
impress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through the half-
open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this person? What does he want? Dear
me, Staples, how often have I said that I am not to
be disturbed in my hours of study?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There came a gentle flow of soothing explana-
tion from the butler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t see him, Staples. I can&#8217;t have my
work interrupted like this. I am not at home. Say
so. Tell him to come in the morning if he really
must see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the gentle murmur.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, give him that message. He can
come in the morning, or he can stay away. My
work must not be hindered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of
sickness and counting the minutes, perhaps, un-
til I could bring help to him. It was not a time
to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon
my promptness. Before the apologetic butler had
delivered his message I had pushed past him and
was in the room.
</p>
<p>With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a
reclining chair beside the fire. I saw a great yel-
low face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy,
double-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes
which glared at me from under tufted and sandy
brows. A high bald head had a small velvet
smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of
its pink curve. The skull was of enormous capac-
ity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amaze-
ment that the figure of the man was small and frail,
twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has
suffered from rickets in his childhood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he cried in a high, screaming
voice. &#8220;What is the meaning of this intrusion?
Didn&#8217;t I send you word that I would see you to-
morrow morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but the matter cannot be
delayed. Mr. Sherlock Holmes&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mention of my friend&#8217;s name had an ex-
traordinary effect upon the little man. The look
of anger passed in an instant from his face. His
features became tense and alert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come from Holmes?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I have just left him.&#8221;
&#8220;What about Holmes? How is he?&#8221;
&#8220;He is desperately ill. That is why I have
</p>
<p>come.&#8221;
The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to
</p>
<p>resume his own. As he did so I caught a glimpse
of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I
could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and
abominable smile. Yet I persuaded myself that it
must have been some nervous contraction which I
had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later
with genuine concern upon his features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear this,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I only
know Mr. Holmes through some business dealings
which we have had, but I have every respect for
his talents and his character. He is an amateur of
crime, as I am of disease. For him the villain, for
me the microbe. There are my prisons,&#8221; he con-
tinued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which
stood upon a side table. &#8221;Among those gelatine
</p>
<p>810</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>cultivations some of the very worst offenders in
the world are now doing time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on account of your special knowledge
that Mr. Holmes desired to see you. He has a high
opinion of you and thought that you were the one
man in London who could help him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-
cap slid to the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why should Mr. Homes
think that I could help him in his trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of your knowledge of Eastern dis-
eases.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should he think that this disease
which he has contracted is Eastern?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, in some professional inquiry, he has
been working among Chinese sailors down in the
docks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and
picked up his smoking-cap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it&#8212;is it?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I trust the mat-
ter is not so grave as you suppose. How long has
he been ill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About three days.&#8221;
&#8220;Is he delirious?&#8221;
&#8220;Occasionally.&#8221;
&#8220;Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be in-
</p>
<p>human not to answer his call. I very much resent
any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this
case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I remembered Holmes&#8217;s injunction.
&#8220;I have another appointment,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes&#8217;s address. You can rely upon my be-
ing there within half an hour at most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was with a sinking heart that I reentered
Holmes&#8217;s bedroom. For all that I knew the worst
might have happened in my absence. To my enor-
mous relief, he had improved greatly in the inter-
val. His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all
trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a
feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his
usual crispness and lucidity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you see him, Watson?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; he is coming.&#8221;
&#8220;Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the
</p>
<p>best of messengers.&#8221;
&#8220;He wished to return with me.&#8221;
&#8220;That would never do, Watson. That would be
</p>
<p>obviously impossible. Did he ask what ailed me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him about the Chinese in the East End.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that
</p>
<p>a good friend could. You can now disappear from
the scene.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Of course you must. But I have reasons to
</p>
<p>suppose that this opinion would be very much
more frank and valuable if he imagines that we
are alone. There is just room behind the head of
my bed, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes!&#8221;
&#8220;I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The
</p>
<p>room does not lend itself to concealment, which
is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspi-
cion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could
be done.&#8221; Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intent-
ness upon his haggard face. &#8220;There are the wheels,
Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don&#8217;t
budge, whatever happens&#8212;whatever happens, do
you hear? Don&#8217;t speak! Don&#8217;t move! Just listen
with all your ears.&#8221; Then in an instant his sud-
den access of strength departed, and his masterful,
purposeful talk droned away into the low, vague
murmurings of a semi-delirious man.
</p>
<p>From the hiding-place into which I had been
so swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the
stair, with the opening and the closing of the bed-
room door. Then, to my surprise, there came a
long silence, broken only by the heavy breathings
and gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that
our visitor was standing by the bedside and look-
ing down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush
was broken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Holmes!&#8221; in the insistent
tone of one who awakens a sleeper. &#8221;Can&#8217;t you
hear me, Holmes?&#8221; There was a rustling, as if he
had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Mr. Smith?&#8221; Holmes whispered.
&#8220;I hardly dared hope that you would come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other laughed.
&#8220;I should imagine not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And yet, you
</p>
<p>see, I am here. Coals of fire, Holmes&#8212;coals of
fire!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very good of you&#8212;very noble of you. I
appreciate your special knowledge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor sniggered.
&#8220;You do. You are, fortunately, the only man
</p>
<p>in London who does. Do you know what is the
matter with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Ah! You recognize the symptoms?&#8221;
&#8220;Only too well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>811</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Dying Detective
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, Holmes. I
shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it were the same. A bad
lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead man
on the fourth day&#8212;a strong, hearty young fellow.
It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that
he should have contracted and out-of-the-way Asi-
atic disease in the heart of London&#8212;a disease, too,
of which I had made such a very special study.
Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very smart of you
to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that
it was cause and effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that you did it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn&#8217;t
prove it, anyhow. But what do you think of your-
self spreading reports about me like that, and then
crawling to me for help the moment you are in
trouble? What sort of a game is that&#8212;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the
sick man. &#8220;Give me the water!&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re precious near your end, my friend, but
I don&#8217;t want you to go till I have had a word with
you. That&#8217;s why I give you water. There, don&#8217;t
slop it about! That&#8217;s right. Can you understand
what I say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes groaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what you can for me. Let bygones be by-
gones,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put the words out of
my head&#8212;I swear I will. Only cure me, and I&#8217;ll
forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, about Victor Savage&#8217;s death. You as
good as admitted just now that you had done it.
I&#8217;ll forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can forget it or remember it, just as you
like. I don&#8217;t see you in the witnessbox. Quite an-
other shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you.
It matters nothing to me that you should know
how my nephew died. It&#8217;s not him we are talk-
ing about. It&#8217;s you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow who came for me&#8212;I&#8217;ve forgotten
his name&#8212;said that you contracted it down in the
East End among the sailors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could only account for it so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you
not? Think yourself smart, don&#8217;t you? You came
across someone who was smarter this time. Now
cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no
other way you could have got this thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think. My mind is gone. For heaven&#8217;s
sake help me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will help you. I&#8217;ll help you to under-
stand just where you are and how you got there.
I&#8217;d like you to know before you die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me something to ease my pain.&#8221;
&#8220;Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some
</p>
<p>squealing towards the end. Takes you as cramp, I
fancy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; it is cramp.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen
</p>
<p>now! Can you remember any unusual incident in
your life just about the time your symptoms be-
gan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;Think again.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m too ill to think.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll help you. Did anything come
</p>
<p>by post?&#8221;
&#8220;By post?&#8221;
&#8220;A box by chance?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m fainting&#8212;I&#8217;m gone!&#8221;
&#8220;Listen, Holmes!&#8221; There was a sound as if he
</p>
<p>was shaking the dying man, and it was all that I
could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place.
&#8220;You must hear me. You shall hear me. Do you re-
member a box&#8212;an ivory box? It came on Wednes-
day. You opened it&#8212;do you remember?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring
inside it. Some joke&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no joke, as you will find to your cost.
You fool, you would have it and you have got it.
Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left
me alone I would not have hurt you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; Holmes gasped. &#8220;The spring! It
drew blood. This box&#8212;this on the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The very one, by George! And it may as well
leave the room in my pocket. There goes your last
shred of evidence. But you have the truth now,
Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that
I killed you. You knew too much of the fate of Vic-
tor Savage, so I have sent you to share it. You are
very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I
will watch you die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s voice had sunk to an almost inaudi-
ble whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;Turn up the gas?
Ah, the shadows begin to fall, do they? Yes, I
will turn it up, that I may see you the better.&#8221; He
crossed the room and the light suddenly bright-
ened. &#8221;Is there any other little service that I can do
you, my friend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A match and a cigarette.&#8221;
</p>
<p>812</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>I nearly called out in my joy and my amaze-
ment. He was speaking in his natural voice&#8212;a lit-
tle weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There
was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith
was standing in silent amazement looking down
at his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221; I heard him say
at last in a dry, rasping tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way of successfully acting a part is to
be it,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I give you my word that for
three days I have tasted neither food nor drink un-
til you were good enough to pour me out that glass
of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most
irksome. Ah, here are some cigarettes.&#8221; I heard
the striking of a match. &#8221;That is very much bett
