</p>
<p>yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your
theories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the message?&#8221;
&#8220;How did it run? &#8216;Our own colours, green and
</p>
<p>white.&#8217; Sounds like racing. &#8216;Green open, white
shut.&#8217; That is clearly a signal. &#8216;Main stair, first cor-
ridor, seventh right, green baize.&#8217; This is an assig-
nation. We may find a jealous husband at the bot-
tom of it all. It was clearly a dangerous quest. She
would not have said &#8216;Godspeed&#8217; had it not been
so. &#8216;D&#8217;&#8212;that should be a guide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that &#8216;D&#8217;
stands for Dolores, a common female name in
Spain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, Watson, very good&#8212;but quite inad-
missable. A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard
in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly En-
glish. Well, we can only possess our soul in pa-
tience until this excellent inspector come back for
us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which
has rescued us for a few short hours from the in-
sufferable fatigues of idleness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An answer had arrived to Holmes&#8217;s telegram
before our Surrey officer had returned. Holmes
read it and was about to place it in his notebook
when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face.
He tossed it across with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are moving in exalted circles,&#8221; said he.
The telegram was a list of names and ad-
</p>
<p>dresses:
</p>
<p>Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George
Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes
Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James
Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr.
Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua
Stone, Nether Walsling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very obvious way of limiting our field
of operations,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;No doubt Baynes,
with his methodical mind, has already adopted
some similar plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived
at the conclusion that the massage received by Gar-
cia at dinner was an appointment or an assigna-
tion. Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct,
and in order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a
main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor,
it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large
one. It is equally certain that this house cannot
be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since
Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped,
according to my reading of the facts, to be back in
Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi,
which would only be valid up to one o&#8217;clock. As
the number of large houses close to Oxshott must
be limited, I adopted the obvious method of send-
ing to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and
obtaining a list of them. Here they are in this tele-
gram, and the other end of our tangled skein must
lie among them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nearly six o&#8217;clock before we found our-
selves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with
Inspector Baynes as our companion.
</p>
<p>Holmes and I had taken things for the night,
and found comfortable quarters at the Bull. Finally
we set out in the company of the detective on our
visit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March
evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating
upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common
over which our road passed and the tragic goal to
which it led us.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
The Tiger of San Pedro
</p>
<p>A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of
miles brought us to a high wooden gate, which
opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The
curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark
house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky.
From the front window upon the left of the door
</p>
<p>there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a constable in possession,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>Baynes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll knock at the window.&#8221; He stepped
across the grass plot and tapped with his hand
on the pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly
saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire,
</p>
<p>754</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tiger of San Pedro
</p>
<p>and heard a sharp cry from within the room. An
instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing police-
man had opened the door, the candle wavering in
his trembling hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Walters?&#8221; asked Baynes
sharply.
</p>
<p>The man mopped his forehead with his hand-
kerchief and agave a long sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you have come, sir. It has been
a long evening, and I don&#8217;t think my nerve is as
good as it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your nerve, Walters? I should not have
thought you had a nerve in your body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, it&#8217;s this lonely, silent house and the
queer thing in the kitchen. Then when you tapped
at the window I thought it had come again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That what had come again?&#8221;
&#8220;The devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the win-
</p>
<p>dow.&#8221;
&#8220;What was at the window, and when?&#8221;
&#8220;It was just about two hours ago. The light
</p>
<p>was just fading. I was sitting reading in the chair.
I don&#8217;t know what made me look up, but there
was a face looking in at me through the lower
pane. Lord, sir, what a face it was! I&#8217;ll see it in
my dreams.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-
constable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and
there&#8217;s no use to deny it. It wasn&#8217;t black, sir, nor
was it white, nor any colour that I know but a
kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk
in it. Then there was the size of it&#8212;it was twice
yours, sir. And the look of it&#8212;the great staring
goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hun-
gry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn&#8217;t move a finger,
nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was
gone. Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but
thank God there was no one there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t know you were a good man, Wal-
ters, I should put a black mark against you for this.
If it were the devil himself a constable on duty
should never thank God that he could not lay his
hands upon him. I suppose the whole thing is not
a vision and a touch of nerves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, at least, is very easily settled,&#8221; said
Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
he reported, after a short examination of the grass
bed, &#8220;a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he was
all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly
have been a giant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to have broken through the shrub-
bery and made for the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the inspector with a grave and
thoughtful face, &#8220;whoever he may have been, and
whatever he may have wanted, he&#8217;s gone for the
present, and we have more immediate things to at-
tend to. Now, Mr. Holmes, with your permission,
I will show you round the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had
yielded nothing to a careful search. Apparently
the tenants had brought little or nothing with
them, and all the furniture down to the smallest
details had been taken over with the house. A
good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and
Co., High Holborn, had been left behind. Tele-
graphic inquiries had been already made which
showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer
save that he was a good payer. Odds and ends,
some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Span-
ish, and old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a gui-
tar were among the personal property.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in all this,&#8221; said Baynes, stalking,
candle in hand, from room to room. &#8220;But now, Mr.
Holmes, I invite your attention to the kitchen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the
back of the house, with a straw litter in one corner,
which served apparently as a bed for the cook. The
table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty
plates, the debris of last night&#8217;s dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this,&#8221; said Baynes. &#8220;What do you
make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held up his candle before an extraordinary
object which stood at the back of the dresser. It
was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that
it was difficult to say what it might have been. One
could but say that it was black and leathery and
that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish, hu-
man figure. At first, as I examined it, I thought
that it was a mummified negro baby, and then it
seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey. Fi-
nally I was left in doubt as to whether it was ani-
mal or human. A double band of white shells were
strung round the centre of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very interesting&#8212;very interesting, indeed!&#8221;
said Holmes, peering at this sinister relic. &#8220;Any-
thing more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and
held forward his candle. The limbs and body of
some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces
with the feathers still on, were littered all over it.
Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A white cock,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Most interesting! It
is really a very curious case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>755</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
</p>
<p>But Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister ex-
hibit to the last. From under the sink he drew
a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood.
Then from the table he took a platter heaped with
small pieces of charred bone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has been killed and something has
been burned. We raked all these out of the fire. We
had a doctor in this morning. He says that they are
not human.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands.
&#8220;I must congratulate you, Inspector, on han-
</p>
<p>dling so distinctive and instructive a case. Your
powers, if I may say so without offence, seem su-
perior to your opportunities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inspector Baynes&#8217;s small eyes twinkled with
pleasure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the
provinces. A case of this sort gives a man a chance,
and I hope that I shall take it. What do you make
of these bones?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A lamb, I should say, or a kid.&#8221;
&#8220;And the white cock?&#8221;
&#8220;Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious. I should
</p>
<p>say almost unique.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, there must have been some very
</p>
<p>strange people with some very strange ways in this
house. One of them is dead. Did his companions
follow him and kill him? If they did we should
have them, for every port is watched. But my own
views are different. Yes, sir, my own views are
very different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a theory then?&#8221;
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll work it myself, Mr. Holmes. It&#8217;s only
</p>
<p>due to my own credit to do so. Your name is made,
but I have still to make mine. I should be glad to be
able to say afterwards that I had solved it without
your help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laughed good-humoredly.
&#8220;Well, well, Inspector,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do you fol-
</p>
<p>low your path and I will follow mine. My results
are always very much at your service if you care
to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen
all that I wish in this house, and that my time may
be more profitably employed elsewhere. Au revoir
and good luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which
might have been lost upon anyone but myself, that
Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive as ever
to the casual observer, there were none the less a
subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in
his brightened eyes and brisker manner which as-
sured me that the game was afoot. After his habit
</p>
<p>he said nothing, and after mine I asked no ques-
tions. Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend
my humble help to the capture without distracting
that intent brain with needless interruption. All
would come round to me in due time.
</p>
<p>I waited, therefore&#8212;but to my ever-deepening
disappointment I waited in vain. Day succeeded
day, and my friend took no step forward. One
morning he spent in town, and I learned from a
casual reference that he had visited the British Mu-
seum. Save for this one excursion, he spent his
days in long and often solitary walks, or in chat-
ting with a number of village gossips whose ac-
quaintance he had cultivated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, Watson, a week in the country will
be invaluable to you,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It is very
pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the
hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again.
With a spud, a tin box, and an elementary book on
botany, there are instructive days to be spent.&#8221; He
prowled about with this equipment himself, but it
was a poor show of plants which he would bring
back of an evening.
</p>
<p>Occasionally in our rambles we came across In-
spector Baynes. His fat, red face wreathed itself in
smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted
my companion. He said little about the case, but
from that little we gathered that he also was not
dissatisfied at the course of events. I must admit,
however, that I was somewhat surprised when,
some five days after the crime, I opened my morn-
ing paper to find in large letters:
</p>
<p>The Oxshott Mystery
a solution
</p>
<p>Arrest of Supposed Assassin
</p>
<p>Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung
when I read the headlines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that
Baynes has got him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said I as I read the following re-
port:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great excitement was caused in Esher
and the neighbouring district when it
was learned late last night that an arrest
had been effected in connection with the
Oxshott murder. It will be remembered that
Mr. Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found
dead on Oxshott Common, his body show-
ing signs of extreme violence, and that on
the same night his servant and his cook
fled, which appeared to show their partic-
ipation in the crime. It was suggested, but
never proved, that the deceased gentleman
</p>
<p>756</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tiger of San Pedro
</p>
<p>may have had valuables in the house, and
that their abstraction was the motive of the
crime. Every effort was made by Inspector
Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascer-
tain the hiding place of the fugitives, and he
had good reason to believe that they had not
gone far but were lurking in some retreat
which had been already prepared. It was
certain from the first, however, that they
would eventually be detected, as the cook,
from the evidence of one or two tradespeople
who have caught a glimpse of him through
the window, was a man of most remark-
able appearance&#8212;being a huge and hideous
mulatto, with yellowish features of a pro-
nounced negroid type. This man has been
seen since the crime, for he was detected
and pursued by Constable Walters on the
same evening, when he had the audacity to
revisit Wisteria Lodge. Inspector Baynes,
considering that such a visit must have
some purpose in view and was likely, there-
fore, to be repeated, abandoned the house
but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery. The
man walked into the trap and was captured
last night after a struggle in which Consta-
ble Downing was badly bitten by the sav-
age. We understand that when the prison
is brought before the magistrates a remand
will be applied for by the police, and that
great developments are hoped from his cap-
ture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really we must see Baynes at once,&#8221; cried
Holmes, picking up his hat. &#8220;We will just catch
him before he starts.&#8221; We hurried down the vil-
lage street and found, as we had expected, that the
inspector was just leaving his lodgings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; he
asked, holding one out to us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Baynes, I&#8217;ve seen it. Pray don&#8217;t think it a
liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of warning, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have looked into this case with some care,
and I am not convinced that you are on the right
lines. I don&#8217;t want you to commit yourself too far
unless you are sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you I speak for your good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed to me that something like a wink
quivered for an instant over one of Mr. Baynes&#8217;s
tiny eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr.
Holmes. That&#8217;s what I am doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very good,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t blame
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I believe you mean well by me. But we
all have our own systems, Mr. Holmes. You have
yours, and maybe I have mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us say no more about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome always to my news. This fel-
low is a perfect savage, as strong as a cart-horse
and as fierce as the devil. He chewed Downing&#8217;s
thumb nearly off before they could master him. He
hardly speaks a word of English, and we can get
nothing out of him but grunts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think you have evidence that he mur-
dered his late master?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so, Mr. Holmes; I didn&#8217;t say so.
We all have our little ways. You try yours and I
will try mine. That&#8217;s the agreement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked
away together. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make the man out. He
seems to be riding for a fall. Well, as he says, we
must each try our own way and see what comes
of it. But there&#8217;s something in Inspector Baynes
which I can&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sit down in that chair, Watson,&#8221; said Sher-
lock Holmes when we had returned to our apart-
ment at the Bull. &#8220;I want to put you in touch with
the situation, as I may need your help to-night.
Let me show you the evolution of this case so far
as I have been able to follow it. Simple as it has
been in its leading features, it has none the less
presented surprising difficulties in the way of an
arrest. There are gaps in that direction which we
have still to fill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go back to the note which was handed
in to Garcia upon the evening of his death. We may
put aside this idea of Baynes&#8217;s that Garcia&#8217;s ser-
vants were concerned in the matter. The proof of
this lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged
for the presence of Scott Eccles, which could only
have been done for the purpose of an alibi. It was
Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and appar-
ently a criminal enterprise, in hand that night in
the course of which he met his death. I say &#8216;crim-
inal&#8217; because only a man with a criminal enter-
prise desires to establish an alibi. Who, then, is
most likely to have taken his life? Surely the per-
son against whom the criminal enterprise was di-
rected. So far it seems to me that we are on safe
ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can now see a reason for the disappear-
ance of Garcia&#8217;s household. They were all con-
federates in the same unknown crime. If it came
off when Garcia returned, any possible suspicion
</p>
<p>757</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
</p>
<p>would be warded off by the Englishman&#8217;s evi-
dence, and all would be well. But the attempt was
a dangerous one, and if Garcia did not return by
a certain hour it was probable that his own life
had been sacrificed. It had been arranged, there-
fore, that in such a case his two subordinates were
to make for some prearranged spot where they
could escape investigation and be in a position af-
terwards to renew their attempt. That would fully
explain the facts, would it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to
straighten out before me. I wondered, as I always
did, how it had not been obvious to me before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should one servant return?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can imagine that in the confusion of flight
something precious, something which he could
not bear to part with, had been left behind. That
would explain his persistence, would it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is the next step?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step is the note received by Garcia at
the dinner. It indicates a confederate at the other
end. Now, where was the other end? I have al-
ready shown you that it could only lie in some
large house, and that the number of large houses is
limited. My first days in this village were devoted
to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my
botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all
the large houses and an examination of the family
history of the occupants. One house, and only one,
riveted my attention. It is the famous old Jacobean
grange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side
of Oxshott, and less than half a mile from the scene
of the tragedy. The other mansions belonged to
prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof
from romance. But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable,
was by all accounts a curious man to whom cu-
rious adventures might befall. I concentrated my
attention, therefore, upon him and his household.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A singular set of people, Watson&#8212;the man
himself the most singular of them all. I managed
to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to
read in his dark, deepset, brooding eyes that he
was perfectly aware of my true business. He is
a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-gray hair,
great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer
and the air of an emperor&#8212;a fierce, masterful man,
with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face.
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the
tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough
as whipcord. His friend and secretary, Mr. Lu-
cas, is undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown,
wily, suave, and catlike, with a poisonous gentle-
ness of speech. You see, Watson, we have come
</p>
<p>already upon two sets of foreigners&#8212;one at Wiste-
ria Lodge and one at High Gable&#8212;so our gaps are
beginning to close.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These two men, close and confidential friends,
are the centre of the household; but there is one
other person who for our immediate purpose may
be even more important. Henderson has two chil-
dren&#8212;girls of eleven and thirteen. Their governess
is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of forty or
thereabouts. There is also one confidential manser-
vant. This little group forms the real family, for
their travel about together, and Henderson is a
great traveller, always on the move. It is only
within the last weeks that he has returned, after
a year&#8217;s absence, to High Gable. I may add that
he is enormously rich, and whatever his whims
may be he can very easily satisfy them. For the
rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidser-
vants, and the usual overfed, underworked staff of
a large English country house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much I learned partly from village gossip
and partly from my own observation. There are no
better instruments than discharged servants with a
grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one. I
call it luck, but it would not have come my way
had I not been looking out for it. As Baynes re-
marks, we all have our systems. It was my sys-
tem which enabled me to find John Warner, late
gardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment of
temper by his imperious employer. He in turn had
friends among the indoor servants who unite in
their fear and dislike of their master. So I had my
key to the secrets of the establishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curious people, Watson! I don&#8217;t pretend to
understand it all yet, but very curious people any-
way. It&#8217;s a double-winged house, and the servants
live on one side, the family on the other. There&#8217;s
no link between the two save for Henderson&#8217;s own
servant, who serves the family&#8217;s meals. Everything
is carried to a certain door, which forms the one
connection. Governess and children hardly go out
at all, except into the garden. Henderson never by
any chance walks alone. His dark secretary is like
his shadow. The gossip among the servants is that
their master is terribly afraid of something. &#8216;Sold
his soul to the devil in exchange for money,&#8217; says
Warner, &#8216;and expects his creditor to come up and
claim his own.&#8217; Where they came from, or who
they are, nobody has an idea. They are very vi-
olent. Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with
his dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy
compensation have kept him out of the courts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation
by this new information. We may take it that the
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tiger of San Pedro
</p>
<p>letter came out of this strange household and was
an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt
which had already been planned. Who wrote the
note? It was someone within the citadel, and it
was a woman. Who then but Miss Burnet, the gov-
erness? All our reasoning seems to point that way.
At any rate, we may take it as a hypothesis and
see what consequences it would entail. I may add
that Miss Burnet&#8217;s age and character make it cer-
tain that my first idea that there might be a love
interest in our story is out of the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If she wrote the note she was presumably the
friend and confederate of Garcia. What, then,
might she be expected to do if she heard of his
death? If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her
lips might be sealed. Still, in her heart, she must
retain bitterness and hatred against those who had
killed him and would presumably help so far as
she could to have revenge upon them. Could we
see her, then and try to use her? That was my first
thought. But now we come to a sinister fact. Miss
Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since
the night of the murder. From that evening she has
utterly vanished. Is she alive? Has she perhaps
met her end on the same night as the friend whom
she had summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner?
There is the point which we still have to decide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will appreciate the difficulty of the situ-
ation, Watson. There is nothing upon which we
can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might
seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The
woman&#8217;s disappearance counts for nothing, since
in that extraordinary household any member of it
might be invisible for a week. And yet she may at
the present moment be in danger of her life. All I
can do is to watch the house and leave my agent,
Warner, on guard at the gates. We can&#8217;t let such
a situation continue. If the law can do nothing we
must take the risk ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suggest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know which is her room. It is accessible from
the top of an outhouse. My suggestion is that you
and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the
very heart of the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not, I must confess, a very alluring
prospect. The old house with its atmosphere of
murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants,
the unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact
that we were putting ourselves legally in a false
position all combined to damp my ardour. But
there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of
Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from
any adventure which he might recommend. One
knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be
</p>
<p>found. I clasped his hand in silence, and the die
was cast.
</p>
<p>But it was not destined that our investigation
should have so adventurous an ending. It was
about five o&#8217;clock, and the shadows of the March
evening were beginning to fall, when an excited
rustic rushed into our room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the
last train. The lady broke away, and I&#8217;ve got her in
a cab downstairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Warner!&#8221; cried Holmes, springing
to his feet. &#8220;Watson, the gaps are closing rapidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from
nervous exhaustion. She bore upon her aquiline
and emaciated face the traces of some recent
tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast,
but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon
us I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the cen-
tre of the broad gray iris. She was drugged with
opium.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I watched at the gate, same as you advised,
Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said our emissary, the discharged
gardener. &#8220;When the carriage came out I followed
it to the station. She was like one walking in her
sleep, but when they tried to get her into the train
she came to life and struggled. They pushed her
into the carriage. She fought her way out again. I
took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are.
I shan&#8217;t forget the face at the carriage window as
I led her away. I&#8217;d have a short life if he had his
way&#8212;the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa,
and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon
cleared her brain from the mists of the drug.
Baynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the
situation rapidly explained to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir, you&#8217;ve got me the very evidence
I want,&#8221; said the inspector warmly, shaking my
friend by the hand. &#8220;I was on the same scent as
you from the first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You were after Henderson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in
the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the
trees in the plantation and saw you down below.
It was just who would get his evidence first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you arrest the mulatto?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Baynes chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt
that he was suspected, and that he would lie low
and make no move so long as he thought he was
in any danger. I arrested the wrong man to make
him believe that our eyes were off him. I knew

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
</p>
<p>he would be likely to clear off then and give us a
chance of getting at Miss Burnet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector&#8217;s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will rise high in your profession. You
have instinct and intuition,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Baynes flushed with pleasure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a plain-clothes man waiting at the sta-
tion all the week. Wherever the High Gable folk go
he will keep them in sight. But he must have been
hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. How-
ever, your man picked her up, and it all ends well.
We can&#8217;t arrest without her evidence, that is clear,
so the sooner we get a statement the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every minute she gets stronger,&#8221; said Holmes,
glancing at the governess. &#8220;But tell me, Baynes,
who is this man Henderson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Henderson,&#8221; the inspector answered, &#8220;is Don
Murillo, once called the Tiger of San Pedro.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Tiger of San Pedro! The whole history
of the man came back to me in a flash. He had
made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty
tyrant that had ever governed any country with a
pretence to civilization. Strong, fearless, and en-
ergetic, he had sufficient virtue to enable him to
impose his odious vices upon a cowering people
for ten or twelve years. His name was a terror
through all Central America. At the end of that
time there was a universal rising against him. But
he was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the
first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly
conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was
manned by devoted adherents. It was an empty
palace which was stormed by the insurgents next
day. The dictator, his two children, his secretary,
and his wealth had all escaped them. From that
moment he had vanished from the world, and his
identity had been a frequent subject for comment
in the European press.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,&#8221;
said Baynes. &#8220;If you look it up you will find that
the San Pedro colours are green and white, same
as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called
himself, but I traced him back, Paris and Rome
and Madrid to Barcelona, where his ship came in
in &#8217;86. They&#8217;ve been looking for him all the time
for their revenge, but it is only now that they have
begun to find him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They discovered him a year ago,&#8221; said Miss
Burnet, who had sat up and was now intently fol-
lowing the conversation. &#8220;Once already his life has
been attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him.
Now, again, it is the noble, chivalrous Garcia who
</p>
<p>has fallen, while the monster goes safe. But an-
other will come, and yet another, until some day
justice will be done; that is as certain as the rise of
to-morrow&#8217;s sun.&#8221; Her thin hands clenched, and
her worn face blanched with the passion of her
hatred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how come you into this matter, Miss Bur-
net?&#8221; asked Holmes. &#8220;How can an English lady
join in such a murderous affair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I join in it because there is no other way in the
world by which justice can be gained. What does
the law of England care for the rivers of blood shed
years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of trea-
sure which this man has stolen? To you they are
like crimes committed in some other planet. But
we know. We have learned the truth in sorrow and
in suffering. To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan
Murillo, and no peace in life while his victims still
cry for vengeance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;he was as you say.
I have heard that he was atrocious. But how are
you affected?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you it all. This villain&#8217;s policy was
to murder, on one pretext or another, every man
who showed such promise that he might in time
come to be a dangerous rival. My husband&#8212;yes,
my real name is Signora Victor Durando&#8212;was the
San Pedro minister in London. He met me and
married me there. A nobler man never lived upon
earth. Unhappily, Murillo heard of his excellence,
recalled him on some pretext, and had him shot.
With a premonition of his fate he had refused to
take me with him. His estates were confiscated,
and I was left with a pittance and a broken heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then came the downfall of the tyrant. He
escaped as you have just described. But the
many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest
and dearest had suffered torture and death at his
hands, would not let the matter rest. They banded
themselves into a society which should never be
dissolved until the work was done. It was my
part after we had discovered in the transformed
Henderson the fallen despot, to attach myself to
his household and keep the others in touch with
his movements. This I was able to do by secur-
ing the position of governess in his family. He lit-
tle knew that the woman who faced him at every
meal was the woman whose husband he had hur-
ried at an hour&#8217;s notice into eternity. I smiled on
him, did my duty to his children, and bided my
time. An attempt was made in Paris and failed.
We zig-zagged swiftly here and there over Europe
to throw off the pursuers and finally returned to
this house, which he had taken upon his first ar-
rival in England.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tiger of San Pedro
</p>
<p>&#8220;But here also the ministers of justice were
waiting. Knowing that he would return there, Gar-
cia, who is the son of the former highest dignitary
in San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty com-
panions of humble station, all three fired with the
same reasons for revenge. He could do little dur-
ing the day, for Murillo took every precaution and
never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or
Lopez as he was known in the days of his great-
ness. At night, however, he slept alone, and the
avenger might find him. On a certain evening,
which had been prearranged, I sent my friend final
instructions, for the man was forever on the alert
and continually changed his room. I was to see
that the doors were open and the signal of a green
or white light in a window which faced the drive
was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt
had better be postponed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But everything went wrong with us. In some
way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez, the sec-
retary. He crept up behind me and sprang upon
me just as I had finished the note. He and his
master dragged me to my room and held judg-
ment upon me as a convicted traitress. Then and
there they would have plunged their knives into
me could they have seen how to escape the con-
sequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate,
they concluded that my murder was too danger-
ous. But they determined to get rid forever of Gar-
cia. They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my
arm round until I gave him the address. I swear
that he might have twisted it off had I understood
what it would mean to Garcia. Lopez addressed
the note which I had written, sealed it with his
sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant,
Jose. How they murdered him I do not know, save
that it was Murillo&#8217;s hand who struck him down,
for Lopez had remained to guard me. I believe he
must have waited among the gorse bushes through
which the path winds and struck him down as he
passed. At first they were of a mind to let him
enter the house and to kill him as a detected bur-
glar; but they argued that if they were mixed up
in an inquiry their own identity would at once be
publicly disclosed and they would be open to fur-
ther attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit
might cease, since such a death might frighten oth-
ers from the task.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All would now have been well for them had
it not been for my knowledge of what they had
done. I have no doubt that there were times when
my life hung in the balance. I was confined to my
room, terrorized by the most horrible threats, cru-
elly ill-used to break my spirit&#8212;see this stab on
my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of
</p>
<p>my arms&#8212;and a gag was thrust into my mouth on
the one occasion when I tried to call from the win-
dow. For five days this cruel imprisonment con-
tinued, with hardly enough food to hold body and
soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was
brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew
that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I re-
member being half-led, half-carried to the carriage;
in the same state I was conveyed to the train. Only
then, when the wheels were almost moving, did
I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own
hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back,
and had it not been for the help of this good man,
who led me to the cab, I should never had broken
away. Now, thank God, I am beyond their power
forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had all listened intently to this remarkable
statement. It was Holmes who broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our difficulties are not over,&#8221; he remarked,
shaking his head. &#8220;Our police work ends, but ou
