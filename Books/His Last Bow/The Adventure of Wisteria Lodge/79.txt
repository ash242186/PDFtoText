<p>CHAPTER I.
The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>find it recorded in my notebook that it
was a bleak and windy day towards the
end of March in the year 1892. Holmes
had received a telegram while we sat
</p>
<p>at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He
made no remark, but the matter remained in his
thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire after-
wards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe,
and casting an occasional glance at the message.
Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous
twinkle in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as
a man of letters,&#8221; said he. &#8220;How do you define the
word &#8216;grotesque&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange&#8212;remarkable,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>He shook his head at my definition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is surely something more than that,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;some underlying suggestion of the tragic
and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to
some of those narratives with which you have af-
flicted a long-suffering public, you will recognize
how often the grotesque has deepened into the
criminal. Think of that little affair of the red-
headed men. That was grotesque enough in the
outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at
robbery. Or, again, there was that most grotesque
affair of the five orange pips, which let straight to
a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the
alert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you it there?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>He read the telegram aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have just had most incredible and
grotesque experience. May I consult
you?
</p>
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Scott Eccles,
&#8220;Post Office, Charing Cross.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man or woman?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever
send a reply-paid telegram. She would have
come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you see him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson, you know how bored I have
been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. My
mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces
because it is not connected up with the work for
which it was built. Life is commonplace, the pa-
pers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to
</p>
<p>have passed forever from the criminal world. Can
you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into
any new problem, however trivial it may prove?
But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A measured step was heard upon the stairs,
and a moment later a stout, tall, gray-whiskered
and solemnly respectable person was ushered into
the room. His life history was written in his heavy
features and pompous manner. From his spats to
his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative,
a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and con-
ventional to the last degree. But some amazing ex-
perience had disturbed his native composure and
left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, an-
gry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He
plunged instantly into his business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a most singular and unpleasant ex-
perience, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Never in my life
have I been placed in such a situation. It is most
improper&#8212;most outrageous. I must insist upon
some explanation.&#8221; He swelled and puffed in his
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,&#8221; said Holmes
in a soothing voice. &#8220;May I ask, in the first place,
why you came to me at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter
which concerned the police, and yet, when you
have heard the facts, you must admit that I could
not leave it where it was. Private detectives are a
class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy,
but none the less, having heard your name&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. But, in the second place, why did
you not come at once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
Holmes glanced at his watch.
&#8220;It is a quarter-past two,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your tele-
</p>
<p>gram was dispatched about one. But no one can
glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that
your disturbance dates from the moment of your
waking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair
and felt his unshaven chin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a
thought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out
of such a house. But I have been running round
making inquiries before I came to you. I went to
the house agents, you know, and they said that Mr.
Garcia&#8217;s rent was paid up all right and that every-
thing was in order at Wisteria Lodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, sir,&#8221; said Holmes, laughing.
&#8220;You are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a
</p>
<p>749</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
</p>
<p>bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost.
Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in
their due sequence, exactly what those events are
which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt,
with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in
search of advice and assistance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client looked down with a rueful face at
his own unconventional appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes,
and I am not aware that in my whole life such a
thing has ever happened before. But will tell you
the whole queer business, and when I have done
so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been
enough to excuse me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There
was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the
door to usher in two robust and official-looking
individuals, one of whom was well known to us
as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an ener-
getic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capa-
ble officer. He shook hands with Holmes and in-
troduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the
Surrey Constabulary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our
trail lay in this direction.&#8221; He turned his bulldog
eyes upon our visitor. &#8220;Are you Mr. John Scott Ec-
cles, of Popham House, Lee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
&#8220;We have been following you about all the
</p>
<p>morning.&#8221;
&#8220;You traced him through the telegram, no
</p>
<p>doubt,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent
</p>
<p>at Charing Cross Post-Office and came on here.&#8221;
&#8220;But why do you follow me? What do you
</p>
<p>want?&#8221;
&#8220;We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to
</p>
<p>the events which let up to the death last night of
Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Es-
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client had sat up with staring eyes and ev-
ery tinge of colour struck from his astonished face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead? Did you say he was dead?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, he is dead.&#8221;
&#8220;But how? An accident?&#8221;
&#8220;Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.&#8221;
&#8220;Good God! This is awful! You don&#8217;t
</p>
<p>mean&#8212;you don&#8217;t mean that I am suspected?&#8221;
&#8220;A letter of yours was found in the dead man&#8217;s
</p>
<p>pocket, and we know by it that you had planned
to pass last night at his house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, you did, did you?&#8221;
Out came the official notebook.
&#8220;Wait a bit, Gregson,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?&#8221;
&#8220;And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles
</p>
<p>that it may be used against him.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when
</p>
<p>you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy
and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I sug-
gest that you take no notice of this addition to your
audience, and that you proceed with your narra-
tive exactly as you would have done had you never
been interrupted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the
colour had returned to his face. With a dubious
glance at the inspector&#8217;s notebook, he plunged at
once into his extraordinary statement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a bachelor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and being of
a sociable turn I cultivate a large number of
friends. Among these are the family of a retired
brewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Man-
sion, Kensington. It was at his table that I met
some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He
was, I understood, of Spanish descent and con-
nected in some way with the embassy. He spoke
perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and
as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In some way we struck up quite a friendship,
this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy
to me from the first, and within two days of our
meeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led
to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to
spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge,
between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I
went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had described his household to me before
I went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a
countryman of his own, who looked after all his
needs. This fellow could speak English and did
his housekeeping for him. Then there was a won-
derful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had
picked up in his travels, who could serve an ex-
cellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what
a queer household it was to find in the heart of
Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has
proved a good deal queerer than I thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove to the place&#8212;about two miles on the
south side of Esher. The house was a fair-sized
one, standing back from the road, with a curv-
ing drive which was banked with high evergreen
shrubs. It was an old, tumbledown building in a
crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up
on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched
</p>
<p>750</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles
</p>
<p>and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my
wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly.
He opened the door himself, however, and greeted
me with a great show of cordiality. I was handed
over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy in-
dividual, who led the way, my bag in his hand,
to my bedroom. The whole place was depress-
ing. Our dinner was te&#770;te-a&#768;-te&#770;te, and though my
host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts
seemed to continually wander, and he talked so
vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand
him. He continually drummed his fingers on the
table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of
nervous impatience. The dinner itself was neither
well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy pres-
ence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven
us. I can assure you that many times in the course
of the evening I wished that I could invent some
excuse which would take me back to Lee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing comes back to my memory which
may have a bearing upon the business that you two
gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of
it at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was
handed in by the servant. I noticed that after my
host had read it he seemed even more distrait and
strange than before. He gave up all pretence at
conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes,
lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark
as to the contents. About eleven I was glad to go
to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my
door&#8212;the room was dark at the time&#8212;and asked
me if I had rung. I said that I had not. He apolo-
gized for having disturbed me so late, saying that
it was nearly one o&#8217;clock. I dropped off after this
and slept soundly all night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I come to the amazing part of my
tale. When I woke it was broad daylight. I glanced
at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I
had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I
was very much astonished at this forgetfulness. I
sprang up and rang for the servant. There was no
response. I rang again and again, with the same
result. Then I came to the conclusion that the bell
was out of order. I huddled on my clothes and
hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper
to order some hot water. You can imagine my sur-
prise when I found that there was no one there. I
shouted in the hall. There was no answer. Then
I ran from room to room. All were deserted. My
host had shown me which was his bedroom the
night before, so I knocked at the door. No reply. I
turned the handle and walked in. The room was
empty, and the bed had never been slept in. He
had gone with the rest. The foreign host, the for-
eign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in
</p>
<p>the night! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria
Lodge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and
chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his
collection of strange episodes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly
unique,&#8221; said he. &#8220;May I ask, sir, what you did
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was furious. My first idea was that I had
been the victim of some absurd practical joke. I
packed my things, banged the hall door behind
me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand.
I called at Allan Brothers&#8217;, the chief land agents in
the village, and found that it was from this firm
that the villa had been rented. It struck me that
the whole proceeding could hardly be for the pur-
pose of making a fool of me, and that the main
objet must be to get out of the rent. It is late in
March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this theory
would not work. The agent was obliged to me for
my warning, but told me that the rent had been
paid in advance. Then I made my way to town
and called at the Spanish embassy. The man was
unknown there. After this I went to see Melville,
at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found
that he really knew rather less about him than I
did. Finally when I got your reply to my wire I
came out to you, since I gather that you are a per-
son who gives advice in difficult cases. But now,
Mr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said
when you entered the room, that you can carry
the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred.
I can assure you that every word I have said is the
truth, and that, outside of what I have told you,
I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this
man. My only desire is to help the law in every
possible way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles&#8212;I am sure of
it,&#8221; said Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone.
&#8220;I am bound to say that everything which you have
said agrees very closely with the facts as they have
come to our notice. For example, there was that
note which arrived during dinner. Did you chance
to observe what became of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into
the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The country detective was a stout, puffy, red
man, whose face was only redeemed from gross-
ness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost
hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and
brow. With a slow smile he drew a folded and
discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.
</p>
<p>751</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he over-
pitched it. I picked this out unburned from the
back of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled his appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have examined the house very care-
fully to find a single pellet of paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Mr. Holmes. It&#8217;s my way. Shall I read it,
Mr. Gregson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Londoner nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid
paper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet.
The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-
bladed scissors. It has been folded over three times
and sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and
pressed down with some flat oval object. It is ad-
dressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own colours, green and white.
Green open, white shut. Main stair,
first corridor, seventh right, green
baize. Godspeed.
</p>
<p>&#8212; D.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a woman&#8217;s writing, done with a sharp-
pointed pen, but the address is either done with
another pen or by someone else. It is thicker and
bolder, as you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very remarkable note,&#8221; said Holmes, glanc-
ing it over. &#8220;I must compliment you, Mr. Baynes,
upon your attention to detail in your examina-
tion of it. A few trifling points might perhaps
be added. The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain
sleeve-link&#8212;what else is of such a shape? The scis-
sors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips
are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in
each.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The country detective chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of
it, but I see there was a little over,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
bound to say that I make nothing of the note ex-
cept that there was something on hand, and that a
woman, as usual, was at the bottom of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during
this conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you found the note, since it corrob-
orates my story,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I beg to point out
that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr.
Garcia, nor what has become of his household.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As to Garcia,&#8221; said Gregson, &#8220;that is eas-
ily answered. He was found dead this morning
upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his
home. His head had been smashed to pulp by
</p>
<p>heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instru-
ment, which had crushed rather than wounded.
It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within
a quarter of a mile of the spot. He had apparently
been struck down first from behind, but his as-
sailant had gone on beating him long after he was
dead. It was a most furious assault. There are no
footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbed?&#8221;
&#8220;No, there was no attempt at robbery.&#8221;
&#8220;This is very painful&#8212;very painful and terri-
</p>
<p>ble,&#8221; said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice,
&#8220;but it is really uncommonly hard on me. I had
nothing to do with my host going off upon a noc-
turnal excursion and meeting so sad an end. How
do I come to be mixed up with the case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very simply, sir,&#8221; Inspector Baynes answered.
&#8220;The only document found in the pocket of the
deceased was a letter from you saying that you
would be with him on the night of his death. It was
the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead
man&#8217;s name and address. It was after nine this
morning when we reached his house and found
neither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to
Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I
examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town,
joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think now,&#8221; said Gregson, rising, &#8220;we had
best put this matter into an official shape. You will
come round with us to the station, Mr. Scott Eccles,
and let us have your statement in writing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain
your services, Mr. Holmes. I desire you to spare
no expense and no pains to get at the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend turned to the country inspector.
&#8220;I suppose that you have no objection to my
</p>
<p>collaborating with you, Mr. Baynes?&#8221;
&#8220;Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.&#8221;
&#8220;You appear to have been very prompt and
</p>
<p>businesslike in all that you have done. Was there
any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the
man met his death?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had been there since one o&#8217;clock. There
was rain about that time, and his death had cer-
tainly been before the rain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,&#8221;
cried our client. &#8220;His voice is unmistakable. I
could swear to it that it was he who addressed me
in my bedroom at that very hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkable, but by no means impossible,&#8221;
said Holmes, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a clue?&#8221; asked Gregson.
</p>
<p>752</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the face of it the case is not a very com-
plex one, though it certainly presents some novel
and interesting features. A further knowledge of
facts is necessary before I would venture to give a
final and definite opinion. By the way, Mr. Baynes,
did you find anything remarkable besides this note
in your examination of the house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective looked at my friend in a singular
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were,&#8221; said he, &#8220;one or two very remark-
able things. Perhaps when I have finished at the
police-station you would care to come out and give
me your opinion of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In am entirely at your service,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes, ringing the bell. &#8220;You will show these
gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send the
boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling
reply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We sat for some time in silence after our vis-
itors had left. Holmes smoked hard, with his
browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his
head thrust forward in the eager way characteris-
tic of the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Watson,&#8221; he asked, turning suddenly
upon me, &#8220;what do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make nothing of this mystification of
Scott Eccles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the crime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, taken with the disappearance of the
man&#8217;s companions, I should say that they were in
some way concerned in the murder and had fled
from justice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is certainly a possible point of view. On
the face of it you must admit, however, that it
is very strange that his two servants should have
been in a conspiracy against him and should have
attacked him on the one night when he had a
guest. They had him alone at their mercy every
other night in the week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did they fly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big
fact. Another big fact is the remarkable experience
of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is
it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish
an explanation which would cover both of these
big facts? If it were one which would also ad-
mit of the mysterious note with its very curious
phraseology, why, then it would be worth accept-
ing as a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts
which come to our knowledge all fit themselves
into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradu-
ally become a solution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is our hypothesis?&#8221;
Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-
</p>
<p>closed eyes.
&#8220;You must admit, my dear Watson, that the
