<p>n choosing a few typical cases which il-
lustrate the remarkable mental qualities
of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have
endeavoured, as far as possible, to se-
</p>
<p>lect those which presented the minimum of sen-
sationalism, while offering a fair field for his tal-
ents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible en-
tirely to separate the sensational from the crimi-
nal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he
must either sacrifice details which are essential to
his statement and so give a false impression of the
problem, or he must use matter which chance, and
not choice, has provided him with. With this short
preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to
be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of
events.
</p>
<p>It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street
was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight
upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the
road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe
that these were the same walls which loomed so
gloomily through the fogs of winter. Our blinds
were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the
sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had
received by the morning post. For myself, my term
of service in India had trained me to stand heat
better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was
no hardship. But the morning paper was uninter-
esting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out
of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New
Forest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank
account had caused me to postpone my holiday,
and as to my companion, neither the country nor
the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.
He loved to lie in the very center of five millions
of people, with his filaments stretching out and
running through them, responsive to every little
rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreci-
ation of nature found no place among his many
gifts, and his only change was when he turned his
mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down
his brother of the country.
</p>
<p>Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for con-
versation I had tossed side the barren paper, and
leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown study.
Suddenly my companion&#8217;s voice broke in upon my
thoughts:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It does seem
a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most preposterous!&#8221; I exclaimed, and then
suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost
thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared
at him in blank amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, Holmes?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;This is be-
yond anything which I could have imagined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed heartily at my perplexity.
&#8220;You remember,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that some little time
</p>
<p>ago when I read you the passage in one of Poe&#8217;s
sketches in which a close reasoner follows the un-
spoken thoughts of his companion, you were in-
clined to treat the matter as a mere tour-de-force of
the author. On my remarking that I was constantly
in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed
incredulity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Wat-
</p>
<p>son, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I
saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a
train of thought, I was very happy to have the op-
portunity of reading it off, and eventually of break-
ing into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I was still far from satisfied. &#8220;In the exam-
ple which you read to me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the reasoner
drew his conclusions from the actions of the man
whom he observed. If I remember right, he stum-
bled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars,
and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my
chair, and what clues can I have given you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do yourself an injustice. The features
are given to man as the means by which he shall
express his emotions, and yours are faithful ser-
vants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you read my train of
thoughts from my features?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your features and especially your eyes. Per-
haps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie
commenced?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I will tell you. After throwing down
</p>
<p>your paper, which was the action which drew my
attention to you, you sat for half a minute with
a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed them-
selves upon your newly framed picture of General
Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face
that a train of thought had been started. But it
did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across
to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher
which stands upon the top of your books. Then
you glanced up at the wall, and of course your
meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if
the portrait were framed it would just cover that
bare space and correspond with Gordon&#8217;s picture
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have followed me wonderfully!&#8221; I ex-
claimed.
</p>
<p>765</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far I could hardly have gone astray. But
now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you
looked hard across as if you were studying the
character in his features. Then your eyes ceased
to pucker, but you continued to look across, and
your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the
incidents of Beecher&#8217;s career. I was well aware that
you could not do this without thinking of the mis-
sion which he undertook on behalf of the North
at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your
expressing your passionate indignation at the way
in which he was received by the more turbulent
of our people. You felt so strongly about it that
I knew you could not think of Beecher without
thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw
your eyes wander away from the picture, I sus-
pected that your mind had now turned to the Civil
War, and when I observed that your lips set, your
eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched I was pos-
itive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry
which was shown by both sides in that desperate
struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder,
you shook your head. You were dwelling upon
the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.
Your hand stole towards your own old wound and
a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me
that the ridiculous side of this method of settling
international questions had forced itself upon your
mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was
preposterous and was glad to find that all my de-
ductions had been correct.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221; said I. &#8220;And now that you have
explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as be-
fore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I as-
sure you. I should not have intruded it upon your
attention had you not shown some incredulity the
other day. But I have in my hands here a little
problem which may prove to be more difficult of
solution than my small essay I thought reading.
Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph
referring to the remarkable contents of a packet
sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross
Street, Croydon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I saw nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! then you must have overlooked it. Just
toss it over to me. Here it is, under the financial
column. Perhaps you would be good enough to
read it aloud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I picked up the paper which he had thrown
back to me and read the paragraph indicated. It
was headed, &#8220;A Gruesome Packet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross
Street, Croydon, has been made the victim
of what must be regarded as a peculiarly re-
volting practical joke unless some more sin-
ister meaning should prove to be attached to
the incident. At two o&#8217;clock yesterday after-
noon a small packet, wrapped in brown pa-
per, was handed in by the postman. A card-
board box was inside, which was filled with
coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cush-
ing was horrified to find two human ears,
apparently quite freshly severed. The box
had been sent by parcel post from Belfast
upon the morning before. There is no in-
dication as to the sender, and the matter
is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing,
who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most
retired life, and has so few acquaintances
or correspondents that it is a rare event for
her to receive anything through the post.
Some years ago, however, when she resided
at Penge, she let apartments in her house
to three young medical students, whom she
was obliged to get rid of on account of their
noisy and irregular habits. The police are
of opinion that this outrage may have been
perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these
youths, who owed her a grudge and who
hoped to frighten her by sending her these
relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some proba-
bility is lent to the theory by the fact that
one of these students came from the north of
Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing&#8217;s
belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the
matter is being actively investigated, Mr.
Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our de-
tective officers, being in charge of the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much for the Daily Chronicle,&#8221; said Holmes as
I finished reading. &#8220;Now for our friend Lestrade.
I had a note from him this morning, in which he
says:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this case is very much in
your line. We have every hope of clear-
ing the matter up, but we find a little
difficulty in getting anything to work
upon. We have, of course, wired to the
Belfast post-office, but a large number
of parcels were handed in upon that
day, and they have no means of identi-
fying this particular one, or of remem-
bering the sender. The box is a half-
pound box of honeydew tobacco and
does not help us in any way. The medi-
cal student theory still appears to me to
</p>
<p>766</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>be the most feasible, but if you should
have a few hours to spare I should be
very happy to see you out here. I shall
be either at the house or in the police-
station all day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What say you, Watson? Can you rise superior
to the heat and run down to Croydon with me on
the off chance of a case for your annals?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was longing for something to do.&#8221;
&#8220;You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and
</p>
<p>tell them to order a cab. I&#8217;ll be back in a moment
when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled
my cigar-case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shower of rain fell while we were in the train,
and the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon
than in town. Holmes had sent on a wire, so that
Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as
ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of
five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss
Cushing resided.
</p>
<p>It was a very long street of two-story brick
houses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps
and little groups of aproned women gossiping at
the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and
tapped at a door, which was opened by a small
servant girl. Miss Cushing was sitting in the front
room, into which we were ushered. She was a
placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and
grizzled hair curving down over her temples on
each side. A worked antimacassar lay upon her
lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a
stool beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in the outhouse, those dreadful
things,&#8221; said she as Lestrade entered. &#8220;I wish that
you would take them away altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them
here until my friend, Mr. Holmes, should have
seen them in your presence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in my presence, sir?&#8221;
&#8220;In case he wished to ask any questions.&#8221;
&#8220;What is the use of asking me questions when
</p>
<p>I tell you I know nothing whatever about it?&#8221;
&#8220;Quite so, madam,&#8221; said Holmes in his sooth-
</p>
<p>ing way. &#8220;I have no doubt that you have been an-
noyed more than enough already over this busi-
ness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and
live a retired life. It is something new for me to
see my name in the papers and to find the police
in my house. I won&#8217;t have those things I here, Mr.
Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to
the outhouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a small shed in the narrow garden which
ran behind the house. Lestrade went in and
brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece
of brown paper and some string. There was a
bench at the end of the path, and we all sat down
while Homes examined one by one, the articles
which Lestrade had handed to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The string is exceedingly interesting,&#8221; he re-
marked, holding it up to the light and sniffing at
it. &#8220;What do you make of this string, Lestrade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been tarred.&#8221;
&#8220;Precisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You
</p>
<p>have also, no doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing
has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen
by the double fray on each side. This is of impor-
tance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot see the importance,&#8221; said Lestrade.
&#8220;The importance lies in the fact that the knot is
</p>
<p>left intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar char-
acter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very neatly tied. I had already made a
note of that effect,&#8221; said Lestrade complacently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much for the string, then,&#8221; said Holmes,
smiling, &#8220;now for the box wrapper. Brown paper,
with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you not
observe it? I think there can be no doubt of it. Ad-
dress printed in rather straggling characters: &#8216;Miss
S. Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.&#8217; Done with a
broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very in-
ferior ink. The word &#8216;Croydon&#8217; has been originally
spelled with an &#8216;i&#8217;, which has been changed to
&#8216;y&#8217;. The parcel was directed, then, by a man&#8212;the
printing is distinctly masculine&#8212;of limited educa-
tion and unacquainted with the town of Croydon.
So far, so good! The box is a yellow, half-pound
honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two
thumb marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled
with rough salt of the quality used for preserv-
ing hides and other of the coarser commercial pur-
poses. And embedded in it are these very singular
enclosures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took out the two ears as he spoke, and lay-
ing a board across his knee he examined them
minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward
on each side of him, glanced alternately at these
dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of
our companion. Finally he returned them to the
box once more and sat for a while in deep medita-
tion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have observed, of course,&#8221; said he at last,
&#8220;that the ears are not a pair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have noticed that. But if this were
the practical joke of some students from the
</p>
<p>767</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box
</p>
<p>dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to
send two odd ears as a pair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. But this is not a practical joke.&#8221;
&#8220;You are sure of it?&#8221;
&#8220;The presumption is strongly against it. Bodies
</p>
<p>in the dissecting-rooms are injected with preserva-
tive fluid. These ears bear no signs of this. They
are fresh, too. They have been cut off with a
blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if
a student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified
spirits would be the preservatives which would
suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly
not rough salt. I repeat that there is no practical
joke here, but that we are investigating a serious
crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to
my companion&#8217;s words and saw the stern grav-
ity which had hardened his features. This bru-
tal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some
strange and inexplicable horror in the background.
Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who
is only half convinced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are objections to the joke theory, no
doubt,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but there are much stronger rea-
sons against the other. We know that this woman
has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge
and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly
been away from her home for a day during that
time. Why on earth, then, should any criminal
send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, un-
less she is a most consummate actress, she under-
stands quite as little of the matter as we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the problem which we have to solve,&#8221;
Holmes answered, &#8220;and for my part I shall set
about it by presuming that my reasoning is cor-
rect, and that a double murder has been commit-
ted. One of these ears is a woman&#8217;s, small, finely
formed, and pierced for an earring. The other is a
man&#8217;s, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced
for an earring. These two people are presumably
dead, or we should have heard their story before
now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on
Thursday morning. The tragedy, then, occurred
on Wednesday or Tuesday, or earlier. If the two
people were murdered, who but their murderer
would have sent this sign of his work to Miss
Cushing? We may take it that the sender of the
packet is the man whom we want. But he must
have some strong reason for sending Miss Cush-
ing this packet. What reason then? It must have
been to tell her that the deed was done! or to
pain her, perhaps. But in that case she knows who
it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew,
why should she call the police in? She might have
</p>
<p>buried the ears, and no one would have been the
wiser. That is what she would have done if she
had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does
not wish to shield him she would give his name.
There is a tangle here which needs straightening
to.&#8221; He had been talking in a high, quick voice,
staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now
he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards
the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,&#8221;
said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I may leave you here,&#8221; said
Lestrade, &#8220;for I have another small business on
hand. I think that I have nothing further to learn
from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the police-
station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall look in on our way to the train,&#8221; an-
swered Holmes. A moment later he and I were
back in the front room, where the impassive lady
was still quietly working away at her antimacas-
sar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and
looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that this mat-
ter is a mistake, and that the parcel was never
meant for me at all. I have said this several times to
the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply
laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as
far as I know, so why should anyone play me such
a trick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss
Cushing,&#8221; said Holmes, taking a seat beside her. &#8220;I
think that it is more than probable&#8212;&#8221; He paused,
and I was surprised, on glancing round to see
that he was staring with singular intentness at
the lady&#8217;s profile. Surprise and satisfaction were
both for an instant to be read upon his eager face,
though when she glanced round to find out the
cause of his silence he had become as demure as
ever. I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair,
her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid fea-
tures; but I could see nothing which could account
for my companion&#8217;s evident excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were one or two questions&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, I am weary of questions!&#8221; cried Miss
</p>
<p>Cushing impatiently.
&#8220;You have two sisters, I believe.&#8221;
&#8220;How could you know that?&#8221;
&#8220;I observed the very instant that I entered the
</p>
<p>room that you have a portrait group of three ladies
upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is undoubt-
edly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly
like you that there could be no doubt of the rela-
tionship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>768</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Yes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters,
Sarah and Mary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here at my elbow is another portrait,
taken at Liverpool, of your younger sister, in the
company of a man who appears to be a steward
by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried
at the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very quick at observing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my trade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are quite right. But she was married
to Mr. Browner a few days afterwards. He was on
the South American line when that was taken, but
he was so fond of her that he couldn&#8217;t abide to
leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool
and London boats.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the May Day, when last I heard. Jim
came down here to see me once. That was be-
fore he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would
always take drink when he was ashore, and a lit-
tle drink would send him stark, staring mad. Ah!
it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his
hand again. First he dropped me, then he quar-
relled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped
writing we don&#8217;t know how things are going with
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evident that Miss Cushing had come
upon a subject on which she felt very deeply. Like
most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy
at first, but ended by becoming extremely com-
municative. She told us many details about her
brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering
off on the subject of her former lodgers, the med-
ical students, she gave us a long account of their
delinquencies, with their names and those of their
hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to every-
thing, throwing in a question from time to time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About your second sister, Sarah,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
wonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you
do not keep house together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! you don&#8217;t know Sarah&#8217;s temper or you
would wonder no more. I tried it when I came to
Croydon, and we kept on until about two months
ago, when we had to part. I don&#8217;t want to say a
word against my own sister, but she was always
meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that she quarrelled with your Liver-
pool relations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and they were the best of friends at one
time. Why, she went up there to live in order to be
near them. And now she has no word hard enough
for Jim Browner. The last six months that she was
</p>
<p>here she would speak of nothing but his drinking
and his ways. He had caught her meddling, I sus-
pect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was
the start of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Cushing,&#8221; said Holmes, ris-
ing and bowing. &#8220;Your sister Sarah lives, I think
you said, at New Street, Wallington? Good-bye,
and I am very sorry that you should have been
troubled over a case with which, as you say, you
have nothing whatever to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a cab passing as we came out, and
Holmes hailed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far to Wallington?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Only about a mile, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike
</p>
<p>while the iron is hot. Simple as the case is, there
have been one or two very instructive details in
connection with it. Just pull up at a telegraph of-
fice as you pass, cabby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest
of the drive lay back in the cab, with his hat tilted
over his nose to keep the sun from his face. Our
drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike
the one which we had just quitted. My compan-
ion ordered him to wait, and had his hand upon
the knocker, when the door opened and a grave
young gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat,
appeared on the step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Miss Cushing at home?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been suffering since yesterday from brain
symptoms of great severity. As her medical ad-
viser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of
allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend
you to call again in ten days.&#8221; He drew on his
gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the
street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if we can&#8217;t we can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Holmes,
cheerfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she could not or would not have told
you much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only
wanted to look at her. However, I think that I have
got all that I want. Drive us to some decent hotel,
cabby, where we may have some lunch, and after-
wards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade
at the police-station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had a pleasant little meal together, during
which Holmes would talk about nothing but vio-
lins, narrating with great exultation how he had
purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth
at least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker&#8217;s in
Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five shillings. This
led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over

</p>
<p>a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after
anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon
was far advanced and the hot glare had softened
into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at
the police-station. Lestrade was waiting for us at
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! It is the answer!&#8221; He tore it open, glanced
his eyes over it, and crumpled it into his pocket.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found out anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found out everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Lestrade stared at him in amazement.
&#8220;You are joking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never more serious in my life. A shock-
ing crime has been committed, and I think I have
now laid bare every detail of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the criminal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back
of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to
Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the name,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You cannot effect
an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest. I
should prefer that you do not mention my name
at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be
only associated with those crimes which present
some difficulty in their solution. Come on, Wat-
son.&#8221; We strode off together to the station, leaving
Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the
card which Holmes had thrown him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The case,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes as we chat-
ted over or cigars that night in our rooms at
Baker Street, &#8220;is one where, as in the investiga-
tions which you have chronicled under the names
of &#8216;A Study in Scarlet&#8217; and of &#8216;The Sign of Four,&#8217;
we have been compelled to reason backward from
effects to causes. I have written to Lestrade asking
him to supply us with the details which are now
wanting, and which he will only get after he had
secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to
do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason,
he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once un-
derstands what he has to do, and indeed, it is just
this tenacity which has brought him to the top at
Scotland Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your case is not complete, then?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is fairly complete in essentials. We know
who the author of the revolting business is, al-
though one of the victims still escapes us. Of
course, you have formed your own conclusions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward
of a Liverpool boat, is the man whom you sus-
pect?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! it is more than a suspicion.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet I cannot see anything save very vague
</p>
<p>indications.&#8221;
&#8220;On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be
</p>
<p>more clear. Let me run over the principal steps.
We approached the case, you remember, with an
absolutely blank mind, which is always an advan-
tage. We had formed no theories. We were sim-
ply there to observe and to draw inferences from
our observations. What did we see first? A very
placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite in-
nocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed
me that she had two younger sisters. It instantly
flashed across my mind that the box might have
been meant for one of these. I set the idea aside
as one which could be disproved or confirmed at
our leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you
remember, and we saw the very singular contents
of the little yellow box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The string was of the quality which is used
by sail-makers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of
the sea was perceptible in our investigation. When
I observed that the knot was one which is popu-
lar with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at
a port, and that the male ear was pierced for an
earring which is so much more common among
sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all
the actors in the tragedy were to be found among
our seafaring classes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came to examine the address of the
packet I observed that it was to Miss S. Cushing.
Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be Miss
Cushing, and although her initial was &#8216;S&#8217; it might
belong to one of the others as well. In that case we
should have to commence our investigation from
a fresh basis altogether. I therefore went into the
house with the intention of clearing up this point.
I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was con-
vinced that a mistake had been made when you
may remember that I came suddenly to a stop. The
fact was that I had just seen something which filled
me with surprise and at the same time narrowed
the field of our inquiry immensely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a medical man, you are aware, Watson,
that there is no part of the body which varies so
much as the human ear. Each ear is as a rule
quite distinctive and differs from all other ones.
In last year&#8217;s Anthropological Journal you will find
two short monographs from my pen upon the sub-
ject. I had, therefore, examined the ears in the
box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully
</p>
<p>770</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my
surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing
I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with
the female ear which I had just inspected. The mat-
ter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was
the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad
curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of
the inner cartilage. In all essentials it was the same
ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, her sister&#8217;s name was Sarah,
and her address had until recently been the same,
so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had
occurred and for whom the packet was meant.
Then we heard of this steward, married to the third
sister, and learned that he had at one time been
so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually
gone up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but
a quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quar-
rel had put a stop to all communications for some
months, so that if Browner had occasion to ad-
dress a packet to Miss Sarah, he would undoubt-
edly have done so to her old address.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now the matter had begun to straighten
itself out wonderfully. We had learned of the exis-
tence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong
passions&#8212;you remember that he threw up what
must have been a very superior berth in order
to be nearer to his wife&#8212;subject, too, to occa-
sional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to be-
lieve that his wife had been murdered, and that
a man&#8212;presumably a seafaring man&#8212;had been
murdered at the same time. Jealousy, of course,
at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime.
And why should these proofs of the deed be sent
to Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during
her residence in Liverpool she had some hand in
bringing about the events which led to the tragedy.
You will observe that this line of boats call at
Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presum-
ing that Browner had committed the deed and had
embarked at once upon his steamer, the May Day,
Belfast would be the first place at which he could
post his terrible packet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A second solution was at this stage obviously
possible, and although I thought it exceedingly
unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it before
going further. An unsuccessful lover might have
killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear
might have belonged to the husband. There were
many grave objections to this theory, but it was
conceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram to my
friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him
to find out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if
Browner had departed in the May Day. Then we
went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was curious, in the first place, to see how far
the family ear had been reproduced in her. Then,
of course, she might give us very important infor-
mation, but I was not sanguine that she would.
She must have heard of the business the day be-
fore, since all Croydon was ringing with it, and she
alone could have understood for whom the packet
was meant. If she had been willing to help justice
she would probably have communicated with the
police already. However, it was clearly our duty to
see her, so we went. We found that the news of the
arrival of the packet&#8212;for her illness dated from
that time&#8212;had such an effect upon her as to bring
on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she
understood its full significance, but equally clear
that we should have to wait some time for any as-
sistance from her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;However, we were really independent of her
help. Our answers were waiting for us at the
police-station, where I had directed Algar to send
them. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs.
Browner&#8217;s house had been closed for more than
three days, and the neighbours were of opinion
that she had gone south to see her relatives. It
had been ascertained at the shipping offices that
Browner had left aboard of the May Day, and I
calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow
night. When he arrives he will be met by the ob-
tuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt
that we shall have all our details filled in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his
expectations. Two days later he received a bulky
envelope, which contained a short note from the
detective, and a typewritten document, which cov-
ered several pages of foolscap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lestrade has got him all right,&#8221; said Holmes,
glancing up at me. &#8220;Perhaps it would interest you
to hear what he says.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Holmes:
&#8220;In accordance with the scheme
</p>
<p>which we had formed in order to test
our theories&#8221; [&#8220;the &#8216;we&#8217; is rather fine,
Watson, is it not?&#8221;] &#8220;I went down to
the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m.,
and boarded the S.S. May Day, belong-
ing to the Liverpool, Dublin, and Lon-
don Steam Packet Company. On in-
quiry, I found that there was a stew-
ard on board of the name of James
Browner and that he had acted dur-
ing the voyage in such an extraordinary
manner that the captain had been com-
pelled to relieve him of his duties. On
descending to his berth, I found him
</p>
<p>771</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box
</p>
<p>seated upon a chest with his head sunk
upon his hands, rocking himself to and
fro. He is a big, powerful chap, clean-
shaven, and very swarthy&#8212;something
like Aldrige, who helped us in the bo-
gus laundry affair. He jumped up
when he heard my business, and I had
my whistle to my lips to call a couple
of river police, who were round the cor-
ner, but he seemed to have no heart in
him, and he held out his hands quietly
enough for the darbies. We brought
him along to the cells, and his box as
well, for we thought there might be
something incriminating; but, bar a big
sharp knife such as most sailors have,
we got nothing for our trouble. How-
ever, we find that we shall want no
more evidence, for on being brought
before the inspector at the station he
asked leave to make a statement, which
was, of course, taken down, just as he
made it, by our shorthand man. We
had three copies typewritten, one of
which I enclose. The affair proves, as
I always thought it would, to be an ex-
tremely simple one, but I am obliged
to you for assisting me in my investiga-
tion. With kind regards,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours very truly,
&#8220;G. Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! The investigation really was a very sim-
ple one,&#8221; remarked Holmes, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think it
struck him in that light when he first called us in.
However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say
for himself. This is his statement as made before
Inspector Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Sta-
tion, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Have I anything to say? Yes, I have a
deal to say. I have to make a clean breast of
it all. You can hang me, or you can leave
me alone. I don&#8217;t care a plug which you do.
I tell you I&#8217;ve not shut an eye in sleep since
I did it, and I don&#8217;t believe I ever will again
until I get past all waking. Sometimes it&#8217;s
his face, but most generally it&#8217;s hers. I&#8217;m
never without one or the other before me.
He looks frowning and black-like, but she
has a kind o&#8217; surprise upon her face. Ay,
the white lamb, she might well be surprised
when she read death on a face that had sel-
dom looked anything but love upon her be-
fore.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But it was Sarah&#8217;s fault, and may the
curse of a broken man put a blight on her
and set the blood rotting in her veins! It&#8217;s
not that I want to clear myself. I know that
I went back to drink, like the beast that I
was. But she would have forgiven me; she
would have stuck as close to me a rope to a
block if that woman had never darkened our
door. For Sarah Cushing loved me&#8212;that&#8217;s
the root of the business&#8212;she loved me until
all her love turned to poisonous hate when
she knew that I thought more of my wife&#8217;s
footmark in the mud than I did of her whole
body and soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There were three sisters altogether. The
old one was just a good woman, the sec-
ond was a devil, and the third was an an-
gel. Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was
twenty-nine when I married. We were just
as happy as the day was long when we set
up house together, and in all Liverpool there
was no better woman than my Mary. And
then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the
week grew into a month, and one thing led
to another, until she was just one of our-
selves.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I was blue ribbon at that time, and we
were putting a little money by, and all was
as bright as a new dollar. My God, whoever
would have thought that it could have come
to this? Whoever would have dreamed it?
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I used to be home for the week-ends very
often, and sometimes if the ship were held
back for cargo I would have a whole week
at a time, and in this way I saw a deal of
my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine tall
woman, black and quick and fierce, with a
proud way of carrying her head, and a glint
from her eye like a spark from a flint. But
when little Mary was there I had never a
thought of her, and that I swear as I hope
for God&#8217;s mercy.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It had seemed to me sometimes that she
liked to be alone with me, or to coax me
out for a walk with her, but I had never
thought anything of that. But one evening
my eyes were opened. I had come up from
the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah
at home. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mary?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Oh,
she has gone to pay some accounts.&#8221; I was
impatient and paced up and down the room.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you be happy for five minutes with-
out Mary, Jim?&#8221; says she. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad
</p>
<p>772</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>compliment to me that you can&#8217;t be con-
tented with my society for so short a time.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, my lass,&#8221; said I, putting
out my hand towards her in a kindly way,
but she had it in both hers in an instant,
and they burned as if they were in a fever.
I looked into her eyes and I read it all there.
There was no need for her to speak, nor for
me either. I frowned and drew my hand
away. Then she stood by my side in silence
for a bit, and then put up her hand and pat-
ted me on the shoulder. &#8220;Steady old Jim!&#8221;
said she, and with a kind o&#8217; mocking laugh,
she ran out of the room.
&#8220; &#8216;Well, from that time Sarah hated me with
her whole heart and soul, and she is a
woman who can hate, too. I was a fool
to let her go on biding with us&#8212;a besot-
ted fool&#8212;but I never said a word to Mary,
for I knew it would grieve her. Things
went on much as before, but after a time
I began to find that there was a bit of a
change in Mary herself. She had always
been so trusting and so innocent, but now
she became queer and suspicious, want-
ing to know where I had been and what I
had been doing, and whom my letters were
from, and what I had in my pockets, and
a thousand such follies. Day by day she
grew queerer and more irritable, and we
had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was
fairly puzzled by it all. Sarah avoided me
now, but she and Mary were just insepa-
rable. I can see now how she was plot-
ting and scheming and poisoning my wife&#8217;s
mind against me, but I was such a blind
beetle that I could not understand it at the
time. Then I broke my blue ribbon and be-
gan to drink again, but I think I should not
have done it if Mary had been the same as
ever. She had some reason to be disgusted
with me now, and the gap between us began
to be wider and wider. And then this Alec
Fairbairn chipped in, and things became a
thousand times blacker.
&#8220; &#8216;It was to see Sarah that he came to my
house first, but soon it was to see us, for
he was a man with winning ways, and
he made friends wherever he went. He
was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and
curled, who had seen half the world and
could talk of what he had seen. He was
good company, I won&#8217;t deny it, and he had
wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor
man, so that I think there must have been
</p>
<p>a time when he knew more of the poop than
the forecastle. For a month he was in and
out of my house, and never once did it cross
my mind that harm might come of his soft,
tricky ways. And then at last something
made me suspect, and from that day my
peace was gone forever.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It was only a little thing, too. I had
come into the parlour unexpected, and as
I walked in at the door I saw a light of wel-
come on my wife&#8217;s face. But as she saw
who it was it faded again, and she turned
away with a look of disappointment. That
was enough for me. There was no one but
Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have
mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him
then I should have killed him, for I have
always been like a madman when my tem-
per gets loose. Mary saw the devil&#8217;s light
in my eyes, and she ran forward with her
hands on my sleeve. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Jim, don&#8217;t!&#8221;
says she. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Sarah?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;In
the kitchen,&#8221; says she. &#8220;Sarah,&#8221; says I as
I went in, &#8220;this man Fairbairn is never to
darken my door again.&#8221; &#8220;Why not?&#8221; says
she. &#8220;Because I order it.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; says she,
&#8220;if my friends are not good enough for this
house, then I am not good enough for it ei-
ther.&#8221; &#8220;You can do what you like,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;but if Fairbairn shows his face here again
I&#8217;ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.&#8221;
She was frightened by my face, I think, for
she never answered a word, and the same
evening she left my house.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t know now whether it was
pure devilry on the part of this woman, or
whether she thought that she could turn me
against my wife by encouraging her to mis-
behave. Anyway, she took a house just two
streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fair-
bairn used to stay there, and Mary would
go round to have tea with her sister and
him. How often she went I don&#8217;t know, but
I followed her one day, and as I broke in at
the door Fairbairn got away over the back
garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that
he was. I swore to my wife that I would
kill her if I found her in his company again,
and I led her back with me, sobbing and
trembling, and as white as a piece of paper.
There was no trace of love between us any
longer. I could see that she hated me and
feared me, and when the thought of it drove
me to drink, then she despised me as well.
</p>
<p>773</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, Sarah found that she could not
make a living in Liverpool, so she went
back, as I understand, to live with her sister
in Croydon, and things jogged on much the
same as ever at home. And then came this
week and all the misery and ruin.
&#8220; &#8216;It was in this way. We had gone on the
May Day for a round voyage of seven days,
but a hogshead got loose and started one
of our plates, so that we had to put back
into port for twelve hours. I left the ship
and came home, thinking what a surprise
it would be for my wife, and hoping that
maybe she would be glad to see me so soon.
The thought was in my head as I turned
into my own street, and at that moment a
cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by
the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and
laughing, with never a thought for me as I
stood watching them from the footpath.
&#8220; &#8216;I tell you, and I give you my word for it,
that from that moment I was not my own
master, and it is all like a dim dream when
I look back on it. I had been drinking hard
of late, and the two things together fairly
turned my brain. There&#8217;s something throb-
bing in my head now, like a docker&#8217;s ham-
mer, but that morning I seemed to have all
Niagara whizzing and buzzing in my ears.
&#8220; &#8216;Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after
the cab. I had a heavy oak stick in my hand,
and I tell you I saw red from the first; but
as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a
little to see them without being seen. They
pulled up soon at the railway station. There
was a good crowd round the booking-office,
so I got quite close to them without being
seen. They took tickets for New Brighton.
So did I, but I got in three carriages be-
hind them. When we reached it they walked
along the Parade, and I was never more
than a hundred yards from them. At last
I saw them hire a boat and start for a row,
for it was a very hot day, and they thought,
no doubt, that it would be cooler on the wa-
ter.
&#8220; &#8216;It was just as if they had been given into
my hands. There was a bit of a haze, and
you could not see more than a few hundred
yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled
after them. I could see the blur of their craft,
but they were going nearly as fast as I, and
they must have been a long mile from the
</p>
<p>shore before I caught them up. The haze
was like a curtain all round us, and there
were we three in the middle of it. My God,
shall I ever forget their faces when they saw
who was in the boat that was closing in
upon them? She screamed out. He swore
like a madman and jabbed at me with an
oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes.
I got past it and got one in with my stick
that crushed his head like an egg. I would
have spared her, perhaps, for all my mad-
ness, but she threw her arms round him,
crying out to him, and calling him &#8220;Alec.&#8221;
I struck again, and she lay stretched beside
him. I was like a wild beast then that had
tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by
the Lord, she should have joined them. I
pulled out my knife, and&#8212;well, there! I&#8217;ve
said enough. It gave me a kind of savage
joy when I thought how Sarah would feel
when she had such signs as these of what
her meddling had brought about. Then I
tied the bodies into the boat, stove a plank,
and stood by until they had sunk. I knew
very well that the owner would think that
they had lost their bearings in the haze, and
had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself
up, got back to land, and joined my ship
without a soul having a suspicion of what
had passed. That night I made up the packet
for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it
from Belfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There you have the whole truth of it. You
can hang me, or do what you like with
me, but you cannot punish me as I have
been punished already. I cannot shut my
eyes but I see those two faces staring at
me&#8212;staring at me as they stared when my
boat broke through the haze. I killed them
quick, but they are killing me slow; and if
I have another night of it I shall be either
mad or dead before morning. You won&#8217;t
put me alone into a cell, sir? For pity&#8217;s
sake don&#8217;t, and may you be treated in your
day of agony as you treat me now.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of it, Watson?&#8221; said
Holmes solemnly as he laid down the paper.
&#8220;What object is served by this circle of misery and
violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or
else our universe is ruled by chance, which is un-
thinkable. But what end? There is the great stand-
ing perennial problem to which human reason is
as far from an answer as ever.&#8221;

<p>CHAPTER I.
Part One

<p>W
</p>
<p>ell, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you
have any particular cause for uneasi-
ness, nor do I understand why I, whose
time is of some value, should interfere
</p>
<p>in the matter. I really have other things to engage
me.&#8221; So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back
to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging
and indexing some of his recent material.
</p>
<p>But the landlady had the pertinacity and also
the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine
last year,&#8221; she said&#8212;&#8220;Mr. Fairdale Hobbs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&#8212;a simple matter.&#8221;
&#8220;But he would never cease talking of it&#8212;your
</p>
<p>kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought
light into the darkness. I remembered his words
when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know
you could if you only would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery,
and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindli-
ness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-
brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it,
then. You don&#8217;t object to tobacco, I take it? Thank
you, Watson&#8212;the matches! You are uneasy, as I
understand, because your new lodger remains in
his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless
you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often
would not see me for weeks on end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, sir; but this is different. It fright-
ens me, Mr. Holmes. I can&#8217;t sleep for fright. To
hear his quick step moving here and moving there
from early morning to late at night, and yet never
to catch so much as a glimpse of him&#8212;it&#8217;s more
than I can stand. My husband is as nervous over
it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while
I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What
has he done? Except for the girl, I am all alone in
the house with him, and it&#8217;s more than my nerves
can stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin
fingers upon the woman&#8217;s shoulder. He had an al-
most hypnotic power of soothing when he wished.
The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agi-
tated features smoothed into their usual common-
place. She sat down in the chair which he had
indicated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I take it up I must understand every detail,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Take time to consider. The smallest point
</p>
<p>may be the most essential. You say that the man
came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight&#8217;s
board and lodging?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked my terms, sir. I said fifty shillings a
week. There is a small sitting-room and bedroom,
and all complete, at the top of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll pay you five pounds a week if I
can have it on my own terms.&#8217; I&#8217;m a poor woman,
sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the money
meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note,
and he held it out to me then and there. &#8216;You can
have the same every fortnight for a long time to
come if you keep the terms,&#8217; he said. &#8216;If not, I&#8217;ll
have no more to do with you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were the terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key
of the house. That was all right. Lodgers often
have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely
to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be dis-
turbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing wonderful in that, surely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason.
He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr.
Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon
him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing
up and down, up and down, night, morning, and
noon; but except on that first night he had never
once gone out of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he went out the first night, did he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and returned very late&#8212;
