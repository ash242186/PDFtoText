<p>CHAPTER I.
Part One

<p>W
</p>
<p>ell, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you
have any particular cause for uneasi-
ness, nor do I understand why I, whose
time is of some value, should interfere
</p>
<p>in the matter. I really have other things to engage
me.&#8221; So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back
to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging
and indexing some of his recent material.
</p>
<p>But the landlady had the pertinacity and also
the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine
last year,&#8221; she said&#8212;&#8220;Mr. Fairdale Hobbs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&#8212;a simple matter.&#8221;
&#8220;But he would never cease talking of it&#8212;your
</p>
<p>kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought
light into the darkness. I remembered his words
when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know
you could if you only would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery,
and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindli-
ness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-
brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it,
then. You don&#8217;t object to tobacco, I take it? Thank
you, Watson&#8212;the matches! You are uneasy, as I
understand, because your new lodger remains in
his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless
you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often
would not see me for weeks on end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, sir; but this is different. It fright-
ens me, Mr. Holmes. I can&#8217;t sleep for fright. To
hear his quick step moving here and moving there
from early morning to late at night, and yet never
to catch so much as a glimpse of him&#8212;it&#8217;s more
than I can stand. My husband is as nervous over
it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while
I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What
has he done? Except for the girl, I am all alone in
the house with him, and it&#8217;s more than my nerves
can stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin
fingers upon the woman&#8217;s shoulder. He had an al-
most hypnotic power of soothing when he wished.
The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agi-
tated features smoothed into their usual common-
place. She sat down in the chair which he had
indicated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I take it up I must understand every detail,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Take time to consider. The smallest point
</p>
<p>may be the most essential. You say that the man
came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight&#8217;s
board and lodging?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked my terms, sir. I said fifty shillings a
week. There is a small sitting-room and bedroom,
and all complete, at the top of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll pay you five pounds a week if I
can have it on my own terms.&#8217; I&#8217;m a poor woman,
sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the money
meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note,
and he held it out to me then and there. &#8216;You can
have the same every fortnight for a long time to
come if you keep the terms,&#8217; he said. &#8216;If not, I&#8217;ll
have no more to do with you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were the terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key
of the house. That was all right. Lodgers often
have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely
to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be dis-
turbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing wonderful in that, surely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason.
He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr.
Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon
him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing
up and down, up and down, night, morning, and
noon; but except on that first night he had never
once gone out of the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he went out the first night, did he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and returned very late&#8212;after we were
all in bed. He told me after he had taken the rooms
that he would do so and asked me not to bar the
door. I heard him come up the stair after mid-
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But his meals?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was his particular direction that we should
always, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair,
outside his door. Then he rings again when he has
finished, and we take it down from the same chair.
If he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of
paper and leaves it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prints it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word,
nothing more. Here&#8217;s the one I brought to show
you&#8212;soap. Here&#8217;s another&#8212;match. This is one
he left the first morning&#8212;daily gazette. I leave
that paper with his breakfast every morning.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Red Circle
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Watson,&#8221; said Homes, staring with
great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the
landlady had handed to him, &#8220;this is certainly a
little unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but
why print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not
write? What would it suggest, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he desired to conceal his handwriting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why? What can it matter to him that his
landlady should have a word of his writing? Still,
it may be as you say. Then, again, why such la-
conic messages?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot imagine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It opens a pleasing field for intelligent spec-
ulation. The words are written with a broad-
pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pat-
tern. You will observe that the paper is torn away
at the side here after the printing was done, so that
the &#8216;s&#8217; of &#8216;soap&#8217; is partly gone. Suggestive, Watson,
is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of caution?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. There was evidently some mark,
some thumbprint, something which might give a
clue to the person&#8217;s identity. Now. Mrs. Warren,
you say that the man was of middle size, dark, and
bearded. What age would he be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Youngish, sir&#8212;not over thirty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, can you give me no further indications?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought
he was a foreigner by his accent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he was well dressed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very smartly dressed, sir&#8212;quite the gentle-
man. Dark clothes&#8212;nothing you would note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave no name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And has had no letters or callers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely you or the girl enter his room of a
morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. What
about his luggage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had one big brown bag with him&#8212;nothing
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t seem to have much material to
help us. Do you say nothing has come out of that
room&#8212;absolutely nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The landlady drew an envelope from her bag;
from it she shook out two burnt matches and a
cigarette-end upon the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were on his tray this morning. I brought
them because I had heard that you can read great
things out of small ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;There is nothing here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The matches
</p>
<p>have, of course, been used to light cigarettes. That
is obvious from the shortness of the burnt end.
Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or
cigar. But, dear me! this cigarette stub is cer-
tainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded
and moustached, you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that. I should say that only
</p>
<p>a clean-shaven man could have smoked this. Why,
Watson, even your modest moustache would have
been singed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A holder?&#8221; I suggested.
&#8220;No, no; the end is matted. I suppose there
</p>
<p>could not be two people in your rooms, Mrs. War-
ren?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it
can keep life in one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think we must wait for a little more
material. After all, you have nothing to complain
of. You have received your rent, and he is not a
troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an un-
usual one. He pays you well, and if he chooses
to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours.
We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his pri-
vacy until we have some reason to think that there
is a guilty reason for it. I&#8217;ve taken up the matter,
and I won&#8217;t lose sight of it. Report to me if any-
thing fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if
it should be needed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are certainly some points of interest in
this case, Watson,&#8221; he remarked when the land-
lady had left us. &#8220;It may, of course, be triv-
ial&#8212;individual eccentricity; or it may be very
much deeper than appears on the surface. The first
thing that strike one is the obvious possibility that
the person now in the rooms may be entirely dif-
ferent from the one who engaged them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you think so?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, apart form this cigarette-end, was it not
</p>
<p>suggestive that the only time the lodger went out
was immediately after his taking the rooms? He
came back&#8212;or someone came back&#8212;when all wit-
nesses were out of the way. We have no proof
that the person who came back was the person
who went out. Then, again, the man who took
the rooms spoke English well. This other, however,
prints &#8216;match&#8217; when it should have been &#8216;matches.&#8217;
I can imagine that the word was taken out of a
dictionary, which would give the noun but not the
</p>
<p>780</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Part One
</p>
<p>plural. The laconic style may be to conceal the ab-
sence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there
are good reasons to suspect that there has been a
substitution of lodgers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But for what possible end?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! there lies our problem. There is one
rather obvious line of investigation.&#8221; He took
down the great book in which, day by day, he
filed the agony columns of the various London
journals. &#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said he, turning over the
pages, &#8220;what a chorus of groans, cries, and bleat-
ings! What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But
surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever
was given to a student of the unusual! This per-
son is alone and cannot be approached by letter
without a breach of that absolute secrecy which
is desired. How is any news or any message to
reach him from without? Obviously by adver-
tisement through a newspaper. There seems no
other way, and fortunately we need concern our-
selves with the one paper only. Here are the Daily
Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. &#8216;Lady with a
black boa at Prince&#8217;s Skating Club&#8217;&#8212;that we may
pass. &#8216;Surely Jimmy will not break his mother&#8217;s
heart&#8217;&#8212;that appears to be irrelevant. &#8216;If the lady
who fainted on Brixton bus&#8217;&#8212;she does not inter-
est me. &#8216;Every day my heart longs&#8212;&#8217; Bleat, Wat-
son&#8212;unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more
possible. Listen to this: &#8216;Be patient. Will find
some sure means of communications. Meanwhile,
this column. G.&#8217; That is two days after Mrs. War-
ren&#8217;s lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it
not? The mysterious one could understand En-
glish, even if he could not print it. Let us see
if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we
are&#8212;three days later. &#8216;Am making successful ar-
rangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds
will pass. G.&#8217; Nothing for a week after that. Then
comes something much more definite: &#8216;The path
is clearing. If I find chance signal message remem-
ber code agreed&#8212;One A, two B, and so on. You
will hear soon. G.&#8217; That was in yesterday&#8217;s paper,
and there is nothing in to-day&#8217;s. It&#8217;s all very ap-
propriate to Mrs. Warren&#8217;s lodger. If we wait a lit-
tle, Watson, I don&#8217;t doubt that the affair will grow
more intelligible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it proved; for in the morning I found my
friend standing on the hearthrug with his back to
the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon
his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this, Watson?&#8221; he cried, picking up the
paper from the table. &#8220;&#8217;High red house with white
stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. Af-
ter dusk. G.&#8217; That is definite enough. I think after
</p>
<p>breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of
Mrs. Warren&#8217;s neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren!
what news do you bring us this morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our client had suddenly burst into the room
with an explosive energy which told of some new
and momentous development.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a police matter, Mr. Holmes!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no more of it! He shall pack out of there
with his baggage. I would have gone straight up
and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to
you to take your opinion first. But I&#8217;m at the end
of my patience, and when it comes to knocking my
old man about&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knocking Mr. Warren about?&#8221;
&#8220;Using him roughly, anyway.&#8221;
&#8220;But who used him roughly?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! that&#8217;s what we want to know! It was this
</p>
<p>morning, sir. Mr. Warren is a timekeeper at Mor-
ton and Waylight&#8217;s, in Tottenham Court Road. He
has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this
morning he had not gone ten paces down the road
when two men came up behind him, threw a coat
over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was
beside the curb. They drove him an hour, and then
opened the door and shot him out. He lay in the
roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw
what became of the cab. When he picked himself
up he found he was on Hampstead Heath; so he
took a bus home, and there he lies now on his sofa,
while I came straight round to tell you what had
happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most interesting,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Did he ob-
serve the appearance of these men&#8212;did he hear
them talk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he
was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by
magic. Two a least were in it, and maybe three.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you connect this attack with your
lodger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve lived there fifteen years and no
such happenings ever came before. I&#8217;ve had
enough of him. Money&#8217;s not everything. I&#8217;ll have
him out of my house before the day is done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. I be-
gin to think that this affair may be very much more
important than appeared at first sight. It is clear
now that some danger is threatening your lodger.
It is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait
for him near your door, mistook your husband for
him in the foggy morning light. On discovering
their mistake they released him. What they would
have done had it not been a mistake, we can only
conjecture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>781</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Red Circle
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours,
Mrs. Warren.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that is to be managed, unless
you break in the door. I always hear him unlock it
as I go down the stair after I leave the tray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has to take the tray in. Surely we could
conceal ourselves and see him do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The landlady thought for a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, there&#8217;s the box-room opposite. I
could arrange a looking-glass, maybe, and if you
were behind the door&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;When does he
lunch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About one, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in
time. For the present, Mrs. Warren, good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon
the steps of Mrs. Warren&#8217;s house&#8212;a high, thin,
yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a narrow
thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British
Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of
the street, it commands a view down Howe Street,
with its ore pretentious houses. Holmes pointed
with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential
flats, which projected so that they could not fail to
catch the eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Watson!&#8221; said he. &#8220; &#8216;High red house with
stone facings.&#8217; There is the signal station all right.
We know the place, and we know the code; so
surely our task should be simple. There&#8217;s a &#8216;to
let&#8217; card in that window. It is evidently an empty
flat to which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs.
Warren, what now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it all ready for you. If you will both
come up and leave your boots below on the land-
ing, I&#8217;ll put you there now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an excellent hiding-place which she had
arranged. The mirror was so placed that, seated
in the dark, we could very plainly see the door
opposite. We had hardly settled down in it, and
Mrs. Warren left us, when a distant tinkle an-
nounced that our mysterious neighbour had rung.
Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid
it down upon a chair beside the closed door, and
then, treading heavily, departed. Crouching to-
gether in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes
fixed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady&#8217;s
footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turn-
ing key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands
darted out and lifted the tray form the chair. An in-
stant later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a
glimpse of a dark, beautiful, horrified face glaring
</p>
<p>at the narrow opening of the box-room. Then the
door crashed to, the key turned once more, and
all was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and
together we stole down the stair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will call again in the evening,&#8221; said he to the
expectant landlady. &#8220;I think, Watson, we can dis-
cuss this business better in our own quarters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,&#8221;
said he, speaking from the depths of his easy-chair.
&#8220;There has been a substitution of lodgers. What I
did not foresee is that we should find a woman,
and no ordinary woman, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She saw us.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is
</p>
<p>certain. The general sequence of events is pretty
clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in London
from a very terrible and instant danger. The mea-
sure of that danger is the rigour of their precau-
tions. The man, who has some work which he
must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute
safety while he does it. It is not an easy problem,
but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effec-
tively that her presence was not even known to the
landlady who supplies her with food. The printed
messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her
sex being discovered by her writing. The man can-
not come near the woman, or he will guide their
enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with
her direct, he has recourse to the agony column of
a paper. So far all is clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is at the root of it?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, yes, Watson&#8212;severely practical, as usual!
</p>
<p>What is at the root of it all? Mrs. Warren&#8217;s whim-
sical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a
more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much
we can say: that it is no ordinary love escapade.
You saw the woman&#8217;s face at the sign of danger.
We have heard, too, of the attack upon the land-
lord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger.
These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy,
argue that the matter is one of life or death. The
attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the en-
emy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware
of the substitution of the female lodger for the
male. It is very curious and complex, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you go further in it? What have
you to gain from it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, indeed? It is art for art&#8217;s sake, Watson.
I suppose when you doctored you found yourself
studying cases without thought of a fee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For my education, Holmes.&#8221;
&#8220;Education never ends, Watson. It is a series
</p>
<p>of lessons with the greatest for the last. This is an
</p>
<p>782</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Part Two
</p>
<p>instructive case. There is neither money nor credit
in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When
dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage
advanced in our investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we returned to Mrs. Warren&#8217;s rooms, the
gloom of a London winter evening had thickened
into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour,
broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the
windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps.
As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of
the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered
high up through the obscurity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone is moving in that room,&#8221; said
Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face
thrust forward to the window-pane. &#8220;Yes, I can
see his shadow. There he is again! He has a
candle in his hand. Now he is peering across.
He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout.
Now he begins to flash. Take the message also,
Watson, that we may check each other. A single
flash&#8212;that is A, surely. Now, then. How many
did you make it? Twenty. Do did In. That should
mean T. AT&#8212;that&#8217;s intelligible enough. Another
T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word.
Now, then&#8212;TENTA. Dead stop. That can&#8217;t be all,
Watson? ATTENTA gives no sense. Nor is it any
better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A.
are a person&#8217;s initials. There it goes again! What&#8217;s
that? ATTE&#8212;why, it is the same message over
again. Curious, Watson, very curious. Now he
is off once more! AT&#8212;why he is repeating it for
the third time. ATTENTA three times! How often
will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish.
He has withdrawn form the window. What do you
make of it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cipher message, Holmes.&#8221;
My companion gave a sudden chuckle of com-
</p>
<p>prehension. &#8220;And not a very obscure cipher, Wat-
</p>
<p>son,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, of course, it is Italian! The A
means that it is addressed to a woman. &#8216;Beware!
Beware! Beware!&#8217; How&#8217;s that, Watson?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you have hit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message,
thrice repeated to make it more so. But beware of
what? Wait a bit, he is coming to the window once
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouch-
ing man and the whisk of the small flame across
the window as the signals were renewed. They
came more rapidly than before&#8212;so rapid that it
was hard to follow them.
