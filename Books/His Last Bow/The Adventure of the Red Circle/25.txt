</p>
<p>instructive case. There is neither money nor credit
in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When
dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage
advanced in our investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we returned to Mrs. Warren&#8217;s rooms, the
gloom of a London winter evening had thickened
into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour,
broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the
windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps.
As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of
the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered
high up through the obscurity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone is moving in that room,&#8221; said
Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face
thrust forward to the window-pane. &#8220;Yes, I can
see his shadow. There he is again! He has a
candle in his hand. Now he is peering across.
He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout.
Now he begins to flash. Take the message also,
Watson, that we may check each other. A single
flash&#8212;that is A, surely. Now, then. How many
did you make it? Twenty. Do did In. That should
mean T. AT&#8212;that&#8217;s intelligible enough. Another
T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word.
Now, then&#8212;TENTA. Dead stop. That can&#8217;t be all,
Watson? ATTENTA gives no sense. Nor is it any
better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A.
are a person&#8217;s initials. There it goes again! What&#8217;s
that? ATTE&#8212;why, it is the same message over
again. Curious, Watson, very curious. Now he
is off once more! AT&#8212;why he is repeating it for
the third time. ATTENTA three times! How often
will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish.
He has withdrawn form the window. What do you
make of it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cipher message, Holmes.&#8221;
My companion gave a sudden chuckle of com-
</p>
<p>prehension. &#8220;And not a very obscure cipher, Wat-
</p>
<p>son,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, of course, it is Italian! The A
means that it is addressed to a woman. &#8216;Beware!
Beware! Beware!&#8217; How&#8217;s that, Watson?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you have hit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message,
thrice repeated to make it more so. But beware of
what? Wait a bit, he is coming to the window once
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouch-
ing man and the whisk of the small flame across
the window as the signals were renewed. They
came more rapidly than before&#8212;so rapid that it
was hard to follow them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;PERICOLO&#8212;pericolo&#8212;eh, what&#8217;s that, Wat-
son? &#8216;Danger,&#8217; isn&#8217;t it? Yes, by Jove, it&#8217;s a danger
signal. There he goes again! PERI. Halloa, what
on earth&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmer-
ing square of window had disappeared, and the
third floor formed a dark band round the lofty
building, with its tiers of shining casements. That
last warning cry had been suddenly cut short.
How, and by whom? The same thought occurred
on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from
where he crouched by the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is serious, Watson,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There is
some devilry going forward! Why should such a
message stop in such a way? I should put Scotland
Yard in touch with this business&#8212;and yet, it is too
pressing for us to leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go for the police?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must define the situation a little more
clearly. It may bear some more innocent interpre-
tation. Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves
and see what we can make of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
Part Two
</p>
<p>As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I
glanced back at the building which we had left.
There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could
see the shadow of a head, a woman&#8217;s head, gazing
tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with
</p>
<p>breathless suspense for the renewal of that inter-
rupted message. At the doorway of the Howe
Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and great-
coat, was leaning against the railing. He started as
the hall-light fell upon our faces.
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Red Circle
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Gregson!&#8221; said my companion as he
shook hands with the Scotland Yard detective.
&#8220;Journeys end with lovers&#8217; meetings. What brings
you here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same reasons that bring you, I expect,&#8221;
said Gregson. &#8220;How you got on to it I can&#8217;t imag-
ine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Different threads, but leading up to the same
tangle. I&#8217;ve been taking the signals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Signals?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, from that window. They broke off in the
middle. We came over to see the reason. But since
it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing
this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit!&#8221; cried Gregson eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do you
this justice, Mr. Holmes, that I was never in a case
yet that I didn&#8217;t feel stronger for having you on my
side. There&#8217;s only the one exit to these flats, so we
have him safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr.
Holmes. You must give us best this time.&#8221; He
struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which
a cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over
from a four-wheeler which stood on the far side
of the street. &#8220;May I introduce you to Mr. Sher-
lock Holmes?&#8221; he said to the cabman. &#8220;This is Mr.
Leverton, of Pinkerton&#8217;s American Agency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;Sir, I am pleased to meet you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The American, a quiet, businesslike young
man, with a clean-shaven, hatchet face, flushed up
at the words of commendation. &#8220;I am on the trail
of my life now, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If I can get
Gorgiano&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well,
we&#8217;ve learned all about him in America. We know
he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we
have nothing positive we can take him on. I
tracked him over from New York, and I&#8217;ve been
close to him for a week in London, waiting some
excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Greg-
son and I ran him to ground in that big tenement
house, and there&#8217;s only one door, so he can&#8217;t slip
us. There&#8217;s three folk come out since he went in,
but I&#8217;ll swear he wasn&#8217;t one of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes talks of signals,&#8221; said Gregson. &#8220;I
expect, as usual, he knows a good deal that we
don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few clear words Holmes explained the sit-
uation as it had appeared to us. The American
struck his hands together with vexation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on to us!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it figures out that way, does it not?
Here he is, sending out messages to an accom-
plice&#8212;there are several of his gang in London.
Then suddenly, just as by your own account he
was telling them that there was danger, he broke
short off. What could it mean except that from the
window he had suddenly either caught sight of us
in the street, or in some way come to understand
how close the danger was, and that he must act
right away if he was to avoid it? What do you sug-
gest, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That we go up at once and see for ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have no warrant for his arrest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in unoccupied premises under suspi-
cious circumstances,&#8221; said Gregson. &#8220;That is good
enough for the moment. When we have him by
the heels we can see if New York can&#8217;t help us to
keep him. I&#8217;ll take the responsibility of arresting
him now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our official detectives may blunder in the mat-
ter of intelligence, but never in that of courage.
Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desper-
ate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and
businesslike bearing with which he would have as-
cended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The
Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but
Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. London
dangers were the privilege of the London force.
</p>
<p>The door of the left-hand flat upon the third
landing was standing ajar. Gregson pushed it
open. Within all was absolute silence and dark-
ness. I struck a match and lit the detective&#8217;s
lantern. As I did so, and as the flicker steadied
into a flame, we all gave a gasp of surprise. On the
deal boards of the carpetless floor there was out-
lined a fresh track of blood. The red steps pointed
towards us and led away from an inner room, the
door of which was closed. Gregson flung it open
and held his light full blaze in front of him, while
we all peered eagerly over his shoulders.
</p>
<p>In the middle of the floor of the empty room
was huddled the figure of an enormous man, his
clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in
its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly
crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle
upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn
up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the
centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there
</p>
<p>784</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Part Two
</p>
<p>projected the white haft of a knife driven blade-
deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man
must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before
that terrific blow. Beside his right hand a most
formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay
upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By George! it&#8217;s Black Gorgiano himself!&#8221; cried
the American detective. &#8220;Someone has got ahead
of us this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the candle in the window, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said Gregson. &#8220;Why, whatever are you
doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle,
and was passing it backward and forward across
the window-panes. Then he peered into the dark-
ness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think that will be helpful,&#8221; said he.
He came over and stood in deep thought while the
two professionals were examining the body. &#8220;You
say that three people came out form the flat while
you were waiting downstairs,&#8221; said he at last. &#8220;Did
you observe them closely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded,
dark, of middle size?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he was the last to pass me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his
description, and we have a very excellent outline
of his footmark. That should be enough for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of
London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to
summon this lady to your aid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We all turned round at the words. There,
framed in the doorway, was a tall and beauti-
ful woman&#8212;the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury.
Slowly she advanced, her face pale and drawn
with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and
staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark
figure on the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have killed him!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;Oh, Dio
mio, you have killed him!&#8221; Then I heard a sudden
sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang into
the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the
room she danced, her hands clapping, her dark
eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a thou-
sand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her
lips. It was terrible and amazing to see such a
woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Sud-
denly she stopped and gazed at us all with a ques-
tioning stare.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you! You are police, are you not? You
have killed Giuseppe Gorgiano. Is it not so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are police, madam.&#8221;
She looked round into the shadows of the
</p>
<p>room.
&#8220;But where, then, is Gennaro?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;He
</p>
<p>is my husband, Gennaro Lucca. I am Emilia Lucca,
and we are both from New York. Where is Gen-
naro? He called me this moment from this win-
dow, and I ran with all my speed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I who called,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;You! How could you call?&#8221;
&#8220;Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your
</p>
<p>presence here was desirable. I knew that I had
only to flash &#8216;Vieni&#8217; and you would surely come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The beautiful Italian looked with awe at my
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand how you know these
things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Giuseppe Gorgiano&#8212;how did
he&#8212;&#8221; She paused, and then suddenly her face lit
up with pride and delight. &#8220;Now I see it! My Gen-
naro! My splendid, beautiful Gennaro, who has
guarded me safe from all harm, he did it, with his
own strong hand he killed the monster! Oh, Gen-
naro, how wonderful you are! What woman could
every be worthy of such a man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Lucca,&#8221; said the prosaic Gregson,
laying his hand upon the lady&#8217;s sleeve with as lit-
tle sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill hooli-
gan, &#8220;I am not very clear yet who you are or what
you are; but you&#8217;ve said enough to make it very
clear that we shall want you at the Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment, Gregson,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I
rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to
give us information as we can be to get it. You
understand, madam, that your husband will be ar-
rested and tried for the death of the man who lies
before us? What you say may be used in evidence.
But if you think that he has acted from motives
which are not criminal, and which he would wish
to have known, then you cannot serve him better
than by telling us the whole story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,&#8221;
said the lady. &#8220;He was a devil and a monster, and
there can be no judge in the world who would
punish my husband for having killed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;my suggestion is
that we lock this door, leave things as we found
them, go with this lady to her room, and form our
opinion after we have heard what it is that she has
to say to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in
the small sitting-room of Signora Lucca, listening
to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events,
</p>
<p>785</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Adventure of the Red Circle
</p>
<p>the ending of which we had chanced to witness.
She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconven-
tional English, which, for the sake of clearness, I
will make grammatical.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;and was the daughter of Augusto Barelli,
who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of
that part. Gennaro was in my father&#8217;s employ-
ment, and I came to love him, as any woman must.
He had neither money nor position&#8212;nothing but
his beauty and strength and energy&#8212;so my father
forbade the match. We fled together, were mar-
ried at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money
which would take us to America. This was four
years ago, and we have been in New York ever
since.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortune was very good to us at first. Gen-
naro was able to do a service to an Italian gen-
tleman&#8212;he saved him from some ruffians in the
place called the Bowery, and so made a power-
ful friend. His name was Tito Castalotte, and
he was the senior partner of the great firm of
Castalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit im-
porters of New York. Signor Zamba is an in-
valid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power
within the firm, which employs more than three
hundred men. He took my husband into his em-
ployment, made him head of a department, and
showed his good-will towards him in every way.
Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that
he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my hus-
band and I loved him as if he were our father. We
had taken and furnished a little house in Brook-
lyn, and our whole future seemed assured when
that black cloud appeared which was soon to over-
spread our sky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One night, when Gennaro returned from his
work, he brought a fellow-countryman back with
him. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come
also from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you
can testify, for you have looked upon his corpse.
Not only was his body that of a giant but every-
thing about him was grotesque, gigantic, and ter-
rifying. His voice was like thunder in our little
house. There was scarce room for the whirl of his
great arms as he talked. His thoughts, his emo-
tions, his passions, all were exaggerated and mon-
strous. He talked, or rather roared, with such en-
ergy that others could but sit and listen, cowed
with the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed
at you and held you at his mercy. He was a terrible
and wonderful man. I thank God that he is dead!
</p>
<p>&#8220;He came again and again. Yet I was aware
that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his
</p>
<p>presence. My poor husband would sit pale and
listless, listening to the endless raving upon poli-
tics and upon social questions which made up or
visitor&#8217;s conversation. Gennaro said nothing, but
I, who knew him so well, could read in his face
some emotion which I had never seen there be-
fore. At first I thought that it was dislike. And
then, gradually, I understood that it was more than
dislike. It was fear&#8212;a deep, secret, shrinking fear.
That night&#8212;the night that I read his terror&#8212;I put
my arms round him and I implored him by his
love for me and by all that he held dear to hold
nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge
man overshadowed him so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me, and my own heart grew cold as
ice as I listened. My poor Gennaro, in his wild and
fiery days, when all the world seemed against him
and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices
of life, had joined a Neapolitan society, the Red
Circle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. The
oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were fright-
ful, but once within its rule no escape was possible.
When we had fled to America Gennaro thought
that he had cast it all off forever. What was his hor-
ror one evening to meet in the streets the very man
who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gor-
giano, a man who had earned the name of &#8216;Death&#8217;
in the south of Italy, for he was red to the elbow
in murder! He had come to New York to avoid
the Italian police, and he had already planted a
branch of this dreadful society in his new home.
All this Gennaro told me and showed me a sum-
mons which he had received that very day, a Red
Circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a
lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that
his presence at it was required and ordered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was bad enough, but worse was to come.
I had noticed for some time that when Gorgiano
came to us, as he constantly did, in the evening,
he spoke much to me; and even when his words
were to my husband those terrible, glaring, wild-
beast eyes of his were always turned upon me.
One night his secret came out. I had awakened
what he called &#8216;love&#8217; within him&#8212;the love of a
brute&#8212;a savage. Gennaro had not yet returned
when he came. He pushed his way in, seized me
in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear&#8217;s em-
brace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to
come away with him. I was struggling and scream-
ing when Gennaro entered and attacked him. He
struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house
which he was never more to enter. It was a deadly
enemy that we made that night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days later came the meeting. Gennaro
returned from it with a face which told me that
</p>
<p>786</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>something dreadful had occurred. It was worse
than we could have imagined possible. The funds
of the society were raised by blackmailing rich Ital-
ians and threatening them with violence should
they refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our
dear friend and benefactor, had been approached.
He had refused to yield to threats, and he had
handed the notices to the police. It was resolved
now that such an example should be made of them
as would prevent any other victim from rebelling.
At the meeting it was arranged that he and his
house should be blown up with dynamite. There
was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out
the deed. Gennaro saw our enemy&#8217;s cruel face
smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag.
No doubt it had been prearranged in some fash-
ion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle
upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon
his palm. He was to kill his best friend, or he was
to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his
comrades. It was part of their fiendish system to
punish those whom they feared or hated by in-
juring not only their own persons but those whom
they loved, and it was the knowledge of this which
hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro&#8217;s head and
drove him nearly crazy with apprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All that night we sat together, our arms round
each other, each strengthening each for the trou-
bles that lay before us. The very next evening had
been fixed for the attempt. By midday my hus-
band and I were on our way to London, but not
before he had given our benefactor full warning
of this danger, and had also left such information
for the police as would safeguard his life for the
future.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves.
We were sure that our enemies would be behind us
like our own shadows. Gorgiano had his private
reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew
how ruthless, cunning, and untiring he could be.
Both Italy and America are full of stories of his
</p>
<p>dreadful powers. If ever they were exerted it
would be now. My darling made use of the few
clear days which our start had given us in arrang-
ing for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no
possible danger could reach me. For his own part,
he wished to be free that he might communicate
both with the American and with the Italian police.
I do not myself know where he lived, or how. All
that I learned was through the columns of a news-
paper. But once as I looked through my window, I
saw two Italians watching the house, and I under-
stood that in some way Gorgiano had found our
retreat. Finally Gennaro told me, through the pa-
per, that he would signal to me from a certain win-
dow, but when the signals came they were nothing
but warnings, which were suddenly interrupted. It
is very clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano to
be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was
ready for him when he came. And now, gentle-
man, I would ask you whether we have anything
to fear from the law, or whether any judge upon
earth would condemn my Gennaro for what he has
done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Gregson,&#8221; said the American, look-
ing across at the official, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what your
British point of view may be, but I guess that in
New York this lady&#8217;s husband will receive a pretty
