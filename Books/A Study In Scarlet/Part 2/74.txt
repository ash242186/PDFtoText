</p>
<p>but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the
man who had won her affections.
</p>
<p>It was a summer evening when he came gallop-
ing down the road and pulled up at the gate. She
was at the doorway, and came down to meet him.
He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up
the pathway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am off, Lucy,&#8221; he said, taking her two hands
in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; &#8220;I
won&#8217;t ask you to come with me now, but will you
be ready to come when I am here again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when will that be?&#8221; she asked, blushing
and laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of months at the outside. I will come
and claim you then, my darling. There&#8217;s no one
who can stand between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how about father?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has given his consent, provided we get
these mines working all right. I have no fear on
that head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well; of course, if you and father have ar-
ranged it all, there&#8217;s no more to be said,&#8221; she whis-
pered, with her cheek against his broad breast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he said, hoarsely, stooping and
kissing her. &#8220;It is settled, then. The longer I stay,
the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me
at the can&#732;on. Good-bye, my own darling&#8212;good-
bye. In two months you shall see me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He tore himself from her as he spoke, and,
flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously
away, never even looking round, as though afraid
that his resolution might fail him if he took one
glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the
gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her
sight. Then she walked back into the house, the
happiest girl in all Utah.

<p>CHAPTER III.
John Ferrier Talks With The Prophet
</p>
<p>Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope
and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake
City. John Ferrier&#8217;s heart was sore within him
when he thought of the young man&#8217;s return, and
of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet
her bright and happy face reconciled him to the
arrangement more than any argument could have
done. He had always determined, deep down in
his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce
him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such
a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as
a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think
of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he
was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the
subject, however, for to express an unorthodox
opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in
the Land of the Saints.
</p>
<p>Yes, a dangerous matter&#8212;so dangerous that
even the most saintly dared only whisper their re-
ligious opinions with bated breath, lest something
which fell from their lips might be misconstrued,
and bring down a swift retribution upon them.
The victims of persecution had now turned per-
secutors on their own account, and persecutors of
</p>
<p>the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition
of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the
Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a
more formidable machinery in motion than that
which cast a cloud over the State of Utah.
</p>
<p>Its invisibility, and the mystery which was at-
tached to it, made this organization doubly terri-
ble. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent,
and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who
held out against the Church vanished away, and
none knew whither he had gone or what had be-
fallen him. His wife and his children awaited him
at home, but no father ever returned to tell them
how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges.
A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihi-
lation, and yet none knew what the nature might
be of this terrible power which was suspended
over them. No wonder that men went about in
fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of
the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts
which oppressed them.
</p>
<p>At first this vague and terrible power was ex-
ercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having
embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>John Ferrier Talks With The Prophet
</p>
<p>to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it
took a wider range. The supply of adult women
was running short, and polygamy without a fe-
male population on which to draw was a bar-
ren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to
be bandied about&#8212;rumours of murdered immi-
grants and rifled camps in regions where Indians
had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in
the harems of the Elders&#8212;women who pined and
wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an un-
extinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the
mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,
stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in
the darkness. These tales and rumours took sub-
stance and shape, and were corroborated and re-
corroborated, until they resolved themselves into
a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches
of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the
Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened
one.
</p>
<p>Fuller knowledge of the organization which
produced such terrible results served to increase
rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired
in the minds of men. None knew who belonged
to this ruthless society. The names of the partic-
ipators in the deeds of blood and violence done
under the name of religion were kept profoundly
secret. The very friend to whom you communi-
cated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his
mission, might be one of those who would come
forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible
reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour,
and none spoke of the things which were nearest
his heart.
</p>
<p>One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set
out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of
the latch, and, looking through the window, saw
a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming
up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for
this was none other than the great Brigham Young
himself. Full of trepidation&#8212;for he knew that such
a visit boded him little good&#8212;Ferrier ran to the
door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, how-
ever, received his salutations coldly, and followed
him with a stern face into the sitting-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Ferrier,&#8221; he said, taking a seat, and
eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-
coloured eyelashes, &#8220;the true believers have been
good friends to you. We picked you up when you
were starving in the desert, we shared our food
with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave
you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to
wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so,&#8221; answered John Ferrier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In return for all this we asked but one condi-
tion: that was, that you should embrace the true
faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This
you promised to do, and this, if common report
says truly, you have neglected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how have I neglected it?&#8221; asked Ferrier,
throwing out his hands in expostulation. &#8220;Have
I not given to the common fund? Have I not at-
tended at the Temple? Have I not&#8212;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your wives?&#8221; asked Young, looking
round him. &#8220;Call them in, that I may greet them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that I have not married,&#8221; Ferrier an-
swered. &#8220;But women were few, and there were
many who had better claims than I. I was not a
lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my
wants.&#8221;
