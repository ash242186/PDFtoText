<p>CHAPTER V.
The Avenging Angels
</p>
<p>All night their course lay through intricate
defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths.
More than once they lost their way, but Hope&#8217;s in-
timate knowledge of the mountains enabled them
to regain the track once more. When morning
broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty
lay before them. In every direction the great snow-
capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each
other&#8217;s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were
the rocky banks on either side of them, that the
larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over
their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to
come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the
fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was
thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had
fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,
a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse
rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges,
and startled the weary horses into a gallop.
</p>
<p>As the sun rose slowly above the eastern hori-
zon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one
after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they
were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent
spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives
and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent
which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and
watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty
breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have
rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable.
&#8220;They will be upon our track by this time,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe
in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our
lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the whole of that day they struggled
on through the defiles, and by evening they calcu-
lated that they were more than thirty miles from
their enemies. At night-time they chose the base
of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some
protection from the chill wind, and there huddled
together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours&#8217;
sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and
on their way once more. They had seen no signs
of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think
that they were fairly out of the reach of the terri-
ble organization whose enmity they had incurred.
He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach,
or how soon it was to close upon them and crush
them.
</p>
<p>About the middle of the second day of their
flight their scanty store of provisions began to run
</p>
<p>out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, how-
ever, for there was game to be had among the
mountains, and he had frequently before had to
depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choos-
ing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few
dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which
his companions might warm themselves, for they
were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea
level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having teth-
ered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw
his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of
whatever chance might throw in his way. Look-
ing back he saw the old man and the young girl
crouching over the blazing fire, while the three an-
imals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then
the intervening rocks hid them from his view.
</p>
<p>He walked for a couple of miles through one
ravine after another without success, though from
the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other
indications, he judged that there were numerous
bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three
hours&#8217; fruitless search, he was thinking of turning
back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he
saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through
his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three
or four hundred feet above him, there stood a crea-
ture somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance,
but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-
horn&#8212;for so it is called&#8212;was acting, probably, as
a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the
hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the oppo-
site direction, and had not perceived him. Lying
on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and
took a long and steady aim before drawing the
trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered
for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and
then came crashing down into the valley beneath.
</p>
<p>The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the
hunter contented himself with cutting away one
haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy
over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps,
for the evening was already drawing in. He had
hardly started, however, before he realized the dif-
ficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had
wandered far past the ravines which were known
to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the
path which he had taken. The valley in which he
found himself divided and sub-divided into many
gorges, which were so like each other that it was
impossible to distinguish one from the other. He
followed one for a mile or more until he came to
</p>
<p>51</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had
never seen before. Convinced that he had taken
the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the
same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and
it was almost dark before he at last found him-
self in a defile which was familiar to him. Even
then it was no easy matter to keep to the right
track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high
cliffs on either side made the obscurity more pro-
found. Weighed down with his burden, and weary
from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up
his heart by the reflection that every step brought
him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him
enough to ensure them food for the remainder of
their journey.
</p>
<p>He had now come to the mouth of the very
defile in which he had left them. Even in the dark-
ness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs
which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be
awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent
nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he
put his hands to his mouth and made the glen
re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was
coming. He paused and listened for an answer.
None came save his own cry, which clattered up
the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to
his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted,
even louder than before, and again no whisper
came back from the friends whom he had left
such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread
came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically,
dropping the precious food in his agitation.
</p>
<p>When he turned the corner, he came full in
sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There
was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it
had evidently not been tended since his departure.
The same dead silence still reigned all round. With
his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on.
There was no living creature near the remains of
the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It
was only too clear that some sudden and terrible
disaster had occurred during his absence&#8212;a disas-
ter which had embraced them all, and yet had left
no traces behind it.
</p>
<p>Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jeffer-
son Hope felt his head spin round, and had to
lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling.
He was essentially a man of action, however, and
speedily recovered from his temporary impotence.
Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the
smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and pro-
ceeded with its help to examine the little camp.
The ground was all stamped down by the feet
of horses, showing that a large party of mounted
</p>
<p>men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction
of their tracks proved that they had afterwards
turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried
back both of his companions with them? Jeffer-
son Hope had almost persuaded himself that they
must have done so, when his eye fell upon an ob-
ject which made every nerve of his body tingle
within him. A little way on one side of the camp
was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had
assuredly not been there before. There was no mis-
taking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As
the young hunter approached it, he perceived that
a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of pa-
per stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription
upon the paper was brief, but to the point:
</p>
<p>JOHN FERRIER,
Formerly of Salt Lake City,
</p>
<p>Died August 4th, 1860.
The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short
a time before, was gone, then, and this was all
his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round
to see if there was a second grave, but there was
no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by
their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny,
by becoming one of the harem of the Elder&#8217;s son.
As the young fellow realized the certainty of her
fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he
wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer
in his last silent resting-place.
</p>
<p>Again, however, his active spirit shook off the
lethargy which springs from despair. If there was
nothing else left to him, he could at least devote
his life to revenge. With indomitable patience
and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a
power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may
have learned from the Indians amongst whom he
had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he
felt that the only one thing which could assuage
his grief would be thorough and complete retri-
bution, brought by his own hand upon his ene-
mies. His strong will and untiring energy should,
he determined, be devoted to that one end. With
a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where
he had dropped the food, and having stirred up
the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last
him for a few days. This he made up into a bun-
dle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk
back through the mountains upon the track of the
avenging angels.
</p>
<p>For five days he toiled footsore and weary
through the defiles which he had already traversed
on horseback. At night he flung himself down
among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of
sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on
his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle
</p>
<p>52</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Avenging Angels
</p>
<p>Can&#732;on, from which they had commenced their ill-
fated flight. Thence he could look down upon
the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he
leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand
fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him.
As he looked at it, he observed that there were
flags in some of the principal streets, and other
signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to
what this might mean when he heard the clatter
of horse&#8217;s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding
towards him. As he approached, he recognized
him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he
had rendered services at different times. He there-
fore accosted him when he got up to him, with the
object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier&#8217;s fate had
been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Jefferson Hope,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You remem-
ber me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Mormon looked at him with undisguised
astonishment&#8212;indeed, it was difficult to recognize
in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly
white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young
hunter of former days. Having, however, at last,
satisfied himself as to his identity, the man&#8217;s sur-
prise changed to consternation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mad to come here,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is as
much as my own life is worth to be seen talking
with you. There is a warrant against you from the
Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fear them, or their warrant,&#8221; Hope
said, earnestly. &#8220;You must know something of this
matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you
hold dear to answer a few questions. We have al-
ways been friends. For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t refuse to
answer me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the Mormon asked uneasily. &#8220;Be
quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees
eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has become of Lucy Ferrier?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was married yesterday to young Drebber.
Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; said Hope faintly. He was
white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the
stone against which he had been leaning. &#8220;Mar-
ried, you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Married yesterday&#8212;that&#8217;s what those flags
are for on the Endowment House. There was some
words between young Drebber and young Stanger-
son as to which was to have her. They&#8217;d both been
in the party that followed them, and Stangerson
had shot her father, which seemed to give him the
best claim; but when they argued it out in council,
</p>
<p>Drebber&#8217;s party was the stronger, so the Prophet
gave her over to him. No one won&#8217;t have her very
long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.
She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you
off, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am off,&#8221; said Jefferson Hope, who had
risen from his seat. His face might have been chis-
elled out of marble, so hard and set was its expres-
sion, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he answered; and, slinging his
weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the
gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains
to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them
all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as
himself.
</p>
<p>The prediction of the Mormon was only too
well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death
of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage
into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never
held up her head again, but pined away and died
within a month. Her sottish husband, who had
married her principally for the sake of John Fer-
rier&#8217;s property, did not affect any great grief at his
bereavement; but his other wives mourned over
her, and sat up with her the night before the burial,
as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped
round the bier in the early hours of the morn-
ing, when, to their inexpressible fear and aston-
ishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-
looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments
strode into the room. Without a glance or a word
to the cowering women, he walked up to the white
silent figure which had once contained the pure
soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed
his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then,
snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring
from her finger. &#8220;She shall not be buried in that,&#8221;
he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm
could be raised sprang down the stairs and was
gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that
the watchers might have found it hard to believe it
themselves or persuade other people of it, had it
not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of
gold which marked her as having been a bride had
disappeared.
</p>
<p>For some months Jefferson Hope lingered
among the mountains, leading a strange wild
life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told
in the City of the weird figure which was seen
prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted
the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whis-
tled through Stangerson&#8217;s window and flattened
</p>
<p>53</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On an-
other occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a
great boulder crashed down on him, and he only
escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon
his face. The two young Mormons were not long
in discovering the reason of these attempts upon
their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the
mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their
enemy, but always without success. Then they
adopted the precaution of never going out alone or
after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded.
After a time they were able to relax these mea-
sures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their
opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled
his vindictiveness.
</p>
<p>Far from doing so, it had, if anything, aug-
mented it. The hunter&#8217;s mind was of a hard, un-
yielding nature, and the predominant idea of re-
venge had taken such complete possession of it
that there was no room for any other emotion. He
was, however, above all things practical. He soon
realized that even his iron constitution could not
stand the incessant strain which he was putting
upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food
were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among
the mountains, what was to become of his revenge
then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake
him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play
his enemy&#8217;s game, so he reluctantly returned to the
old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and
to amass money enough to allow him to pursue
his object without privation.
</p>
<p>His intention had been to be absent a year at
the most, but a combination of unforeseen circum-
stances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly
five. At the end of that time, however, his memory
of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were
quite as keen as on that memorable night when
he had stood by John Ferrier&#8217;s grave. Disguised,
and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt
Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as
long as he obtained what he knew to be justice.
There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There
had been a schism among the Chosen People a few
months before, some of the younger members of
the Church having rebelled against the authority
of the Elders, and the result had been the secession
of a certain number of the malcontents, who had
left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had
been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew
whither they had gone. Rumour reported that
Drebber had managed to convert a large part of
</p>
<p>his property into money, and that he had departed
a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson,
was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,
however, as to their whereabouts.
</p>
<p>Many a man, however vindictive, would have
abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of
such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered
for a moment. With the small competence he pos-
sessed, eked out by such employment as he could
pick up, he travelled from town to town through
the United States in quest of his enemies. Year
passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled,
but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound,
with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon
which he had devoted his life. At last his per-
severance was rewarded. It was but a glance of
a face in a window, but that one glance told him
that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom
he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miser-
able lodgings with his plan of vengeance all ar-
ranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, look-
ing from his window, had recognized the vagrant
in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He
hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied
by Stangerson, who had become his private secre-
tary, and represented to him that they were in dan-
ger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an
old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken
into custody, and not being able to find sureties,
was detained for some weeks. When at last he was
liberated, it was only to find that Drebber&#8217;s house
was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
departed for Europe.
</p>
<p>Again the avenger had been foiled, and again
his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the
pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for
some time he had to return to work, saving every
dollar for his approaching journey. At last, hav-
ing collected enough to keep life in him, he de-
parted for Europe, and tracked his enemies from
city to city, working his way in any menial capac-
ity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he
reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;
and when he followed them there he learned that
they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Dan-
ish capital he was again a few days late, for they
had journeyed on to London, where he at last suc-
ceeded in running them to earth. As to what oc-
curred there, we cannot do better than quote the
old hunter&#8217;s own account, as duly recorded in Dr.
Watson&#8217;s Journal, to which we are already under
such obligations.

<p>CHAPTER VI.
A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.
</p>
<p>Our prisoner&#8217;s furious resistance did not
apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition
towards ourselves, for on finding himself power-
less, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed
his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the
scuffle. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re going to take me to the
police-station,&#8221; he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
&#8220;My cab&#8217;s at the door. If you&#8217;ll loose my legs I&#8217;ll
walk down to it. I&#8217;m not so light to lift as I used to
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if
they thought this proposition rather a bold one;
but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word,
and loosened the towel which we had bound
round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as
though to assure himself that they were free once
more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I
eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more power-
fully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore
an expression of determination and energy which
was as formidable as his personal strength.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a vacant place for a chief of the po-
lice, I reckon you are the man for it,&#8221; he said,
gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-
lodger. &#8220;The way you kept on my trail was a cau-
tion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better come with me,&#8221; said Holmes
to the two detectives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can drive you,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! and Gregson can come inside with me.
You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the
case and may as well stick to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I assented gladly, and we all descended to-
gether. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape,
but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the
box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a
very short time to our destination. We were ush-
ered into a small chamber where a police Inspector
noted down our prisoner&#8217;s name and the names of
the men with whose murder he had been charged.
The official was a white-faced unemotional man,
who went through his duties in a dull mechanical
way. &#8220;The prisoner will be put before the mag-
istrates in the course of the week,&#8221; he said; &#8220;in
the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you any-
thing that you wish to say? I must warn you that
your words will be taken down, and may be used
against you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a good deal to say,&#8221; our prisoner said
slowly. &#8220;I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better reserve that for your trial?&#8221;
asked the Inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may never be tried,&
