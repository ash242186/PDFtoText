</p>
<p>was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking
that I might have dropped it when I stooped over
Drebber&#8217;s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab
in a side street, I went boldly up to the house&#8212;for
I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the
ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into
the arms of a police-officer who was coming out,
and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pre-
tending to be hopelessly drunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end.
All I had to do then was to do as much for Stanger-
son, and so pay off John Ferrier&#8217;s debt. I knew that
he was staying at Halliday&#8217;s Private Hotel, and I
hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy
that he suspected something when Drebber failed
to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was
Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought
he could keep me off by staying indoors he was
very much mistaken. I soon found out which was
the window of his bedroom, and early next morn-
ing I took advantage of some ladders which were
lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my
way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke
him up and told him that the hour had come when
he was to answer for the life he had taken so long
before. I described Drebber&#8217;s death to him, and
I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills.
Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which
that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew
at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the
heart. It would have been the same in any case, for
Providence would never have allowed his guilty
hand to pick out anything but the poison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have little more to say, and it&#8217;s as well, for
I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a
day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save
enough to take me back to America. I was stand-
ing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked
if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope,
</p>
<p>and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman
at 221b, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no
harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man
here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly
snackled as ever I saw in my life. That&#8217;s the whole
of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to
be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much
an officer of justice as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So thrilling had the man&#8217;s narrative been, and
his manner was so impressive that we had sat
silent and absorbed. Even the professional detec-
tives, blase as they were in every detail of crime, ap-
peared to be keenly interested in the man&#8217;s story.
When he finished we sat for some minutes in a
stillness which was only broken by the scratch-
ing of Lestrade&#8217;s pencil as he gave the finishing
touches to his shorthand account.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one point on which I should like
a little more information,&#8221; Sherlock Holmes said
at last. &#8220;Who was your accomplice who came for
the ring which I advertised?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. &#8220;I
can tell my own secrets,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t get
other people into trouble. I saw your advertise-
ment, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might
be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered
to go and see. I think you&#8217;ll own he did it smartly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of that,&#8221; said Holmes heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; the Inspector remarked
gravely, &#8220;the forms of the law must be complied
with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought
before the magistrates, and your attendance will
be required. Until then I will be responsible for
him.&#8221; He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson
Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my
friend and I made our way out of the Station and
took a cab back to Baker Street.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Conclusion
</p>
<p>We had all been warned to appear before
the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the
Thursday came there was no occasion for our tes-
timony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in
</p>
<p>hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned be-
fore a tribunal where strict justice would be meted
out to him. On the very night after his capture the
aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning

</p>
<p>stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid
smile upon his face, as though he had been able in
his dying moments to look back upon a useful life,
and on work well done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his
death,&#8221; Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over
next evening. &#8220;Where will their grand advertise-
ment be now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that they had very much to do with
his capture,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you do in this world is a matter of no
consequence,&#8221; returned my companion, bitterly.
&#8220;The question is, what can you make people be-
lieve that you have done. Never mind,&#8221; he con-
tinued, more brightly, after a pause. &#8220;I would not
have missed the investigation for anything. There
has been no better case within my recollection.
Simple as it was, there were several most instruc-
tive points about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple!&#8221; I ejaculated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, really, it can hardly be described as oth-
erwise,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my sur-
prise. &#8220;The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that
without any help save a few very ordinary deduc-
tions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal
within three days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have already explained to you that what is
out of the common is usually a guide rather than
a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the
grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That
is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy
one, but people do not practise it much. In the
every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason
forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected.
There are fifty who can reason synthetically for
one who can reason analytically.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that I do not quite follow
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly expected that you would. Let me see
if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you de-
scribe a train of events to them, will tell you what
the result would be. They can put those events to-
gether in their minds, and argue from them that
something will come to pass. There are few peo-
ple, however, who, if you told them a result, would
be able to evolve from their own inner conscious-
ness what the steps were which led up to that re-
sult. This power is what I mean when I talk of
reasoning backwards, or analytically.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this was a case in which you were given
the result and had to find everything else for your-
self. Now let me endeavour to show you the dif-
ferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the be-
ginning. I approached the house, as you know,
on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all
impressions. I naturally began by examining the
roadway, and there, as I have already explained to
you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I as-
certained by inquiry, must have been there during
the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and
not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the
wheels. The ordinary London growler is consider-
ably less wide than a gentleman&#8217;s brougham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the first point gained. I then walked
slowly down the garden path, which happened
to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable
for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to
you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to
my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had
a meaning. There is no branch of detective science
which is so important and so much neglected as
the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always
laid great stress upon it, and much practice has
made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy foot-
marks of the constables, but I saw also the track
of the two men who had first passed through the
garden. It was easy to tell that they had been
before the others, because in places their marks
had been entirely obliterated by the others com-
ing upon the top of them. In this way my second
link was formed, which told me that the noctur-
nal visitors were two in number, one remarkable
for his height (as I calculated from the length of
his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to
judge from the small and elegant impression left
by his boots.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On entering the house this last inference was
confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me.
The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder
there was. There was no wound upon the dead
man&#8217;s person, but the agitated expression upon his
face assured me that he had foreseen his fate be-
fore it came upon him. Men who die from heart
disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any
chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Hav-
ing sniffed the dead man&#8217;s lips I detected a slightly
sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he
had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued
that it had been forced upon him from the hatred
and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of
exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other
hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine
that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible ad-
ministration of poison is by no means a new thing
</p>
<p>60</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Conclusion
</p>
<p>in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa,
and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once
to any toxicologist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now came the great question as to the
reason why. Robbery had not been the object of
the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it poli-
tics, then, or was it a woman? That was the ques-
tion which confronted me. I was inclined from the
first to the latter supposition. Political assassins
are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This
murder had, on the contrary, been done most de-
liberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all
over the room, showing that he had been there all
the time. It must have been a private wrong, and
not a political one, which called for such a method-
ical revenge. When the inscription was discovered
upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to
my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind.
When the ring was found, however, it settled the
question. Clearly the murderer had used it to re-
mind his victim of some dead or absent woman.
It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether
he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as
to any particular point in Mr. Drebber&#8217;s former ca-
reer. He answered, you remember, in the negative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I then proceeded to make a careful examina-
tion of the room, which confirmed me in my opin-
ion as to the murderer&#8217;s height, and furnished me
with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly
cigar and the length of his nails. I had already
come to the conclusion, since there were no signs
of a struggle, that the blood which covered the
floor had burst from the murderer&#8217;s nose in his ex-
citement. I could perceive that the track of blood
coincided with the track of his feet. It is sel-
dom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded,
breaks out in this way through emotion, so I haz-
arded the opinion that the criminal was probably
a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that
I had judged correctly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Having left the house, I proceeded to do what
Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head
of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to
the circumstances connected with the marriage of
Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It
told me that Drebber had already applied for the
protection of the law against an old rival in love,
named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope
was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held
the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that
remained was to secure the murderer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had already determined in my own mind
that the man who had walked into the house with
Drebber, was none other than the man who had
</p>
<p>driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me
that the horse had wandered on in a way which
would have been impossible had there been any-
one in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver
be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is
absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry
out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it
were, of a third person, who was sure to betray
him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog
another through London, what better means could
he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these consid-
erations led me to the irresistible conclusion that
Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys
of the Metropolis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had been one there was no reason to be-
lieve that he had ceased to be. On the contrary,
from his point of view, any sudden chance would
be likely to draw attention to himself. He would,
probably, for a time at least, continue to perform
his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he
was going under an assumed name. Why should
he change his name in a country where no one
knew his original one? I therefore organized my
Street Arab detective corps, and sent them sys-
tematically to every cab proprietor in London un-
til they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How
well they succeeded, and how quickly I took ad-
vantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection.
The murder of Stangerson was an incident which
was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly
in any case have been prevented. Through it, as
you know, I came into possession of the pills, the
existence of which I had already surmised. You
see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences
without a break or flaw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Your merits should
be publicly recognized. You should publish an ac-
count of the case. If you won&#8217;t, I will for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do what you like, Doctor,&#8221; he an-
swered. &#8220;See here!&#8221; he continued, handing a paper
over to me, &#8220;look at this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph
to which he pointed was devoted to the case in
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The public,&#8221; it said, &#8220;have lost a sensational
treat through the sudden death of the man Hope,
who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch
Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The de-
tails of the case will probably be never known now,
though we are informed upon good authority that
the crime was the result of an old standing and ro-
mantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore
a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in
their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and
Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt
</p>
<p>61</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at
least, brings out in the most striking manner the
efficiency of our detective police force, and will
serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will
do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not
to carry them on to British soil. It is an open se-
cret that the credit of this smart capture belongs
entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials,
Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.
