<p>CHAPTER VI.
A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.
</p>
<p>Our prisoner&#8217;s furious resistance did not
apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition
towards ourselves, for on finding himself power-
less, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed
his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the
scuffle. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re going to take me to the
police-station,&#8221; he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
&#8220;My cab&#8217;s at the door. If you&#8217;ll loose my legs I&#8217;ll
walk down to it. I&#8217;m not so light to lift as I used to
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if
they thought this proposition rather a bold one;
but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word,
and loosened the towel which we had bound
round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as
though to assure himself that they were free once
more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I
eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more power-
fully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore
an expression of determination and energy which
was as formidable as his personal strength.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a vacant place for a chief of the po-
lice, I reckon you are the man for it,&#8221; he said,
gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-
lodger. &#8220;The way you kept on my trail was a cau-
tion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better come with me,&#8221; said Holmes
to the two detectives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can drive you,&#8221; said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! and Gregson can come inside with me.
You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the
case and may as well stick to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I assented gladly, and we all descended to-
gether. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape,
but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the
box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a
very short time to our destination. We were ush-
ered into a small chamber where a police Inspector
noted down our prisoner&#8217;s name and the names of
the men with whose murder he had been charged.
The official was a white-faced unemotional man,
who went through his duties in a dull mechanical
way. &#8220;The prisoner will be put before the mag-
istrates in the course of the week,&#8221; he said; &#8220;in
the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you any-
thing that you wish to say? I must warn you that
your words will be taken down, and may be used
against you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a good deal to say,&#8221; our prisoner said
slowly. &#8220;I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better reserve that for your trial?&#8221;
asked the Inspector.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may never be tried,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t look startled. It isn&#8217;t suicide I am think-
ing of. Are you a Doctor?&#8221; He turned his fierce
dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Then put your hand here,&#8221; he said, with a
</p>
<p>smile, motioning with his manacled wrists to-
wards his chest.
</p>
<p>I did so; and became at once conscious of an ex-
traordinary throbbing and commotion which was
going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to
thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside
when some powerful engine was at work. In the
silence of the room I could hear a dull humming
and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same
source.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;you have an aortic aneurism!&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s what they call it,&#8221; he said, placidly. &#8220;I
</p>
<p>went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me
that it is bound to burst before many days passed.
It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt
Lake Mountains. I&#8217;ve done my work now, and I
don&#8217;t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave
some account of the business behind me. I don&#8217;t
want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Inspector and the two detectives had a hur-
ried discussion as to the advisability of allowing
him to tell his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you consider, Doctor, that there is imme-
diate danger?&#8221; the former asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly there is,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;In that case it is clearly our duty, in the in-
</p>
<p>terests of justice, to take his statement,&#8221; said the
Inspector. &#8220;You are at liberty, sir, to give your
account, which I again warn you will be taken
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit down, with your leave,&#8221; the pris-
oner said, suiting the action to the word. &#8220;This
aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the
tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended
matters. I&#8217;m on the brink of the grave, and I am
not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the ab-
solute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
consequence to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>55</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back
in his chair and began the following remarkable
statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
manner, as though the events which he narrated
were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the
accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had
access to Lestrade&#8217;s note-book, in which the pris-
oner&#8217;s words were taken down exactly as they
were uttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t much matter to you why I hated these
men,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it&#8217;s enough that they were guilty
of the death of two human beings&#8212;a father and a
daughter&#8212;and that they had, therefore, forfeited
their own lives. After the lapse of time that has
passed since their crime, it was impossible for me
to secure a conviction against them in any court. I
knew of their guilt though, and I determined that
I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled
into one. You&#8217;d have done the same, if you have
any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl that I spoke of was to have married
me twenty years ago. She was forced into marry-
ing that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it.
I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and
I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that
very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of
the crime for which he was punished. I have car-
ried it about with me, and have followed him and
his accomplice over two continents until I caught
them. They thought to tire me out, but they could
not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough,
I die knowing that my work in this world is done,
and well done. They have perished, and by my
hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or
to desire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were rich and I was poor, so that it was
no easy matter for me to follow them. When I
got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
found that I must turn my hand to something for
my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me
as walking, so I applied at a cabowner&#8217;s office, and
soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum
a week to the owner, and whatever was over that
I might keep for myself. There was seldom much
over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The
hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon
that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this
city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me
though, and when once I had spotted the principal
hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was some time before I found out where my
two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and in-
quired until at last I dropped across them. They
were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on
</p>
<p>the other side of the river. When once I found
them out I knew that I had them at my mercy.
I had grown my beard, and there was no chance
of their recognizing me. I would dog them and
follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was de-
termined that they should not escape me again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were very near doing it for all that. Go
where they would about London, I was always at
their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab,
and sometimes on foot, but the former was the
best, for then they could not get away from me. It
was only early in the morning or late at night that
I could earn anything, so that I began to get be-
hind hand with my employer. I did not mind that,
however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the
men I wanted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were very cunning, though. They must
have thought that there was some chance of their
being followed, for they would never go out alone,
and never after nightfall. During two weeks I
drove behind them every day, and never once saw
them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half
the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught nap-
ping. I watched them late and early, but never saw
the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged,
for something told me that the hour had almost
come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest
might burst a little too soon and leave my work
undone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, one evening I was driving up and
down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in
which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to
their door. Presently some luggage was brought
out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson fol-
lowed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse
and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at
ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their
quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left
a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to
the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool
train, and the guard answer that one had just gone
and there would not be another for some hours.
Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Dreb-
ber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so
close to them in the bustle that I could hear every
word that passed between them. Drebber said that
he had a little business of his own to do, and that
if the other would wait for him he would soon re-
join him. His companion remonstrated with him,
and reminded him that they had resolved to stick
together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not
catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other
burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was
</p>
<p>56</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.
</p>
<p>nothing more than his paid servant, and that he
must not presume to dictate to him. On that the
Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bar-
gained with him that if he missed the last train he
should rejoin him at Halliday&#8217;s Private Hotel; to
which Drebber answered that he would be back
on the platform before eleven, and made his way
out of the station.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment for which I had waited so long
had at last come. I had my enemies within my
power. Together they could protect each other,
but singly they were at my mercy. I did not
act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans
were already formed. There is no satisfaction in
vengeance unless the offender has time to real-
ize who it is that strikes him, and why retribu-
tion has come upon him. I had my plans arranged
by which I should have the opportunity of making
the man who had wronged me understand that his
old sin had found him out. It chanced that some
days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had
dropped the key of one of them in my carriage.
It was claimed that same evening, and returned;
but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it,
and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this
I had access to at least one spot in this great city
where I could rely upon being free from interrup-
tion. How to get Drebber to that house was the
difficult problem which I had now to solve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He walked down the road and went into one
or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-
hour in the last of them. When he came out he
staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty
well on. There was a hansom just in front of me,
and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the
nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver
the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge
and through miles of streets, until, to my astonish-
ment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in
which he had boarded. I could not imagine what
his intention was in returning there; but I went on
and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from
the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove
away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My
mouth gets dry with the talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I waited for
a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly
there came a noise like people struggling inside
the house. Next moment the door was flung open
and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber,
and the other was a young chap whom I had never
seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar,
</p>
<p>and when they came to the head of the steps he
gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half
across the road. &#8216;You hound,&#8217; he cried, shaking
his stick at him; &#8216;I&#8217;ll teach you to insult an honest
girl!&#8217; He was so hot that I think he would have
thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the
cur staggered away down the road as fast as his
legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner,
and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped
in. &#8216;Drive me to Halliday&#8217;s Private Hotel,&#8217; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart
jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last mo-
ment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along
slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best
to do. I might take him right out into the country,
and there in some deserted lane have my last in-
terview with him. I had almost decided upon this,
when he solved the problem for me. The craze for
drink had seized him again, and he ordered me
to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leav-
ing word that I should wait for him. There he re-
mained until closing time, and when he came out
he was so far gone that I knew the game was in
my own hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t imagine that I intended to kill him in
cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice
if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to
do it. I had long determined that he should have
a show for his life if he chose to take advantage
of it. Among the many billets which I have filled
in America during my wandering life, I was once
janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York
College. One day the professor was lecturing on
poisons, and he showed his students some alka-
loid, as he called it, which he had extracted from
some South American arrow poison, and which
was so powerful that the least grain meant instant
death. I spotted the bottle in which this prepa-
ration was kept, and when they were all gone, I
helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good
dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, sol-
uble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a sim-
ilar pill made without the poison. I determined at
the time that when I had my chance, my gentle-
men should each have a draw out of one of these
boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would
be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than
firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had
always my pill boxes about with me, and the time
had now come when I was to use them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild,
bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents.
Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within&#8212;so
glad that I could have shouted out from pure exul-
tation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for
</p>
<p>57</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years,
and then suddenly found it within your reach, you
would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and
puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands
were trembling, and my temples throbbing with
excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier
and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness
and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in
this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one
on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the
house in the Brixton Road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to
be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I
looked in at the window, I found Drebber all hud-
dled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by
the arm, &#8216;It&#8217;s time to get out,&#8217; I said.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;All right, cabby,&#8217; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he thought we had come to the ho-
tel that he had mentioned, for he got out without
another word, and followed me down the garden.
I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he
was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the
door, I opened it, and led him into the front room.
I give you my word that all the way, the father and
the daughter were walking in front of us.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s infernally dark,&#8217; said he, stamping about.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;We&#8217;ll soon have a light,&#8217; I said, striking a
match and putting it to a wax candle which I had
brought with me. &#8216;Now, Enoch Drebber,&#8217; I contin-
ued, turning to him, and holding the light to my
own face, &#8216;who am I?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes
for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up
in them, and convulse his whole features, which
showed me that he knew me. He staggered back
with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break
out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his
head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the
door and laughed loud and long. I had always
known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had
never hoped for the contentment of soul which
now possessed me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You dog!&#8217; I said; &#8216;I have hunted you from
Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have al-
ways escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings
have come to an end, for either you or I shall never
see to-morrow&#8217;s sun rise.&#8217; He shrunk still further
away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that
he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The
pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers,
and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort
if the blood had not gushed from my nose and re-
lieved me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?&#8217; I
cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his
face. &#8216;Punishment has been slow in coming, but it
has overtaken you at last.&#8217; I saw his coward lips
tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his
life, but he knew well that it was useless.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Would you murder me?&#8217; he stammered.
&#8220; &#8216;There is no murder,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;Who talks
</p>
<p>of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you
upon my poor darling, when you dragged her
from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to
your accursed and shameless harem.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It was not I who killed her father,&#8217; he cried.
&#8220; &#8216;But it was you who broke her innocent heart,&#8217;
</p>
<p>I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. &#8216;Let
the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.
There is death in one and life in the other. I shall
take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice
upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He cowered away with wild cries and prayers
for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his
throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed
the other, and we stood facing one another in si-
lence for a minute or more, waiting to see which
was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever for-
get the look which came over his face when the
first warning pangs told him that the poison was
in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held
Lucy&#8217;s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was
but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid
is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features;
he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered,
and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the
floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed
my hand upon his heart. There was no movement.
He was dead!
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blood had been streaming from my nose,
but I had taken no notice of it. I don&#8217;t know what
it was that put it into my head to write upon the
wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea
of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt
light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a Ger-
man being found in New York with RACHE writ-
ten up above him, and it was argued at the time
in the newspapers that the secret societies must
have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New
Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped
my finger in my own blood and printed it on a
convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down
to my cab and found that there was nobody about,
and that the night was still very wild. I had driven
some distance when I put my hand into the pocket
in which I usually kept Lucy&#8217;s ring, and found that
it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it
</p>
<p>58</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Conclusion
</p>
<p>was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking
that I might have dropped it when I stooped over
Drebber&#8217;s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab
in a side street, I went boldly up to the house&#8212;for
I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the
ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into
the arms of a police-officer who was coming out,
and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pre-
tending to be hopelessly drunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end.
All I had to do then was to do as much for Stanger-
son, and so pay off John Ferrier&#8217;s debt. I knew that
he was staying at Halliday&#8217;s Private Hotel, and I
hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy
that he suspected something when Drebber failed
to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was
Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought
he could keep me off by staying indoors he was
very much mistaken. I soon found out which was
the window of his bedroom, and early next morn-
ing I took advantage of some ladders which were
lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my
way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke
him up and told him that the hour had come when
he was to answer for the life he had taken so long
before. I described Drebber&#8217;s death to him, and
I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills.
Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which
that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew
at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the
heart. It would have been the same in any case, for
Providence would never have allowed his guilty
hand to pick out anything but the poison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have little more to say, and it&#8217;s as well, for
I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a
day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save
enough to take me back to America. I was stand-
ing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked
if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope,
</p>
<p>and
