</p>
<p>I could see her walking feebly along the other side,
while her pursuer dogged her some little distance
behind. &#8220;Either his whole theory is incorrect,&#8221; I
thought to myself, &#8220;or else he will be led now to
the heart of the mystery.&#8221; There was no need for
him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that
sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his
adventure.
</p>
<p>It was close upon nine when he set out. I had
no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly
puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of
Henri Murger&#8217;s Vie de Bohe&#768;me. Ten o&#8217;clock passed,
and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pat-
tered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread
of the landlady passed my door, bound for the
same destination. It was close upon twelve before I
heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant
he entered I saw by his face that he had not been
successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be
struggling for the mastery, until the former sud-
denly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have the Scotland Yarders know it
for the world,&#8221; he cried, dropping into his chair; &#8220;I
have chaffed them so much that they would never
have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh,
because I know that I will be even with them in the
long run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it then?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind telling a story against my-
self. That creature had gone a little way when she
began to limp and show every sign of being foot-
sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a
four-wheeler which was passing. I managed to
be close to her so as to hear the address, but I
need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out
loud enough to be heard at the other side of the
street, &#8216;Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,&#8217;
she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought,
</p>
<p>and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself
behind. That&#8217;s an art which every detective should
be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never
drew rein until we reached the street in question.
I hopped off before we came to the door, and
strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I
saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and
I saw him open the door and stand expectantly.
Nothing came out though. When I reached him
he was groping about frantically in the empty cab,
and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of
oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or
trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some
time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Num-
ber 13 we found that the house belonged to a re-
spectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that
no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had
ever been heard of there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; I cried, in amazement,
&#8220;that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to
get out of the cab while it was in motion, without
either you or the driver seeing her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old woman be damned!&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes, sharply. &#8220;We were the old women to be
so taken in. It must have been a young man, and
an active one, too, besides being an incomparable
actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he
was followed, no doubt, and used this means of
giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are
after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has
friends who are ready to risk something for him.
Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my
advice and turn in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed
his injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the
smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the
night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his
violin, and knew that he was still pondering over
the strange problem which he had set himself to
unravel.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do
</p>
<p>The papers next day were full of the &#8220;Brixton
Mystery,&#8221; as they termed it. Each had a long ac-
count of the affair, and some had leaders upon
</p>
<p>it in addition. There was some information in
them which was new to me. I still retain in my
scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bear-
</p>
<p>25</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>ing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few
of them:&#8212;
</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history
of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which
presented stranger features. The German name of
the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the
sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its
perpetration by political refugees and revolution-
ists. The Socialists had many branches in America,
and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their
unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them.
After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua to-
fana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,
the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus,
and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article con-
cluded by admonishing the Government and ad-
vocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.
</p>
<p>The Standard commented upon the fact that
lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred un-
der a Liberal Administration. They arose from the
unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the con-
sequent weakening of all authority. The deceased
was an American gentleman who had been resid-
ing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had
stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charp-
entier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was
accompanied in his travels by his private secre-
tary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to
their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and de-
parted to Euston Station with the avowed intention
of catching the Liverpool express. They were after-
wards seen together upon the platform. Nothing
more is known of them until Mr. Drebber&#8217;s body
was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in
the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How
he came there, or how he met his fate, are ques-
tions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing
is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We
are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Greg-
son, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the
case, and it is confidently anticipated that these
well-known officers will speedily throw light upon
the matter.
</p>
<p>The Daily News observed that there was no
doubt as to the crime being a political one. The
despotism and hatred of Liberalism which ani-
mated the Continental Governments had had the
effect of driving to our shores a number of men
who might have made excellent citizens were they
not soured by the recollection of all that they had
undergone. Among these men there was a strin-
gent code of honour, any infringement of which
was punished by death. Every effort should be
</p>
<p>made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to as-
certain some particulars of the habits of the de-
ceased. A great step had been gained by the dis-
covery of the address of the house at which he had
boarded&#8212;a result which was entirely due to the
acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland
Yard.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over
together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford
him considerable amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade
and Gregson would be sure to score.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends on how it turns out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bless you, it doesn&#8217;t matter in the least. If
the man is caught, it will be on account of their ex-
ertions; if he escapes, it will be in spite of their exer-
tions. It&#8217;s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever
they do, they will have followers. &#8216;Un sot trouve
toujours un plus sot qui l&#8217;admire.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is this?&#8221; I cried, for at this mo-
ment there came the pattering of many steps in the
hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible ex-
pressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Baker Street division of the detective
police force,&#8221; said my companion, gravely; and as
he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen
of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that
ever I clapped eyes on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tention!&#8221; cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and
the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so
many disreputable statuettes. &#8220;In future you shall
send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of
you must wait in the street. Have you found it,
Wiggins?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, we hain&#8217;t,&#8221; said one of the youths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly expected you would. You must keep
on until you do. Here are your wages.&#8221; He handed
each of them a shilling. &#8220;Now, off you go, and
come back with a better report next time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waved his hand, and they scampered away
downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their
shrill voices next moment in the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more work to be got out of one of
those little beggars than out of a dozen of the
force,&#8221; Holmes remarked. &#8220;The mere sight of
an official-looking person seals men&#8217;s lips. These
youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear ev-
erything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all
they want is organisation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it on this Brixton case that you are employ-
ing them?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>26</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain.
It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going
to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here
is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude
written upon every feature of his face. Bound for
us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a
few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the
stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our
sitting-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he cried, wringing Holmes&#8217;
unresponsive hand, &#8220;congratulate me! I have
made the whole thing as clear as day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my
companion&#8217;s expressive face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you are on the right track?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The right track! Why, sir, we have the man
under lock and key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And his name is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her
Majesty&#8217;s navy,&#8221; cried Gregson, pompously, rub-
bing his fat hands and inflating his chest.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and re-
laxed into a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We are anxious to know how you managed
it. Will you have some whiskey and water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if I do,&#8221; the detective answered.
&#8220;The tremendous exertions which I have gone
through during the last day or two have worn me
out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand,
as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate
that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-
workers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do me too much honour,&#8221; said Holmes,
gravely. &#8220;Let us hear how you arrived at this most
gratifying result.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective seated himself in the arm-chair,
and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then sud-
denly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of
amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fun of it is,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that that fool
Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone
off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after
the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do
with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no
doubt that he has caught him by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The idea tickled Gregson so much that he
laughed until he choked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you get your clue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor
Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first
difficulty which we had to contend with was the
finding of this American&#8217;s antecedents. Some peo-
ple would have waited until their advertisements
were answered, or until parties came forward and
volunteered information. That is not Tobias Greg-
son&#8217;s way of going to work. You remember the hat
beside the dead man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Holmes; &#8220;by John Underwood and
Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea that you noticed that,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Have you been there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; &#8220;you
should never neglect a chance, however small it
may seem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To a great mind, nothing is little,&#8221; remarked
Holmes, sententiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him
if he had sold a hat of that size and description.
He looked over his books, and came on it at once.
He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing
at Charpentier&#8217;s Boarding Establishment, Torquay
Terrace. Thus I got at his address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smart&#8212;very smart!&#8221; murmured Sherlock
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I next called upon Madame Charpentier,&#8221; con-
tinued the detective. &#8220;I found her very pale and
distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too&#8212;an
uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was look-
ing red about the eyes and her lips trembled as
I spoke to her. That didn&#8217;t escape my notice. I
began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right
scent&#8212;a kind of thrill in your nerves. &#8216;Have you
heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder
Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The mother nodded. She didn&#8217;t seem able to
get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt
more than ever that these people knew something
of the matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;At what o&#8217;clock did Mr. Drebber leave your
house for the train?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;At eight o&#8217;clock,&#8217; she said, gulping in her
throat to keep down her agitation. &#8216;His secre-
tary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two
trains&#8212;one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch
the first.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And was that the last which you saw of him?&#8217;
</p>
<p>27</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>&#8220;A terrible change came over the woman&#8217;s face
as I asked the question. Her features turned per-
fectly livid. It was some seconds before she could
get out the single word &#8216;Yes&#8217;&#8212;and when it did
come it was in a husky unnatural tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was silence for a moment, and then the
daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No good can ever come of falsehood,
mother,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Let us be frank with this gen-
tleman. We did see Mr. Drebber again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;God forgive you!&#8217; cried Madame Charpen-
tier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in
her chair. &#8216;You have murdered your brother.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,&#8217;
the girl answered firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You had best tell me all about it now,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides,
you do not know how much we know of it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;On your head be it, Alice!&#8217; cried her mother;
and then, turning to me, &#8216;I will tell you all, sir. Do
not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son
arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand
in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it.
My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the
eyes of others he may appear to be compromised.
That however is surely impossible. His high char-
acter, his profession, his antecedents would all for-
bid it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Your best way is to make a clean breast of the
facts,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;Depend upon it, if your son is
innocent he will be none the worse.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us to-
gether,&#8217; she said, and her daughter withdrew.
&#8216;Now, sir,&#8217; she continued, &#8216;I had no intention of
telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has
disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once de-
cided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting
any particular.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is your wisest course,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three
weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson,
had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed
a &#8220;Copenhagen&#8221; label upon each of their trunks,
showing that that had been their last stopping
place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but
his employer, I am sorry to say, was far other-
wise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in
his ways. The very night of his arrival he became
very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, af-
ter twelve o&#8217;clock in the day he could hardly ever
be said to be sober. His manners towards the
maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.
</p>
<p>Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same atti-
tude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her
more than once in a way which, fortunately, she
is too innocent to understand. On one occasion
he actually seized her in his arms and embraced
her&#8212;an outrage which caused his own secretary
to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But why did you stand all this,&#8217; I asked. &#8216;I
suppose that you can get rid of your boarders
when you wish.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent
question. &#8216;Would to God that I had given him no-
tice on the very day that he came,&#8217; she said. &#8216;But it
was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound
a day each&#8212;fourteen pounds a week, and this is
the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in
the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose
the money. I acted for the best. This last was too
much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on
account of it. That was the reason of his going.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;My heart grew light when I saw him drive
away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell
him anything of all this, for his temper is violent,
and he is passionately fond of his sister. When
I closed the door behind them a load seemed to
be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an
hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned
that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much ex-
cited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced
his way into the room, where I was sitting with
my daughter, and made some incoherent remark
about having missed his train. He then turned to
Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her
that she should fly with him. &#8220;You are of age,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and there is no law to stop you. I have
money enough and to spare. Never mind the old
girl here, but come along with me now straight
away. You shall live like a princess.&#8221; Poor Alice
was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,
but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured
to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at
that moment my son Arthur came into the room.
What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths
and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too
terrified to raise my head. When I did look up
I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing,
with a stick in his hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that fine
fellow will trouble us again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will just
go after him and see what he does with himself.&#8221;
With those words he took his hat and started off
down the street. The next morning we heard of
Mr. Drebber&#8217;s mysterious death.&#8217;
</p>
<p>28</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do
</p>
<p>&#8220;This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier&#8217;s
lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she
spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I
made shorthand notes of all that she said, however,
so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite exciting,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes,
with a yawn. &#8220;What happened next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Mrs. Charpentier paused,&#8221; the detec-
tive continued, &#8220;I saw that the whole case hung
upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a
way which I always found effective with women, I
asked her at what hour her son returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; she answered.
&#8220; &#8216;Not know?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;After you went to bed?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Yes.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;When did you go to bed?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;About eleven.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;So your son was gone at least two hours?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Yes.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Possibly four or five?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;Yes.&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;What was he doing during that time?&#8217;
&#8220; &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; she answered, turning white
</p>
<p>to her very lips.
&#8220;Of course after that there was nothing more to
</p>
<p>be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpen-
tier was, took two officers with me, and arrested
him. When I touched him on the shoulder and
warned him to come quietly with us, he answered
us as bold as brass, &#8216;I suppose you are arresting me
for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel
Drebber,&#8217; he said. We had said nothing to him
about it, so that his alluding to it had a most sus-
picious aspect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;He still carried the heavy stick which the
</p>
<p>mother described him as having with him when
he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your theory, then?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as
</p>
<p>far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh alter-
cation arose between them, in the course of which
</p>
<p>Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit
of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without
