</p>
<p>minutes or more he continued his researches, mea-
suring with the most exact care the distance be-
tween marks which were entirely invisible to me,
and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in
an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place
he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey
dust from the floor, and packed it away in an enve-
lope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word
upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the
most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to
be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass
in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They say that genius is an infinite capacity for
taking pains,&#8221; he remarked with a smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
very bad definition, but it does apply to detective
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregson and Lestrade had watched the
man&#339;uvres of their amateur companion with con-
siderable curiosity and some contempt. They evi-
dently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had be-
gun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes&#8217; smallest ac-
tions were all directed towards some definite and
practical end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of it, sir?&#8221; they both asked.
&#8220;It would be robbing you of the credit of the
</p>
<p>case if I was to presume to help you,&#8221; remarked
my friend. &#8220;You are doing so well now that it
would be a pity for anyone to interfere.&#8221; There was
a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. &#8220;If you
will let me know how your investigations go,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;I shall be happy to give you any help I
can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the
</p>
<p>constable who found the body. Can you give me
his name and address?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade glanced at his note-book. &#8220;John
Rance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is off duty now. You will find
him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took a note of the address.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Doctor,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we shall go
and look him up. I&#8217;ll tell you one thing which may
help you in the case,&#8221; he continued, turning to the
two detectives. &#8220;There has been murder done, and
the murderer was a man. He was more than six
feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet
for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and
smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with
his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn
by a horse with three old shoes and one new one
on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer
had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right
hand were remarkably long. These are only a few
indications, but they may assist you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other
with an incredulous smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this man was murdered, how was it done?&#8221;
asked the former.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poison,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and
strode off. &#8220;One other thing, Lestrade,&#8221; he added,
turning round at the door: &#8220; &#8216;Rache,&#8217; is the Ger-
man for &#8216;revenge;&#8217; so don&#8217;t lose your time looking
for Miss Rachel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With which Parthian shot he walked away,
leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
What John Rance Had To Tell
</p>
<p>It was one o&#8217;clock when we left No. 3, Lau-
riston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the
nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a
long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered
the driver to take us to the address given us by
Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing like first hand evidence,&#8221; he
remarked; &#8220;as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely
made up upon the case, but still we may as well
learn all that is to be learned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You amaze me, Holmes,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Surely you
</p>
<p>are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those
particulars which you gave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no room for a mistake,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;The very first thing which I observed on arriving
there was that a cab had made two ruts with its
wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we
have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels
which left such a deep impression must have been
there during the night. There were the marks of
the horse&#8217;s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which
was far more clearly cut than that of the other
</p>
<p>19</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since
the cab was there after the rain began, and was
not there at any time during the morning&#8212;I have
Gregson&#8217;s word for that&#8212;it follows that it must
have been there during the night, and, therefore,
that it brought those two individuals to the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems simple enough,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but how
about the other man&#8217;s height?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out
of ten, can be told from the length of his stride.
It is a simple calculation enough, though there is
no use my boring you with figures. I had this fel-
low&#8217;s stride both on the clay outside and on the
dust within. Then I had a way of checking my cal-
culation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct
leads him to write about the level of his own eyes.
Now that writing was just over six feet from the
ground. It was child&#8217;s play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And his age?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet
without the smallest effort, he can&#8217;t be quite in
the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a
puddle on the garden walk which he had evi-
dently walked across. Patent-leather boots had
gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.
There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply
applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts
of observation and deduction which I advocated
in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,&#8221; I sug-
gested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The writing on the wall was done with a
man&#8217;s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass al-
lowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly
scratched in doing it, which would not have been
the case if the man&#8217;s nail had been trimmed. I
gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It
was dark in colour and flakey&#8212;such an ash as is
only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a spe-
cial study of cigar ashes&#8212;in fact, I have written a
monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that
I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known
brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in
such details that the skilled detective differs from
the Gregson and Lestrade type.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the florid face?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I
have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask
me that at the present state of the affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I passed my hand over my brow. &#8220;My head
is in a whirl,&#8221; I remarked; &#8220;the more one thinks
of it the more mysterious it grows. How came
</p>
<p>these two men&#8212;if there were two men&#8212;into an
empty house? What has become of the cabman
who drove them? How could one man compel an-
other to take poison? Where did the blood come
from? What was the object of the murderer, since
robbery had no part in it? How came the woman&#8217;s
ring there? Above all, why should the second
man write up the German word RACHE before
decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possi-
ble way of reconciling all these facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My companion smiled approvingly.
&#8220;You sum up the difficulties of the situation
</p>
<p>succinctly and well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is much that
is still obscure, though I have quite made up my
mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade&#8217;s dis-
covery it was simply a blind intended to put the
police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Social-
ism and secret societies. It was not done by a Ger-
man. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat
after the German fashion. Now, a real German in-
variably prints in the Latin character, so that we
may safely say that this was not written by one, but
by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was
simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong chan-
nel. I&#8217;m not going to tell you much more of the
case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit
when once he has explained his trick, and if I show
you too much of my method of working, you will
come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary
individual after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never do that,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;you have
brought detection as near an exact science as it ever
will be brought in this world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My companion flushed up with pleasure at my
words, and the earnest way in which I uttered
them. I had already observed that he was as sen-
sitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl
could be of her beauty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you one other thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Patent-
leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab,
and they walked down the pathway together as
friendly as possible&#8212;arm-in-arm, in all probabil-
ity. When they got inside they walked up and
down the room&#8212;or rather, Patent-leathers stood
still while Square-toes walked up and down. I
could read all that in the dust; and I could read
that as he walked he grew more and more ex-
cited. That is shown by the increased length of his
strides. He was talking all the while, and working
himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy
occurred. I&#8217;ve told you all I know myself now, for
the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have
a good working basis, however, on which to start.
We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle&#8217;s con-
cert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>What John Rance Had To Tell
</p>
<p>This conversation had occurred while our cab
had been threading its way through a long suc-
cession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In
the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver sud-
denly came to a stand. &#8220;That&#8217;s Audley Court in
there,&#8221; he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line
of dead-coloured brick. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find me here when
you come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Audley Court was not an attractive locality.
The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle
paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.
We picked our way among groups of dirty chil-
dren, and through lines of discoloured linen, until
we came to Number 46, the door of which was
decorated with a small slip of brass on which the
name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found
that the constable was in bed, and we were shown
into a little front parlour to await his coming.
</p>
<p>He appeared presently, looking a little irritable
at being disturbed in his slumbers. &#8220;I made my
report at the office,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket
and played with it pensively. &#8220;We thought that we
should like to hear it all from your own lips,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be most happy to tell you anything I
can,&#8221; the constable answered with his eyes upon
the little golden disk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just let us hear it all in your own way as it
occurred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knit-
ted his brows as though determined not to omit
anything in his narrative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell it ye from the beginning,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;My time is from ten at night to six in the morn-
ing. At eleven there was a fight at the &#8216;White
Hart&#8217;; but bar that all was quiet enough on the
beat. At one o&#8217;clock it began to rain, and I met
Harry Murcher&#8212;him who has the Holland Grove
beat&#8212;and we stood together at the corner of Hen-
rietta Street a-talkin&#8217;. Presently&#8212;maybe about two
or a little after&#8212;I thought I would take a look
round and see that all was right down the Brix-
ton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a
soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or
two went past me. I was a strollin&#8217; down, thinkin&#8217;
between ourselves how uncommon handy a four
of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of
a light caught my eye in the window of that same
house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lau-
riston Gardens was empty on account of him that
owns them who won&#8217;t have the drains seed to,
though the very last tenant what lived in one of
</p>
<p>them died o&#8217; typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a
heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and
I suspected as something was wrong. When I got
to the door&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stopped, and then walked back to the gar-
den gate,&#8221; my companion interrupted. &#8220;What did
you do that for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sher-
lock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his
features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s true, sir,&#8221; he said; &#8220;though how
you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see,
when I got up to the door it was so still and so
lonesome, that I thought I&#8217;d be none the worse for
some one with me. I ain&#8217;t afeared of anything on
this side o&#8217; the grave; but I thought that maybe it
was him that died o&#8217; the typhoid inspecting the
drains what killed him. The thought gave me a
kind o&#8217; turn, and I walked back to the gate to see
if I could see Murcher&#8217;s lantern, but there wasn&#8217;t
no sign of him nor of anyone else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no one in the street?&#8221;
&#8220;Not a livin&#8217; soul, sir, nor as much as a dog.
</p>
<p>Then I pulled myself together and went back and
pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,
so I went into the room where the light was a-
burnin&#8217;. There was a candle flickerin&#8217; on the man-
telpiece&#8212;a red wax one&#8212;and by its light I saw&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked
round the room several times, and you knelt down
by the body, and then you walked through and
tried the kitchen door, and then&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened
face and suspicion in his eyes. &#8220;Where was you
hid to see all that?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It seems to me that
you knows a deal more than you should.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laughed and threw his card across the
table to the constable. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get arresting me for
the murder,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am one of the hounds and
not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will an-
swer for that. Go on, though. What did you do
next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rance resumed his seat, without however los-
ing his mystified expression. &#8220;I went back to
the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought
Murcher and two more to the spot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the street empty then?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be
</p>
<p>of any good goes.&#8221;
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
The constable&#8217;s features broadened into a grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but never anyone so cryin&#8217; drunk as that cove. He
was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin&#8217; up ag&#8217;in
</p>
<p>21</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Study In Scarlet
</p>
<p>the railings, and a-singin&#8217; at the pitch o&#8217; his lungs
about Columbine&#8217;s New-fangled Banner, or some
such stuff. He c
