</p>
<p>the deck. It straightened itself into a little black
man&#8212;the smallest I have ever seen&#8212;with a great,
misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishev-
elled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver,
and I whipped out mine at the sight of this sav-
age, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some
sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his
face exposed; but that face was enough to give a
man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features
so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty.
His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre
light, and his thick lips were writhed back from
his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with
a half animal fury.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire if he raises his hand,&#8221; said Holmes, qui-
etly. We were within a boat&#8217;s-length by this time,
and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see
the two of them now as they stood, the white man
with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and
the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and
his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light
of our lantern.
</p>
<p>It was well that we had so clear a view of him.
Even as we looked he plucked out from under
his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a
school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pis-
tols rang out together. He whirled round, threw
up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell
sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of
his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl
of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-
legged man threw himself upon the rudder and
put it hard down, so that his boat made straight
in for the southern bank, while we shot past her
stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were
round after her in an instant, but she was already
nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate
place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide ex-
panse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water
</p>
<p>and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with
a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her
bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.
The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly
sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain
he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he
possibly take either forwards or backwards. He
yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into
the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only
bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky
bank. When we brought our launch alongside he
was so firmly anchored that it was only by throw-
ing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we
were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like
some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths,
father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but
came aboard meekly enough when commanded.
The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast
to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian work-
manship stood upon the deck. This, there could
be no question, was the same that had contained
the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was
no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we
transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As
we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed
our search-light in every direction, but there was
no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark
ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of
that strange visitor to our shores.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Holmes, pointing to the
wooden hatchway. &#8220;We were hardly quick enough
with our pistols.&#8221; There, sure enough, just behind
where we had been standing, stuck one of those
murderous darts which we knew so well. It must
have whizzed between us at the instant that we
fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoul-
ders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned
me sick to think of the horrible death which had
passed so close to us that night.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.
The Great Agra Treasure
</p>
<p>Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the
iron box which he had done so much and waited
so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-
eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles
</p>
<p>all over his mahogany features, which told of a
hard, open-air life. There was a singular promi-
nence about his bearded chin which marked a man
who was not to be easily turned from his purpose.
</p>
<p>103</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his
black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His
face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though
his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him,
as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when
moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed
hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his
breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling
eyes at the box which had been the cause of his
ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more
sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained coun-
tenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of
something like humour in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jonathan Small,&#8221; said Holmes, lighting
a cigar, &#8220;I am sorry that it has come to this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I, sir,&#8221; he answered, frankly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe that I can swing over the job. I give
you my word on the book that I never raised hand
against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound
Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him.
I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had
been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil
with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was
done, and I could not undo it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a cigar,&#8221; said Holmes; &#8220;and you had best
take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet.
How could you expect so small and weak a man
as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and
hold him while you were climbing the rope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to know as much about it as if you
were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find
the room clear. I knew the habits of the house
pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto
usually went down to his supper. I shall make
no secret of the business. The best defence that
I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it
had been the old major I would have swung for
him with a light heart. I would have thought no
more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.
But it&#8217;s cursed hard that I should be lagged over
this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel
whatever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney
Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you
up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true ac-
count of the matter. You must make a clean breast
of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use
to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts
so quickly that the man was dead before ever you
reached the room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in
my life as when I saw him grinning at me with
his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the
window. It fairly shook me, sir. I&#8217;d have half killed
</p>
<p>Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was
how he came to leave his club, and some of his
darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped
to put you on our track; though how you kept on
it is more than I can tell. I don&#8217;t feel no mal-
ice against you for it. But it does seem a queer
thing,&#8221; he added, with a bitter smile, &#8220;that I who
have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of
money should spend the first half of my life build-
ing a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to
spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor.
It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes
upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the
Agra treasure, which never brought anything but
a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him
it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear
and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his
broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin.
&#8220;Quite a family party,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I think I
shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think
we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn&#8217;t
take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say,
Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather
fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All is well that ends well,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;But
I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such
a clipper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith says she is one of the fastest launches
on the river, and that if he had had another man to
help him with the engines we should never have
caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this
Norwood business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither he did,&#8221; cried our prisoner,&#8212;&#8220;not a
word. I chose his launch because I heard that she
was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid him
well, and he was to get something handsome if we
reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend,
outward bound for the Brazils.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that
no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in
catching our men, we are not so quick in condemn-
ing them.&#8221; It was amusing to notice how the conse-
quential Jones was already beginning to give him-
self airs on the strength of the capture. From the
slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s
face, I could see that the speech had not been lost
upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,&#8221; said
Jones, &#8220;and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the
treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am tak-
ing a very grave responsibility upon myself in do-
ing this. It is most irregular; but of course an
agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as
</p>
<p>104</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Great Agra Treasure
</p>
<p>a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since
you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no
doubt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I shall drive.&#8221;
&#8220;It is a pity there is no key, that we may make
</p>
<p>an inventory first. You will have to break it open.
Where is the key, my man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the bottom of the river,&#8221; said Small, shortly.
&#8220;Hum! There was no use your giving this un-
</p>
<p>necessary trouble. We have had work enough al-
ready through you. However, doctor, I need not
warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with
you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us
there, on our way to the station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy
iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my
companion. A quarter of an hour&#8217;s drive brought
us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester&#8217;s. The servant seemed
surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester
was out for the evening, she explained, and likely
to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in
the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went,
box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the
cab.
</p>
<p>She was seated by the open window, dressed
in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a
little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The
soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she
leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her
sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metal-
lic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One
white arm and hand drooped over the side of the
chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an
absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-
fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright
flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale
cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a cab drive up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I thought
that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but
I never dreamed that it might be you. What news
have you brought me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have brought something better than news,&#8221;
said I, putting down the box upon the table and
speaking jovially and boisterously, though my
heart was heavy within me. &#8220;I have brought you
something which is worth all the news in the
world. I have brought you a fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced at iron box. &#8220;Is that the treasure,
then?&#8221; she asked, coolly enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it
is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto&#8217;s. You will
have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of
that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There
</p>
<p>will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it
not glorious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I think that I must have been rather overacting
my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in
my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a
little, and she glanced at me curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have it,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I owe it to you.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;not to me, but to my
</p>
<p>friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the
world, I could never have followed up a clue which
has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we
very nearly lost it at the last moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Wat-
son,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had
seen her last,&#8212;Holmes&#8217;s new method of search,
the discovery of the Aurora, the appearance of
Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
the wild chase down the Thames. She listened
with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of
our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which
had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white
that I feared that she was about to faint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; she said, as I hastened to pour
her out some water. &#8220;I am all right again. It was a
shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends
in such horrible peril.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all over,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It was nothing.
I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn
to something brighter. There is the treasure. What
could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it
with me, thinking that it would interest you to be
the first to see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be of the greatest interest to me,&#8221; she
said. There was no eagerness in her voice, how-
ever. It had struck her, doubtless, that it might
seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to
a prize which had cost so much to win.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pretty box!&#8221; she said, stooping over it.
&#8220;This is Indian work, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it is Benares metal-work.&#8221;
&#8220;And so heavy!&#8221; she exclaimed, trying to raise
</p>
<p>it. &#8220;The box alone must be of some value. Where
is the key?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Small threw it into the Thames,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I must borrow Mrs. Forrester&#8217;s poker.&#8221; There was
in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in
the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust
the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a
lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap.
With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We
both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was
empty!
</p>
<p>105</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work
was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was
massive, well made, and solid, like a chest con-
structed to carry things of great price, but not one
shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It
was absolutely and completely empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure is lost,&#8221; said Miss Morstan,
calmly.
</p>
<p>As
