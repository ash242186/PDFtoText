<p>CHAPTER III.
In Quest of a Solution
</p>
<p>It was half-past five before Holmes returned.
He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,&#8212;a
mood which in his case alternated with fits of the
blackest depression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no great mystery in this matter,&#8221; he
said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out
for him. &#8220;The facts appear to admit of only one
explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! you have solved it already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that would be too much to say. I have
discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, how-
ever, very suggestive. The details are still to be
added. I have just found, on consulting the back
files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Nor-
word, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon
the 28th of April, 1882.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see
what this suggests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way,
then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only per-
son in London whom he could have visited is Ma-
jor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that
he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies.
Within a week of his death Captain Morstan&#8217;s daugh-
ter receives a valuable present, which is repeated
from year to year, and now culminates in a letter
which describes her as a wronged woman. What
wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of
her father? And why should the presents begin
immediately after Sholto&#8217;s death, unless it is that
Sholto&#8217;s heir knows something of the mystery and
desires to make compensation? Have you any al-
ternative theory which will meet the facts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what a strange compensation! And how
strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter
now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter
speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she
have? It is too much to suppose that her father is
still alive. There is no other injustice in her case
that you know of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are difficulties; there are certainly dif-
ficulties,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. &#8220;But
our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah,
here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside.
Are you all ready? Then we had better go down,
for it is a little past the hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but
I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his
drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear
</p>
<p>that he thought that our night&#8217;s work might be a
serious one.
</p>
<p>Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak,
and her sensitive face was composed, but pale.
She must have been more than woman if she
did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enter-
prise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-
control was perfect, and she readily answered the
few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes
put to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Major Sholto was a very particular friend of
papa&#8217;s,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His letters were full of allu-
sions to the major. He and papa were in command
of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were
thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curi-
ous paper was found in papa&#8217;s desk which no one
could understand. I don&#8217;t suppose that it is of the
slightest importance, but I thought you might care
to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and
smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very
methodically examined it all over with his double
lens.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is paper of native Indian manufacture,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;It has at some time been pinned to a
board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of
part of a large building with numerous halls, cor-
ridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross
done in red ink, and above it is &#8216;3.37 from left,&#8217;
in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is
a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line
with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in
very rough and coarse characters, &#8216;The sign of the
four,&#8212;Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah
Khan, Dost Akbar.&#8217; No, I confess that I do not see
how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently
a document of importance. It has been kept care-
fully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean
as the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in his pocket-book that we found it.&#8221;
&#8220;Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for
</p>
<p>it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect
that this matter may turn out to be much deeper
and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must
reconsider my ideas.&#8221; He leaned back in the cab,
and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant
eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan
and I chatted in an undertone about our present
expedition and its possible outcome, but our com-
panion maintained his impenetrable reserve until
the end of our journey.

</p>
<p>It was a September evening, and not yet seven
o&#8217;clock, but the day had been a dreary one,
and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great
city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the
muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were
but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a
feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement.
The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed
out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a
murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thor-
oughfare. There was, to my mind, something
eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of
faces which flitted across these narrow bars of
light,&#8212;sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.
Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom
into the light, and so back into the gloom once
more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull,
heavy evening, with the strange business upon
which we were engaged, combined to make me
nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss
Morstan&#8217;s manner that she was suffering from the
same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to
petty influences. He held his open note-book upon
his knee, and from time to time he jotted down
figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-
lantern.
</p>
<p>At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were al-
ready thick at the side-entrances. In front a
continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers
were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of
shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded
women. We had hardly reached the third pillar,
which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark,
brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the parties who come with Miss
Morstan?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen
are my friends,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and
questioning eyes upon us. &#8220;You will excuse me,
miss,&#8221; he said with a certain dogged manner, &#8220;but
I was to ask you to give me your word that neither
of your companions is a police-officer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you my word on that,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab
led across a four-wheeler and opened the door.
The man who had addressed us mounted to the
box, while we took our places inside. We had
hardly done so before the driver whipped up his
horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace
through the foggy streets.
</p>
<p>The situation was a curious one. We were
driving to an unknown place, on an unknown
</p>
<p>errand. Yet our invitation was either a com-
plete
