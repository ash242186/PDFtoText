</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, with a significant raising of
the eyebrows.
</p>
<p>In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of
horror, &#8220;The sign of the four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, what does it all mean?&#8221; I
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means murder,&#8221; said he, stooping over the
dead man. &#8220;Ah, I expected it. Look here!&#8221; He
pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn
stuck in the skin just above the ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a thorn,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be care-
ful, for it is poisoned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I took it up between my finger and thumb. It
came away from the skin so readily that hardly
any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood
showed where the puncture had been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all an insoluble mystery to me,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;It grows darker instead of clearer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it clears ev-
ery instant. I only require a few missing links to
have an entirely connected case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had almost forgotten our companion&#8217;s pres-
ence since we entered the chamber. He was still
standing in the door-way, the very picture of terror,
</p>
<p>wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Sud-
denly, however, he broke out into a sharp, queru-
lous cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure is gone!&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have
robbed him of the treasure! There is the hole
through which we lowered it. I helped him to do
it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him
here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I
came down-stairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was ten o&#8217;clock. And now he is dead, and
the police will be called in, and I shall be sus-
pected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am
sure I shall. But you don&#8217;t think so, gentlemen?
Surely you don&#8217;t think that it was I? Is it likely
that I would have brought you here if it were I?
Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!&#8221;
He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind
of convulsive frenzy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,&#8221; said
Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoul-
der. &#8220;Take my advice, and drive down to the sta-
tion to report this matter to the police. Offer to
assist them in every way. We shall wait here until
your return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fash-
ion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs
in the dark.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, rubbing his
hands, &#8220;we have half an hour to ourselves. Let
us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told
you, almost complete; but we must not err on the
side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems
now, there may be something deeper underlying
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple!&#8221; I ejaculated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said he, with something of the air of
a clinical professor expounding to his class. &#8220;Just
sit in the corner there, that your footprints may
not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first
place, how did these folk come, and how did they
go? The door has not been opened since last night.
</p>
<p>How of the window?&#8221; He carried the lamp across
to it, muttering his observations aloud the while,
but addressing them to himself rather than to me.
&#8220;Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework
is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No
water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a
man has mounted by the window. It rained a lit-
tle last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould
upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark,
and here again upon the floor, and here again by
the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very
pretty demonstration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I looked at the round, well-defined muddy
discs. &#8220;This is not a footmark,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>82</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is something much more valuable to us. It
is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here
on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the
broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the
timber-toe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the wooden-legged man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. But there has been some one else,&#8212;a
very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that
wall, doctor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I looked out of the open window. The moon
still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We
were a good sixty feet from the round, and, look
where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as
much as a crevice in the brick-work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely impossible,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a
friend up here who lowered you this good stout
rope which I see in the corner, securing one end
of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think,
if you were an active man, you might swarm up,
wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course,
in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up
the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window,
snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that
he originally came. As a minor point it may be
noted,&#8221; he continued, fingering the rope, &#8220;that our
wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was
not a professional sailor. His hands were far from
horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-
mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from
which I gather that he slipped down with such ve-
locity that he took the skin off his hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but the thing be-
comes more unintelligible than ever. How about
this mysterious ally? How came he into the
room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the ally!&#8221; repeated Holmes, pensively.
&#8220;There are features of interest about this ally. He
lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace.
I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the
annals of crime in this country,&#8212;though parallel
cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my
memory serves me, from Senegambia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How came he, then?&#8221; I reiterated. &#8220;The door
is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it
through the chimney?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The grate is much too small,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I
had already considered that possibility.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How then?&#8221; I persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not apply my precept,&#8221; he said, shak-
ing his head. &#8220;How often have I said to you
that when you have eliminated the impossible
</p>
<p>whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth? We know that he did not come through the
door, the window, or the chimney. We also know
that he could not have been concealed in the room,
as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then,
did he come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He came through the hole in the roof,&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Of course he did. He must have done so. If
</p>
<p>you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for
me, we shall now extend our researches to the
room above,&#8212;the secret room in which the trea-
sure was found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter
with either hand, he swung himself up into the
garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down
for the lamp and held it while I followed him.
</p>
<p>The chamber in which we found ourselves was
about ten feet one way and six the other. The
floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-
plaster between, so that in walking one had to step
from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex,
and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof
of the house. There was no furniture of any sort,
and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon
the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, you see,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes,
putting his hand against the sloping wall. &#8220;This is
a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can
press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping
at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which
Number One entered. Let us see if we can find one
other traces of his individuality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he
did so I saw for the second time that night a star-
tled, surprised look come over his face. For my-
self, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under
my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the
prints of a naked foot,&#8212;clear, well defined, per-
fectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of
an ordinary man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes,&#8221; I said, in a whisper, &#8220;a child has
done the horrid thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had recovered his self-possession in an in-
stant. &#8220;I was staggered for the moment,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed
me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There
is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your theory, then, as to those foot-
marks?&#8221; I asked, eagerly, when we had regained
the lower room once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,&#8221;
said he, with a touch of impatience. &#8220;You know
</p>
<p>83</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>my methods. Apply them, and it will be instruc-
tive to compare results.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot conceive anything which will cover
the facts,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be clear enough to you soon,&#8221; he said,
in an off-hand way. &#8220;I think that there is noth-
ing else of importance here, but I will look.&#8221; He
whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hur-
ried about the room on his knees, measuring, com-
paring, examining, with his long thin nose only a
few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes
gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So
swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like
those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,
that I could not but think what a terrible criminal
he would have made had he turned his energy and
sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them
in its defense. As he hunted about, he kept mut-
tering to himself, and finally he broke out into a
loud crow of delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are certainly in luck,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We ought
to have very little trouble now. Number One has
had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You
can see the outline of the edge of his small foot
here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The car-
boy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has
leaked out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Why, we have got him, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
</p>
<p>know a dog that would follow that scent to the
world&#8217;s end. If a pack can track a trailed her-
ring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained
hound follow so pungent a smell as this? It sounds
like a sum in the rule of three. The answer should
give us the&#8212;But halloo! here are the accredited
representatives of the law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were
audible from below, and the hall door shut with a
loud crash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before they come,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;just put
your hand here on this poor fellow&#8217;s arm, and here
on his leg. What do you feel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The muscles are as hard as a board,&#8221; I an-
swered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. They are in a state of extreme con-
traction, far exceeding the usual rigor mortis. Cou-
pled with this distortion of the face, this Hippo-
cratic smile, or &#8216;risus sardonicus,&#8217; as the old writers
called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your
mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Death from some powerful vegetable alka-
loid,&#8221; I answered,&#8212;&#8220;some strychnine-like sub-
stance which would produce tetanus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the idea which occurred to me the
instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On
getting into the room I at once looked for the
means by which the poison had entered the sys-
tem. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had
been driven or shot with no great force into the
scalp. You observe that the part struck was that
which would be turned towards the hole in the
ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now ex-
amine the thorn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of
the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a
glazed look near the point as though some gummy
substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had
been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that an English thorn?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it certainly is not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all these data you should be able to draw
some just inference. But here are the regulars: so
the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, the steps which had been coming
nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very
stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into
the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric,
with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which
looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy
pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector
in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus
Sholto.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a business!&#8221; he cried, in a muffled,
husky voice. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a pretty business! But who
are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full
as a rabbit-warren!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney
Jones,&#8221; said Holmes, quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I do!&#8221; he wheezed. &#8220;It&#8217;s Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I&#8217;ll
never forget how you lectured us all on causes and
inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case.
It&#8217;s true you set us on the right track; but you&#8217;ll
own now that it was more by good luck than good
guidance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a piece of very simple reasoning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to
own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad
business! Stern facts here,&#8212;no room for theories.
How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood
over another case! I was at the station when the
message arrived. What d&#8217;you think the man died
of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize
over,&#8221; said Holmes, dryly.
</p>
<p>84</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. Still, we can&#8217;t deny that you hit the
nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door
locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million
missing. How was the window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could
have nothing to do with the matter. That&#8217;s com-
mon sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then
the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These
flashes come upon me at times.&#8212;Just step outside,
sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can re-
main.&#8212;What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto
was, on his own confession, with his brother last
night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto
walked off with the treasure. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On which the dead man very considerately
got up and locked the door on the inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! There&#8217;s a flaw there. Let us apply com-
mon sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto
was with his brother; there was a quarrel; so much
we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are
gone. So much also we know. No one saw the
brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed
had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in
a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance
is&#8212;well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving
my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close
upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not quite in possession of the facts
yet,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;This splinter of wood, which I
have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in
the man&#8217;s scalp where you still see the mark; this
card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and
beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed in-
strument. How does all that fit into your theory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confirms it in every respect,&#8221; said the fat de-
tective, pompously. &#8220;House is full of Indian cu-
riosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this
splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have
made murderous use of it as any other man. The
card is some hocus-pocus,&#8212;a blind, as like as not.
The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of
course, here is a hole in the roof.&#8221; With great ac-
tivity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps
and squeezed through into the garret, and imme-
diately afterwards we heard his exulting voice pro-
claiming that he had found the trap-door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can find something,&#8221; remarked Holmes,
shrugging his shoulders. &#8220;He has occasional glim-
merings of reason. Il n&#8217;y a pas des sots si incommodes
que ceux qui ont de l&#8217;esprit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see!&#8221; said Athelney Jones, reappearing
down the steps again. &#8220;Facts are better than mere
</p>
<p>theories, after all. My view of the case is con-
firmed. There is a trap-door communicating with
the roof, and it is partly open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I who opened it.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?&#8221; He
</p>
<p>seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. &#8220;Well,
whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman
got away. Inspector!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; from the passage.
&#8220;Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.&#8212;Mr. Sholto, it
</p>
<p>is my duty to inform you that anything which you
may say will be used against you. I arrest you in
the queen&#8217;s name as being concerned in the death
of your brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now! Didn&#8217;t I tell you!&#8221; cried the poor
little man, throwing out his hands, and looking
from one to the other of us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;I think that I can engage to clear
you of the charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,&#8212;don&#8217;t
promise too much!&#8221; snapped the detective. &#8220;You
may find it a harder matter than you think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will
make you a free present of the name and descrip-
tion of one of the two people who were in this
room last night. His name, I have every reason to
believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated
man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wear-
ing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the
inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed
sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a
middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been
a convict. These few indications may be of some
assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there
is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his
hand. The other man&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! the other man&#8212;?&#8221; asked Athelney Jones,
in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less,
as I could easily see, by the precision of the other&#8217;s
manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a rather curious person,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes, turning upon his heel. &#8220;I hope before
very long to be able to introduce you to the pair
of them. A word with you, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led me out to the head of the stair. &#8220;This
unexpected occurrence,&#8220; he said, &#8221;has caused us
rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our
journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just been thinking so,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It
is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in
this stricken house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You must escort her home. She lives with
Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is
</p>
<p>85</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>not very far. I will wait for you here if you will
drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means. I don&#8217;t think I could rest until I
know more of this fantastic business. I have seen
something of the rough side of life, but I give you
my word that this quick succession of strange sur-
prises to-night has shaken my nerve completely.
I should like, however, to see the matter through
with you, now that I have got so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your presence will be of great service to me,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;We shall work the case out inde-
pendently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over
any mare&#8217;s-nest which he may choose to construct.
When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you
to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the
water&#8217;s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the
right-hand side is a bird-stuffer&#8217;s: Sherman is the
name. You will see a weasel holding a young rab-
</p>
<p>bit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and
tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby
at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dog, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8212;a queer mongrel, with a most amazing
power of scent. I would rather have Toby&#8217;s help
than that of the whole detective force of London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall bring him, then,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It is one now.
I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh
horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;shall see what I can
learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian
