<p>CHAPTER I.
The Science of Deduction
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>herlock Holmes took his bottle from
the corner of the mantelpiece and his hy-
podermic syringe from its neat morocco
case. With his long, white, nervous fin-
</p>
<p>gers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled
back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his
eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm
and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumer-
able puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp
point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and
sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a
long sigh of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Three times a day for many months I had wit-
nessed this performance, but custom had not rec-
onciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day
to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and
my conscience swelled nightly within me at the
thought that I had lacked the courage to protest.
Again and again I had registered a vow that I
should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there
was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my com-
panion which made him the last man with whom
one would care to take anything approaching to
a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner,
and the experience which I had had of his many
extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and
backward in crossing him.
</p>
<p>Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the
Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the
additional exasperation produced by the extreme
deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I
could hold out no longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is it to-day?&#8221; I asked,&#8212;&#8220;morphine or
cocaine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He raised his eyes languidly from the old
black-letter volume which he had opened. &#8220;It
is cocaine,&#8221; he said,&#8212;&#8220;a seven-per-cent solution.
Would you care to try it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; I answered, brusquely. &#8220;My con-
stitution has not got over the Afghan campaign
yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled at my vehemence. &#8220;Perhaps you are
right, Watson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suppose that its influ-
ence is physically a bad one. I find it, however,
so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the
mind that its secondary action is a matter of small
moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But consider!&#8221; I said, earnestly. &#8220;Count the
cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and ex-
cited, but it is a pathological and morbid process,
</p>
<p>which involves increased tissue-change and may at
last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too,
what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the
game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you,
for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those
great powers with which you have been endowed?
Remember that I speak not only as one comrade
to another, but as a medical man to one for whose
constitution he is to some extent answerable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he
put his fingertips together and leaned his elbows
on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish
for conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind,&#8221; he said, &#8220;rebels at stagnation. Give
me problems, give me work, give me the most ab-
struse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis,
and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dis-
pense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor
the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental
exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own par-
ticular profession,&#8212;or rather created it, for I am
the only one in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only unofficial detective?&#8221; I said, raising
my eyebrows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only unofficial consulting detective,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;I am the last and highest court of ap-
peal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or
Athelney Jones are out of their depths&#8212;which, by
the way, is their normal state&#8212;the matter is laid
before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and
pronounce a specialist&#8217;s opinion. I claim no credit
in such cases. My name figures in no newspa-
per. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a
field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward.
But you have yourself had some experience of my
methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said I, cordially. &#8220;I was never so
struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it
in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic
title of &#8216;A Study in Scarlet.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook his head sadly. &#8220;I glanced over it,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon
it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science,
and should be treated in the same cold and un-
emotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it
with romanticism, which produces much the same
effect as if you worked a love-story or an elope-
ment into the fifth proposition of Euclid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the romance was there,&#8221; I remonstrated.
&#8220;I could not tamper with the facts.&#8221;
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some facts should be suppressed, or at least
a just sense of proportion should be observed in
treating them. The only point in the case which
deserved mention was the curious analytical rea-
soning from effects to causes by which I succeeded
in unraveling it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which
had been specially designed to please him. I con-
fess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which
seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet
should be devoted to his own special doings. More
than once during the years that I had lived with
him in Baker Street I had observed that a small
vanity underlay my companion&#8217;s quiet and didac-
tic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat
nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet
through it some time before, and, though it did
not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at
every change of the weather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My practice has extended recently to the Con-
tinent,&#8221; said Holmes, after a while, filling up his
old brier-root pipe. &#8220;I was consulted last week by
Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know,
has come rather to the front lately in the French de-
tective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick
intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of
exact knowledge which is essential to the higher
developments of his art. The case was concerned
with a will, and possessed some features of inter-
est. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,
the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis
in 1871, which have suggested to him the true so-
lution. Here is the letter which I had this morning
acknowledging my assistance.&#8221; He tossed over, as
he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I
glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of
notes of admiration, with stray magnifiques, coup-
de-ma&#305;&#770;tres and tours-de-force, all testifying to the ar-
dent admiration of the Frenchman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He speaks as a pupil to his master,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, lightly. &#8220;He has considerable
gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three
qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has
the power of observation and that of deduction.
He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may
come in time. He is now translating my small
works into French.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your works?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221; he cried, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs.
They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for
example, is one &#8216;Upon the Distinction between the
Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.&#8217; In it I enumerate a
</p>
<p>hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and
pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the
difference in the ash. It is a point which is con-
tinually turning up in criminal trials, and which
is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If
you can say definitely, for example, that some mur-
der has been done by a man who was smoking an
Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of
search. To the trained eye there is as much differ-
ence between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and
the white fluff of bird&#8217;s-eye as there is between a
cabbage and a potato.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have an extraordinary genius for minu-
tiae,&#8221; I remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate their importance. Here is my
monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with
some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris
as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a cu-
rious little work upon the influence of a trade
upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the
hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors,
weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a mat-
ter of great practical interest to the scientific detec-
tive,&#8212;especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or
in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I
weary you with my hobby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; I answered, earnestly. &#8220;It is of the
greatest interest to me, especially since I have had
the opportunity of observing your practical appli-
cation of it. But you spoke just now of observation
and deduction. Surely the one to some extent im-
plies the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hardly,&#8221; he answered, leaning back lux-
uriously in his armchair, and sending up thick blue
wreaths from his pipe. &#8220;For example, observa-
tion shows me that you have been to the Wigmore
Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets
me know that when there you dispatched a tele-
gram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; said I. &#8220;Right on both points! But I
confess that I don&#8217;t see how you arrived at it. It
was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have
mentioned it to no one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is simplicity itself,&#8221; he remarked, chuckling
at my surprise,&#8212;&#8220;so absurdly simple that an ex-
planation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to
define the limits of observation and of deduction.
Observation tells me that you have a little reddish
mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the
Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pave-
ment and thrown up some earth which lies in such
a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in
entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint
which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Science of Deduction
</p>
<p>the neighborhood. So much is observation. The
rest is deduction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How, then, did you deduce the telegram?&#8221;
&#8220;Why, of course I knew that you had not writ-
</p>
<p>ten a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning.
I see also in your open desk there that you have a
sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards.
What could you go into the post-office for, then,
but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and
the one which remains must be the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case it certainly is so,&#8221; I replied, after a
little thought. &#8220;The thing, however, is, as you say,
of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if
I were to put your theories to a more severe test?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it would pre-
vent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.
I should be delighted to look into any problem
which you might submit to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard you say that it is difficult for a
man to have any object in daily use without leav-
ing the impress of his individuality upon it in such
a way that a trained observer might read it. Now,
I have here a watch which has recently come into
my possession. Would you have the kindness to let
me have an opinion upon the character or habits of
the late owner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I handed him over the watch with some slight
feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test
was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I in-
tended it as a lesson against the somewhat dog-
matic tone which he occasionally assumed. He
balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the
dial, opened the back, and examined the works,
first with his naked eyes and then with a power-
ful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling
at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the
case to and handed it back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hardly any data,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs
me of my most suggestive facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It was cleaned be-
fore being sent to me.&#8221; In my heart I accused my
companion of putting forward a most lame and
impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data
could he expect from an uncleaned watch?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though unsatisfactory, my research has not
been entirely barren,&#8221; he observed, staring up at
the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. &#8220;Subject
to your correction, I should judge that the watch
belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it
from your father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W.
upon the back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. The W. suggests your own name.
The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back,
and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was
made for the last generation. Jewelry usually de-
scents to the eldest son, and he is most likely to
have the same name as the father. Your father
has, if I remember right, been dead many years.
It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest
brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, so far,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Anything else?&#8221;
&#8220;He was a man of untidy habits,&#8212;very untidy
</p>
<p>and careless. He was left with good prospects, but
he threw away his chances, lived for some time in
poverty with occasional short intervals of prosper-
ity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all
I can gather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently
about the room with considerable bitterness in my
heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is unworthy of you, Holmes,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I
could not have believed that you would have de-
scended to this. You have made inquires into the
history of my unhappy brother, and you now pre-
tend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful
way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have
read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and,
to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear doctor,&#8221; said he, kindly, &#8220;pray accept
my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract
problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful
a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however,
that I never even know that you had a brother until
you handed me the watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how in the name of all that is wonder-
ful did you get these facts? They are absolutely
correct in every particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what
was the balance of probability. I did not at all ex-
pect to be so accurate.&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was not mere guess-work?&#8221;
&#8220;No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking
</p>
<p>habit,&#8212;destructive to the logical faculty. What
seems strange to you is only so because you do not
follow my train of thought or observe the small
facts upon which large inferences may depend.
For example, I began by stating that your brother
was careless. When you observe the lower part
