</p>
<p>No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work
was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was
massive, well made, and solid, like a chest con-
structed to carry things of great price, but not one
shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It
was absolutely and completely empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure is lost,&#8221; said Miss Morstan,
calmly.
</p>
<p>As I listened to the words and realized what
they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from
my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure
had weighed me down, until now that it was fi-
nally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal,
wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the
</p>
<p>golden barrier was gone from between us. &#8220;Thank
God!&#8221; I ejaculated from my very heart.
</p>
<p>She looked at me with a quick, questioning
smile. &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are within my reach again,&#8221; I
said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it.
&#8220;Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man
loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches,
sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell
you how I love you. That is why I said, &#8216;Thank
God.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I say, &#8216;Thank God,&#8217; too,&#8221; she whispered,
as I drew her to my side. Whoever had lost a trea-
sure, I knew that night that I had gained one.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.
The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>A very patient man was that inspector in the
cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him.
His face clouded over when I showed him the
empty box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes the reward!&#8221; said he, gloomily.
&#8220;Where there is no money there is no pay. This
night&#8217;s work would have been worth a tenner each
to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;He will see that you are rewarded, treasure or
no.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The inspector shook his head despondently,
however. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad job,&#8221; he repeated; &#8220;and so
Mr. Athelney Jones will think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His forecast proved to be correct, for the de-
tective looked blank enough when I got to Baker
Street and showed him the empty box. They had
only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for
they had changed their plans so far as to report
themselves at a station upon the way. My compan-
ion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual list-
less expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite
to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound
one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back
in his chair and laughed aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your doing, Small,&#8221; said Athelney
Jones, angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have put it away where you shall never
lay hand upon it,&#8221; he cried, exultantly. &#8220;It is my
treasure; and if I can&#8217;t have the loot I&#8217;ll take darned
good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
living man has any right to it, unless it is three
men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks
and myself. I know now that I cannot have the
use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have
acted all through for them as much as for myself.
It&#8217;s been the sign of four with us always. Well I
know that they would have had me do just what I
have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames
rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of
Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did
for Achmet. You&#8217;ll find the treasure where the key
is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your
launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe
place. There are no rupees for you this journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are deceiving us, Small,&#8221; said Athelney
Jones, sternly. &#8220;If you had wished to throw the
treasure into the Thames it would have been eas-
ier for you to have thrown box and all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to
recover,&#8221; he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong
look. &#8220;The man that was clever enough to hunt me
down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the
bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over
five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to
my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when
</p>
<p>106</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>you came up with us. However, there&#8217;s no good
grieving over it. I&#8217;ve had ups in my life, and I&#8217;ve
had downs, but I&#8217;ve learned not to cry over spilled
milk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very serious matter, Small,&#8221; said the
detective. &#8220;If you had helped justice, instead of
thwarting it in this way, you would have had a
better chance at your trial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Justice!&#8221; snarled the ex-convict. &#8220;A pretty jus-
tice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where
is the justice that I should give it up to those who
have never earned it? Look how I have earned
it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp,
all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night
chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by
mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every
cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take
it out of a white man. That was how I earned the
Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice be-
cause I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this
price only that another may enjoy it! I would
rather swing a score of times, or have one of
Tonga&#8217;s darts in my hide, than live in a convict&#8217;s
cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a
palace with the money that should be mine.&#8221; Small
had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this
came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes
blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with
the impassioned movement of his hands. I could
understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of
the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural
terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he
first learned that the injured convict was upon his
track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget that we know nothing of all this,&#8221;
said Holmes quietly. &#8220;We have not heard your
story, and we cannot tell how far justice may orig-
inally have been on your side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to
me, though I can see that I have you to thank that
I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear
no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If
you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it
back. What I say to you is God&#8217;s truth, every word
of it. Thank you; you can put the glass beside me
here, and I&#8217;ll put my lips to it if I am dry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Worcestershire man myself,&#8212;born near
Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of
Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have
often thought of taking a look round there, but the
truth is that I was never much of a credit to the
family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad
to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk,
small farmers, well known and respected over the
</p>
<p>country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At
last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave
them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over
a girl, and could only get out of it again by tak-
ing the queen&#8217;s shilling and joining the 3d Buffs,
which was just starting for India.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t destined to do much soldiering, how-
ever. I had just got past the goose-step, and
learned to handle my musket, when I was fool
enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily
for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was
in the water at the same time, and he was one of
the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile
took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped
off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have
done it, just above the knee. What with the shock
and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have
drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and
paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital
over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it
with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found
myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for
any active occupation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my
luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though
not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfor-
tune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A
man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as
an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after
his coolies and keep them up to their work. He
happened to be a friend of our colonel&#8217;s, who had
taken an interest in me since the accident. To make
a long story short, the colonel recommended me
strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly
to be done on horseback, my leg was no great ob-
stacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip
on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over
the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they
worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was
fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I
was content to spend the remainder of my life in
indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man,
and he would often drop into my little shanty and
smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel
their hearts warm to each other as they never do
here at home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was never in luck&#8217;s way long. Sud-
denly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny
broke upon us. One month India lay as still and
peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the
next there were two hundred thousand black dev-
ils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of
course you know all about it, gentlemen,&#8212;a deal
more than I do, very like, since reading is not in
</p>
<p>107</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>my line. I only know what I saw with my own
eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,
near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night
after night the whole sky was alight with the burn-
ing bungalows, and day after day we had small
companies of Europeans passing through our es-
tate with their wives and children, on their way
to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abel-
white was an obstinate man. He had it in his head
that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it
would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up.
There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-
pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was
in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him,
I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the
book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day
the crash came. I had been away on a distant plan-
tation, and was riding slowly home in the evening,
when my eye fell upon something all huddled to-
gether at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down
to see what it was, and the cold struck through my
heart when I found it was Dawson&#8217;s wife, all cut
into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native
dogs. A little further up the road Dawson him-
self was lying on his face, quite dead, with an
empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying
across each other in front of him. I reined up my
horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at
that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from
Abelwhite&#8217;s bungalow and the flames beginning
to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could
do my employer no good, but would only throw
my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From
where I stood I could see hundreds of the black
fiends, with their red coats still on their backs,
dancing and howling round the burning house.
Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bul-
lets sang past my head; so I broke away across the
paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe
within the walls at Agra.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it proved, however, there was no great
safety there, either. The whole country was up
like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could
collect in little bands they held just the ground
that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they
were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the mil-
lions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part
of it was that these men that we fought against,
foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked
troops, whom we had taught and trained, han-
dling our own weapons, and blowing our own
bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3d Bengal
Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a
battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks
and merchants had been formed, and this I joined,
</p>
<p>wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels
at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back
for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had
to fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst
news came to us from every side,&#8212;which is not to
be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will
see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow
is rather better than a hundred miles to the east,
and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From ev-
ery point on the compass there was nothing but
torture and murder and outrage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The city of Agra is a great place, swarming
with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all
sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the
narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across
the river, therefore, and took up his position in the
old fort at Agra. I don&#8217;t know if any of you gentle-
men have ever read or heard anything of that old
fort. It is a very queer place,&#8212;the queerest that
ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners,
too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should
think that the enclosure must be acres and acres.
There is a modern part, which took all our garri-
son, women, children, stores, and everything else,
with plenty of room over. But the modern part
is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where
nobody goes, and which is given over to the scor-
pions and the centipedes. It is all full of great de-
serted halls, and winding passages, and long cor-
ridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough
for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was sel-
dom that any one went into it, though now and
again a party with torches might go exploring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The river washes along the front of the old
fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and be-
hind there are many doors, and these had to be
guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in
that which was actually held by our troops. We
were short-handed, with hardly men enough to
man the angles of the building and to serve the
guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to sta-
tion a strong guard at every one of the innumer-
able gates. What we did was to organize a cen-
tral guard-house in the middle of the fort, and
to leave each gate under the charge of one white
man and two or three natives. I was selected to
take charge during certain hours of the night of
a small isolated door upon the southwest side of
the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed un-
der my command, and I was instructed if anything
went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely
upon help coming at once from the central guard.
As the guard was a good two hundred paces away,
however, and as the space between was cut up into
a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great
</p>
<p>108</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to
be of any use in case of an actual attack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was pretty proud at having this small
command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and
a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept
the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall,
fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdul-
lah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had
borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They
could talk English pretty well, but I could get little
out of them. They preferred to stand together and
jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For my-
self, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking
down on the broad, winding river and on the twin-
kling lights of the great city. The beating of drums,
the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of
the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were
enough to remind us all night of our dangerous
neighbors across the stream. Every two hours the
officer of the night used to come round to all the
posts, to make sure that all was well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The third night of my watch was dark and
dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary
work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in
such weather. I tried again and again to make my
Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in
the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a
moment the weariness of the night. Finding that
my companions would not be led into conversa-
tion, I took out my pipe, and laid down my mus-
ket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs
were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock
up and levelled it at my head, while the other held
a great knife to my throat and swore between his
teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a
step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My first thought was that these fellows were
in league with the rebels, and that this was the
beginning of an assault. If our door were in the
hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the
women and children be treated as they were in
Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am
just making out a case for myself, but I give you
my word that when I thought of that, though I
felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened
my mouth with the intention of giving a scream,
if it was my last one, which might alarm the main
guard. The man who held me seemed to know
my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he
whispered, &#8216;Don&#8217;t make a noise. The fort is safe
enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of
the river.&#8217; There was the ring of truth in what he
said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a
dead man. I could read it in the fellow&#8217;s brown
</p>
<p>eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it
was that they wanted from me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Listen to me, Sahib,&#8217; said the taller and fiercer
of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah
Khan. &#8216;You must either be with us now or you
must be silenced forever. The thing is too great
a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and
soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Chris-
tians, or your body this night shall be thrown into
the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in
the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is
it to be, death or life? We can only give you three
minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all
must be done before the rounds come again.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;How can I decide?&#8217; said I. &#8216;You have not told
me what you want of me. But I tell you know that
if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will
have no truck with it, so you can drive home your
knife and welcome.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It is nothing against the fort,&#8217; said he. &#8216;We
only ask you to do that which your countrymen
come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you
will be one of us this night, we will swear to you
upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath
which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you
shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of
the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But what is the treasure, then?&#8217; I asked. &#8216;I
am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will
but show me how it can be done.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You will swear, then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;by the bones
of your father, by the honor of your mother, by the
cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no
word against us, either now or afterwards?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I will swear it,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;provided that the
fort is not endangered.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then my comrade and I will swear that you
shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be
equally divided among the four of us.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There are but three,&#8217; said I.
&#8220; &#8216;No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can
</p>
<p>tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you
stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give no-
tice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib,
and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is
binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust
you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you
had sworn by all the gods in their false temples,
your blood would have been upon the knife, and
your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the
Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh.
Hearken, then, to what I have to say.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;There is a rajah in the northern provinces
who has much wealth, though his lands are small.
</p>
<p>109</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>Much has come to him from his father, and more
still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature
and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When
the troubles broke out he would be friends both
with the lion and the tiger,&#8212;with the Sepoy and
with the Company&#8217;s raj. Soon, however, it seemed
to him that the white men&#8217;s day was come, for
through all the land he could hear of nothing but
of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a
careful man, he made such plans that, come what
might, half at least of his treasure should be left to
him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by
him in the vaults of his palace, but the most pre-
cious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he
put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant
who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it
to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at
peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his
money, but if the Company conquered his jewels
would be saved to him. Having thus divided his
hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Se-
poys, since they were strong upon his borders. By
doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes
the due of those who have been true to their salt.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This pretended merchant, who travels under
the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra,
and desires to gain his way into the fort. He
has with him as travelling-companion my foster-
brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost
Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a
side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for
his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here
he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting
him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of
his coming. The world shall know of the merchant
Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the ra-
jah shall be divided among us. What say you to it,
Sahib?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a
great and a sacred thing; but it is very different
when there is fire and blood all round you and
you have been used to meeting death at every turn.
Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was
a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about
the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought
of what I might do in the old country with it,
and how my folk would stare when they saw their
ne&#8217;er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of
gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up
my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that
I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Consider, Sahib,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that if this man is
taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot,
and his jewels taken by the government, so that no
</p>
<p>man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since
we do the taking of him, why should we not do the
rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as
in the Company&#8217;s coffers. There will be enough
to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs.
No one can know about the matter, for here we are
cut off from all men. What could be better for the
purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are
with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I am with you heart and soul,&#8217; said I.
&#8220; &#8216;It is well,&#8217; he answered, handing me back my
</p>
<p>firelock. &#8216;You see that we trust you, for your word,
like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only
to wait for my brother and the merchant.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Does your brother know, then, of what you
will do?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The plan is his. He has devised it. We will
go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet
Singh.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rain was still falling steadily, for it was
just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy
clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard
to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay
in front of our door, but the water was in places
nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It
was strange to me to be standing there with those
two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was
coming to his death.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded
lantern at the other side of the moat. It van-
ished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared
again coming slowly in our direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Here they are!&#8217; I exclaimed.
&#8220; &#8216;You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,&#8217;
</p>
<p>whispered Abdullah. &#8216;Give him no cause for fear.
Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while
you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to
uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the
man.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The light had flickered onwards, now stop-
ping and now advancing, until I could see two
dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I
let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash
through the mire, and climb half-way up to the
gate, before I challenged them.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Who goes there?&#8217; said I, in a subdued voice.
&#8220; &#8216;Friends,&#8217; came the answer. I uncovered my
</p>
<p>lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The
first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard
which swept nearly down to his cummerbund.
Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man.
The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a
great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand,
done up in a shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the
ague, and his head kept turning to left and right
with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse
when he ventures out from his hole. It gave me the
chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the
treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within
me. When he saw my white face he gave a little
chirrup of joy and came running up towards me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Your protection, Sahib,&#8217; he panted,&#8212;&#8216;your
protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I
have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek
the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed
and beaten and abused because I have been the
friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this
when I am once more in safety,&#8212;I and my poor
possessions.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What have you in the bundle?&#8217; I asked.
&#8220; &#8216;An iron box,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;which contains
</p>
<p>one or two little family matters which are of no
value to others, but which I should be sorry to
lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward
you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he
will give me the shelter I ask.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not trust myself to speak longer with
the man. The more I looked at his fat, frightened
face, the harder did it seem that we should slay
him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Take him to the main guard,&#8217; said I. The two
Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the gi-
ant walked behind, while they marched in through
the dark gate-way. Never was a man so compassed
round with death. I remained at the gate-way with
the lantern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could hear the measured tramp of their foot-
steps sounding through the lonely corridors. Sud-
denly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle,
with the sound of blows. A moment later there
came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in
my direction, with the loud breathing of a running
man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight
passage, and there was the fat man, running like
the wind, with a smear of blood across his face,
and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the
great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in
his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as
that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh,
and I could see that if he once passed me and got
to the open air he would save himself yet. My
heart softened to him, but again the thought of
his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my
firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he
rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could
stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and
buried his knife twice in his side. The man never
</p>
<p>uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he
had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken
his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I
am keeping my promise. I am telling you every
work of the business just exactly as it happened,
whether it is in my favor or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, and held out his manacled hands
for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had
brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had
now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not
only for this cold-blooded business in which he
had been concerned, but even more for the some-
what flippant and careless way in which he nar-
rated it. Whatever punishment was in store for
him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from
me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their
hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the
story, but with the same disgust written upon their
faces. He may have observed it, for there was a
touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he
proceeded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all very bad, no doubt,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
should like to know how many fellows in my
shoes would have refused a share of this loot when
they knew that they would have their throats cut
for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when
once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the
whole business would come to light, and I should
have been court-martialled and shot as likely as
not; for people were not very lenient at a time like
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on with your story,&#8221; said Holmes, shortly.
&#8220;Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and
</p>
<p>I. A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so
short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door.
We took him to a place which the Sikhs had al-
ready prepared. It was some distance off, where a
winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the
brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces.
The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making
a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant
there, having first covered him over with loose
bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It lay where he had dropped it when he was
first attacked. The box was the same which now
lies open upon your table. A key was hung by
a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top.
We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed
upon a collection of gems such as I have read of
and thought about when I was a little lad at Per-
shore. It was blinding to look upon them. When
we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and
made a list of them. There were one hundred and
forty-three diamonds of the first water, including
one which has been called, I believe, &#8216;the Great
</p>
<p>111</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>Mogul&#8217; and is said to be the second largest stone
in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very
fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy ru-
bies, some of which, however, were small. There
were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sap-
phires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of
beryls, onyxes, cats&#8217;-eyes, turquoises, and other
stones, the very names of which I did not know
at the time, though I have become more familiar
with them since. Besides this, there were nearly
three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which
were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last
had been taken out of the chest and were not there
when I recovered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After we had counted our treasures we put
them back into the chest and carried them to the
gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then
we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each
other and be true to our secret. We agreed to
conceal our loot in a safe place until the country
should be at peace again, and then to divide it
equally among ourselves. There was no use di-
viding it at present, for if gems of such value were
found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there
was no privacy in the fort nor any place where
we could keep them. We carried the box, there-
fore, into the same hall where we had buried the
body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-
preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our
treasure. We made careful note of the place, and
next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and
put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we
had sworn that we should each always act for all,
so that none might take advantage. That is an oath
that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that
I have never broken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no use my telling you gentle-
men what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wil-
son took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the
back of the business was broken. Fresh troops
came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself
scarce over the frontier. A flying column under
Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared
the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be set-
tling upon the country, and we four were begin-
ning to hope that the time was at hand when we
might safely go off with our shares of the plunder.
In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered
by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It came about in this way. When the rajah put
his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it be-
cause he knew that he was a trusty man. They
are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what
does this rajah do but take a second even more
</p>
<p>trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon
the first? This second man was ordered never to
let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him
like his shadow. He went after him that night and
saw him pass through the doorway. Of course
he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and
applied for admission there himself next day, but
could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him
so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of
guides, who brought it to the ears of the comman-
dant. A thorough search was quickly made, and
the body was discovered. Thus at the very mo-
ment that we thought that all was safe we were
all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of
murder,&#8212;three of us because we had held the gate
that night, and the fourth because he was known
to have been in the company of the murdered man.
Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial,
for the rajah had been deposed and driven out
of India: so no one had any particular interest in
them. The murder, however, was clearly made out,
and it was certain that we must all have been con-
cerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude
for life, and I was condemned to death, though my
sentence was afterwards commuted into the same
as the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was rather a queer position that we found
ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by
the leg and with precious little chance of ever get-
ting out again, while we each held a secret which
might have put each of us in a palace if we could
only have made use of it. It was enough to make
a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick
and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have
rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous
fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to
be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I
was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on
and bided my time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last it seemed to me to have come. I was
changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to
Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few
white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had be-
haved well from the first, I soon found myself a
sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in
Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes
of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to
myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all
beyond our little clearings was infested with wild
cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow
a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There
was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and
a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy
enough all day; though in the evening we had a
little time to ourselves. Among other things, I

<p>112</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and
picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the
time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape;
but it is hundreds of miles from any other land,
and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it
was a terribly difficult job to get away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sport-
ing young chap, and the other young officers
would meet in his rooms of an evening and play
cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my
drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small
window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome,
I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and
then, standing there, I could hear their talk and
watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards
myself, and it was almost as good as having one
to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Cap-
tain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who
were in command of the native troops, and there
was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-
officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly
safe game. A very snug little party they used to
make.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there was one thing which very soon
struck me, and that was that the soldiers used al-
ways to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don&#8217;t
say that there was anything unfair, but so it was.
These prison-chaps had done little else than play
cards ever since they had been at the Andamans,
and they knew each other&#8217;s game to a point, while
the others just played to pass the time and threw
their cards down anyhow. Night after night the
soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they
got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto
was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and
gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand
and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a
few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck
would set in against him worse than ever. All day
he would wander about as black as thunder, and
he took to drinking a deal more than was good for
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One night he lost even more heavily than
usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Cap-
tain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to
their quarters. They were bosom friends, those
two, and never far apart. The major was raving
about his losses.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s all up, Morstan,&#8217; he was saying, as they
passed my hut. &#8216;I shall have to send in my papers.
I am a ruined man.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Nonsense, old chap!&#8217; said the other, slapping
him upon the shoulder. &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a nasty facer my-
self, but&#8212;&#8217; That was all I could hear, but it was
enough to set me thinking.
</p>
<p>A couple of days later Major Sholto was
strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of
speaking to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I wish to have your advice, major,&#8217; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, Small, what is it?&#8217; he asked, taking his
cheroot from his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I wanted to ask you, sir,&#8217; said I, &#8216;who is the
proper person to whom hidden treasure should be
handed over. I know where half a million worth
lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought per-
haps the best thing that I could do would be to
hand it over to the proper authorities, and then
perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for
me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Half a million, Small?&#8217; he gasped, looking
hard at me to see if I was in earnest.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Quite that, sir,&#8212;in jewels and pearls. It lies
there ready for anyone. And the queer thing about
it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot
hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;To government, Small,&#8217; he stammered,&#8212;&#8216;to
government.&#8217; But he said it in a halting fashion,
and I knew in my heart that I had got him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You think, then, sir, that I should give the
information to the Governor-General?&#8217; said I, qui-
etly.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, well, you must not do anything rash,
or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it,
Small. Give me the facts.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him the whole story, with small changes
so that he could not identify the places. When
I had finished he stood stock still and full of
thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that
there was a struggle going on within him.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;This is a very important matter, Small,&#8217; he
said, at last. &#8216;You must not say a word to any one
about it, and I shall see you again soon.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two nights later he and his friend Captain
Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night
with a lantern.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear
that story from your own lips, Small,&#8217; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeated it as I had told it before.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It rings true, eh?&#8217; said he. &#8216;It&#8217;s good enough
to act upon?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Morstan nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Look here, Small,&#8217; said the major. &#8216;We have
been talking it over, my friend here and I, and
we have come to the conclusion that this secret of
yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but
is a private concern of your own, which of course

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>you have the power of disposing of as you think
best. Now, the question is, what price would you
ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and
at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.&#8217;
He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his
eyes were shining with excitement and greed.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Why, as to that, gentlemen,&#8217; I answered, try-
ing also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he
did, &#8216;there is only one bargain which a man in my
position can make. I shall want yo to help me to
my freedom, and to help my three companions to
theirs. We shall then take yo into partnership, and
give you a fifth share to divide between you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Hum!&#8217; said he. &#8216;A fifth share! That is not
very tempting.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It would come to fifty thousand apiece,&#8217; said
I.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;But how can we gain your freedom? You
know very well that you ask an impossibility.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Nothing of the sort,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;I have
thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar
to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the
voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a
time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls
at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn
well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to
get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us
on any part of the Indian coast you will have done
your part of the bargain.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;If there were only one,&#8217; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;None or all,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;We have sworn it.
The four of us must always act together.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You see, Morstan,&#8217; said he, &#8216;Small is a man
of his word. He does not flinch from his friend. I
think we may very well trust him.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;It&#8217;s a dirty business,&#8217; the other answered.
&#8216;Yet, as you say, the money would save our com-
missions handsomely.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Well, Small,&#8217; said the major, &#8216;we must, I sup-
pose, try and meet you. We must first, of course,
test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box
is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back
to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into
the affair.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Not so fast,&#8217; said I, growing colder as he got
hot. &#8216;I must have the consent of my three com-
rades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; he broke in. &#8216;What have three
black fellows to do with our agreement?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Black or blue,&#8217; said I, &#8216;they are in with me,
and we all go together.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the matter ended by a second meeting,
at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and
Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter
over again, and at last we came to an arrangement.
We were to provide both the officers with charts of
the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the
wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was
to go to India to test our story. If he found the box
he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht
provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rut-
land Island, and to which we were to make our
way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain
Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to
meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a fi-
nal division of the treasure, he taking the major&#8217;s
share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the
most solemn oaths that the mind could think or
the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink,
and by the morning I had the two charts all ready,
signed with the sign of four,&#8212;that is, of Abdullah,
Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long
story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is im-
patient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I&#8217;ll
make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto
went off to India, but he never came back again.
Captain Morstan showed me his name among a
list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very
shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving
him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he
could stoop to treat five men as he had treated
us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards,
and found, as we expected, that the treasure was
indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, with-
out carrying out one of the conditions on which
we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived
only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and
I nursed it by night. It became an overpower-
ing, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing
for the law,&#8212;nothing for the gallows. To escape,
to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his
throat,&#8212;that was my one thought. Even the Agra
treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my
mind than the slaying of Sholto.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have set my mind on many things in
this life, and never one which I did not carry out.
But it was weary years before my time came. I
have told you that I had picked up something of
medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down
with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked
up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick
to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die.
I took him in hand, though he was as venomous
as a young snake, and after a couple of months I
got him all right and able to walk. He took a kind

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Strange Story of Jonathan Small
</p>
<p>of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to
his woods, but was always hanging about my hut.
I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this
made him all the fonder of me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonga&#8212;for that was his name&#8212;was a fine
boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his
own. When I found that he was devoted to me and
would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance
of escape. I talked it over with him. He was to
bring his boat round on a certain night to an old
wharf which was never guarded, and there he was
to pick me up. I gave him directions to have sev-
eral gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts,
and sweet potatoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No
man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night
named he had his boat at the wharf. As it chanced,
however, there was one of the convict-guard down
there,&#8212;a vile Pathan who had never missed a
chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always
vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It
was as if fate had placed him in my way that I
might pay my debt before I left the island. He
stood on the bank with his back to me, and his car-
bine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to
beat out his brains with, but none could I see. Then
a queer thought came into my head and showed
me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat
down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden
leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put
his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full,
and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You
can see the split in the wood now where I hit him.
We both went down together, for I could not keep
my balance, but when I got up I found him still
lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an
hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought
all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and
his gods. Among other things, he had a long bam-
boo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting,
with which I make a sort of sail. For ten days
we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on
the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which
was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo
of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and
Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among
them. They had one very good quality: they let
you alone and asked no questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures
that my little chum and I went through, you would
not thank me, for I would have you here until the
sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about
the world, something always turning up to keep
us from London. All the time, however, I never
</p>
<p>lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto
at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my
sleep. At last, however, some three or four years
ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great
difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set
to work to discover whether he had realized the
treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with
someone who could help me,&#8212;I name no names,
for I don&#8217;t want to get any one else in a hole,&#8212;and
I soon found that he still had the jewels. Then I
tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty
sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his
sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, however, I got word that he was dy-
ing. I hurried at once to the garden, mad that
he should slip out of my clutches like that, and,
looking through the window, I saw him lying in
his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I&#8217;d
have come through and taken my chance with the
three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw
dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into
his room that same night, though, and I searched
his papers to see if there was any record of where
he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line,
however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a
man could be. Before I left I bethought me that
if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a
satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of
our hatred: so I scrawled down the sign of the four
of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it
on his bosom. It was too much that he should be
taken to the grave without some token from the
men whom he had robbed and befooled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We earned a living at this time by my exhibit-
ing poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as
the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and
dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful
of pennies after a day&#8217;s work. I still heard all the
news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years
there was no news to hear, except that they were
hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came
what we had waited for so long. The treasure had
been found. It was up at the top of the house, in
Mr. Bartholomew Sholto&#8217;s chemical laboratory. I
came at once and had a look at the place, but I
could not see how with my wooden leg I was to
make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a
trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto&#8217;s
supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage
the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out
with me with a long rope wound round his waist.
He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his
way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have
it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to
his cost. Tonga thought he had done something
</p>
<p>115</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>very clever in killing him, for when I came up by
the rope I found him strutting about as proud as
a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I
made at him with the rope&#8217;s end and cursed him
for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-
box and let it down, and then slid down myself,
having first left the sign of the four upon the ta-
ble, to show that the jewels had come back at last
to those who had most right to them. Tonga then
pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made
off the way that he had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I have anything else to tell
you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of
Smith&#8217;s launch, the Aurora, so I thought she would
be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with
old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he
got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that
there was some screw loose, but he was not in our
secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you,
gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,&#8212;for you have
not done me a very good turn,&#8212;but it is because I
believe the best defence I can make is just to hold
back nothing, but let all the wold know how badly
I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and
how innocent I am of the death of his son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very remarkable account,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes. &#8220;A fitting wind-up to an extremely in-
teresting case. There is nothing at all new to me
in the latter part of your narrative, except that you
brought your own rope. That I did not know. By
the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his
darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the
boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had lost them all, sir, except the one which
was in his blow-pipe at the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, of course,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;I had not
thought of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any other point which you would like
to ask about?&#8221; asked the convict, affably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, thank you,&#8221; my companion an-
swered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Holmes,&#8221; said Athelney Jones, &#8220;You are
a man to be humored, and we all know that you
are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I
have gone rather far in doing what you and your
friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when
we have our story-teller here safe under lock and
key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspec-
tors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both
for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted
at the trial. Good-night to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, gentlemen both,&#8221; said Jonathan
Small.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You first, Small,&#8221; remarked the wary Jones as
they left the room. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take particular care that
you don&#8217;t club me with your wooden leg, what-
ever you may have done to the gentleman at the
Andaman Isles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and there is the end of our little drama,&#8221;
I remarked, after we had set some time smoking in
silence. &#8220;I fear that it may be the last investigation
in which I shall have the chance of studying your
methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honor to
accept me as a husband in prospective.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave a most dismal groan. &#8220;I feared as
much,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I really cannot congratulate you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was a little hurt. &#8220;Have you any reason to be
dissatisfied with my choice?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I think she is one of the most
charming young ladies I ever met, and might have
been most useful in such work as we have been do-
ing. She had a decided genius that way: witness
the way in which she preserved that Agra plan
from all the other papers of her father. But love
is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional
is opposed to that true cold reason which I place
above all things. I should never marry myself, lest
I bias my judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust,&#8221; said I, laughing, &#8220;that my judgment
may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall
be as limp as a rag for a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; said I, &#8220;how terms of what in an-
other man I should call laziness alternate with
your fits of splendid energy and vigor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;there are in me the mak-
ings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry
sort of fellow. I often think of those lines of old
Goethe,&#8212;
</p>
<p>Schade, da&#223; die Natur nur
einen Mensch aus Dir schuf,
</p>
<p>Denn zum wu&#168;rdigen Mann war
und zum Schelmen der Stoff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, a propos of this Norwood busi-
ness, you see that they had, as I surmised, a con-
federate in the house, who could be none other
than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the
undivided honor of having caught one fish in his
great haul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The division seems rather unfair,&#8221; I remarked.
&#8220;You have done all the work in this business. I get
a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what
remains for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes, &#8220;there still
remains the cocaine-bottle.&#8221; And he stretched his
long white hand up for it.

<p>CHAPTER I.

<p>T
</p>
<p>o Sherlock Holmes she is always the
woman. I have seldom heard him men-
tion her under any other name. In his
eyes she eclipses and predominates the
</p>
<p>whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emo-
tion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and
that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,
precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I
take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing
machine that the world has seen, but as a lover
he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a
gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for
the observer&#8212;excellent for drawing the veil from
men&#8217;s motives and actions. But for the trained rea-
soner to admit such intrusions into his own del-
icate and finely adjusted temperament was to in-
troduce a distracting factor which might throw a
doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensi-
tive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-
power lenses, would not be more disturbing than
a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet
there was but one woman to him, and that woman
was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and question-
able memory.
</p>
<p>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage
had drifted us away from each other. My own
complete happiness, and the home-centred inter-
ests which rise up around the man who first finds
himself master of his own establishment, were suf-
ficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,
who loathed every form of society with his whole
Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker
Street, buried among his old books, and alternat-
ing from week to week between cocaine and am-
bition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce
energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as
ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and
occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary
powers of observation in following out those clues,
and clearing up those mysteries which had been
abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From
time to time I heard some vague account of his
doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of
the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the sin-
gular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trinco-
malee, and finally of the mission which he had ac-
complished so delicately and successfully for the
reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
his activity, however, which I merely shared with
all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
my former friend and companion.
</p>
<p>One night&#8212;it was on the twentieth of March,
</p>
<p>1888&#8212;I was returning from a journey to a patient
(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my
way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the
well-remembered door, which must always be as-
sociated in my mind with my wooing, and with
the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was
seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and
to know how he was employing his extraordinary
powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as
I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice
in a dark
