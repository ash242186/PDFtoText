<p>CHAPTER X.
The End of the Islander
</p>
<p>Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk
exceedingly well when he chose, and that night
he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of
nervous exaltation. I have never known him so
brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of sub-
jects,&#8212;on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on
Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon,
and on the war-ships of the future,&#8212;handling each
as though he had made a special study of it. His
bright humor marked the reaction from his black
depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones
proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relax-
ation, and face his dinner with the air of a bon vi-
vant. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that
we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught
something of Holmes&#8217;s gaiety. None of us alluded
during dinner to the cause which had brought us
together.
</p>
<p>When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced
at this watch, and filled up three glasses with port.
&#8220;One bumper,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to the success of our little
expedition. And now it is high time we were off.
Have you a pistol, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my old service-revolver in my desk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had best take it, then. It is well to be pre-
pared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it
for half-past six.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a little past seven before we reached the
Westminster wharf, and found our launch await-
ing us. Holmes eyed it critically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8212;that green lamp at the side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take it off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The small change was made, we stepped on
board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes,
and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the
rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly
police-inspectors forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; asked Jones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Ja-
cobson&#8217;s Yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We
shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though
they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfac-
tion as we overhauled a river steamer and left her
behind us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to catch anything on the
river,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardly that. But there are not many
launches to beat us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has
a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the
land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was
at being balked by so small a thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by
plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our
greatest statesmen has said that a change of work
is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in
dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work
at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and
thought the whole matter out again. My boys had
been up the river and down the river without re-
sult. The launch was not at any landing-stage or
wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly
have been scuttled to hide their traces,&#8212;though
that always remained as a possible hypothesis if
all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain
degree of low cunning, but I did not think him ca-
pable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse.
That is usually a product of higher education. I
then reflected that since he had certainly been in
London some time&#8212;as we had evidence that he
maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry
Lodge&#8212;he could hardly leave at a moment&#8217;s no-
tice, but would need some little time, if it were
only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the
balance of probability, at any rate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me to be a little weak,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It
is more probable that he had arranged his affairs
before ever he set out upon his expedition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would
be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him
to give it up until he was sure that he could
do without it. But a second consideration struck
me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the pecu-
liar appearance of his companion, however much
he may have top-coated him, would give rise to
gossip, and possibly be associated with this Nor-
wood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see
that. They had started from their head-quarters
under cover of darkness, and he would wish to
get back before it was broad light. Now, it was
past three o&#8217;clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when
they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and
people would be about in an hour or so. There-
fore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid
Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch
</p>
<p>100</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The End of the Islander
</p>
<p>for the final escape, and hurried to their lodg-
ings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights,
when they had time to see what view the papers
took, and whether there was any suspicion, they
would make their way under cover of darkness to
some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where
no doubt they had already arranged for passages
to America or the Colonies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the launch? They could not have taken
that to their lodgings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. I argued that the launch must be
no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then
put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it
as a man of his capacity would. He would prob-
ably consider that to send back the launch or to
keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the
police did happen to get on his track. How, then,
could he conceal the launch and yet have her at
hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do
myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of
one way of doing it. I might land the launch over
to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to
make a trifling change in her. She would then be
removed to his shed or hard, and so be effectually
concealed, while at the same time I could have her
at a few hours&#8217; notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems simple enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just these very simple things which are
extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I de-
termined to act on the idea. I started at once in
this harmless seaman&#8217;s rig and inquired at all the
yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at
the sixteenth&#8212;Jacobson&#8217;s&#8212;I learned that the Au-
rora had been handed over to them two days ago
by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial direc-
tions as to her rudder. &#8216;There ain&#8217;t naught amiss
with her rudder,&#8217; said the foreman. &#8216;There she
lies, with the red streaks.&#8217; At that moment who
should come down but Mordecai Smith, the miss-
ing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I
should not, of course, have known him, but he bel-
lowed out his name and the name of his launch. &#8216;I
want her to-night at eight o&#8217;clock,&#8217; said he,&#8212;&#8216;eight
o&#8217;clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who
won&#8217;t be kept waiting.&#8217; They had evidently paid
him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking
shillings about to the men. I followed him some
distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I
went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up
one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a
sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water&#8217;s
edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they
start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will
</p>
<p>be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure,
and all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have planned it all very neatly, whether
they are the right men or not,&#8220; said Jones; &#8221;but
if the affair were in my hands I should have had
a body of police in Jacobson&#8217;s Yard, and arrested
them when they came down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would have been never. This man
Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send
a scout on ahead, and if anything made him sus-
picious lie snug for another week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith,
and so been led to their hiding-place,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I should have wasted my day. I
think that it is a hundred to one against Smith
knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor
and good pay, why should he ask questions? They
send him messages what to do. No, I thought over
every possible course, and this is the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While this conversation had been proceeding,
we had been shooting the long series of bridges
which span the Thames. As we passed the City
the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon
the summit of St. Paul&#8217;s. It was twilight before we
reached the Tower.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Jacobson&#8217;s Yard,&#8221; said Holmes, point-
ing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Sur-
rey side. &#8220;Cruise gently up and down here under
cover of this string of lighters.&#8221; He took a pair of
night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time
at the shore. &#8220;I see my sentry at his post,&#8221; he re-
marked, &#8220;but no sign of a handkerchief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we go down-stream a short way and
lie in wait for them,&#8221; said Jones, eagerly. We were
all eager by this time, even the policemen and stok-
ers, who had a very vague idea of what was going
forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no right to take anything for
granted,&#8221; Holmes answered. &#8220;It is certainly ten
to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot
be certain. From this point we can see the entrance
of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will
be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay
where we are. See how the folk swarm over yon-
der in the gaslight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming from work in the yard.&#8221;
&#8220;Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one
</p>
<p>has some little immortal spark concealed about
him. You would not think it, to look at them. There
is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma
is man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one calls him a soul concealed in an an-
imal,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>101</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>&#8220;Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;He remarks that, while the individ-
ual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate
he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for
example, never foretell what any one man will do,
but you can say with precision what an average
number will be up to. Individuals vary, but per-
centages remain constant. So says the statistician.
But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white
flutter over yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is your boy,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I can see him
plainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is the Aurora,&#8221; exclaimed Holmes,
&#8220;and going like the devil! Full speed ahead, en-
gineer. Make after that launch with the yellow
light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if
she proves to have the heels of us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had slipped unseen through the yard-
entrance and passed behind two or three small
craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before
we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream,
near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate.
Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I doubt if we shall
catch her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must catch her!&#8221; cried Holmes, between
his teeth. &#8220;Heap it on, stokers! Make her do all
she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>We were fairly after her now. The furnaces
roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and
clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,
steep prow cut through the river-water and sent
two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With
every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered
like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in
our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in
front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the wa-
ter showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of
white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which
she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers,
merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and
round the other. Voices hailed us out of the dark-
ness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we
followed close upon her track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pile it on, men, pile it on!&#8221; cried Holmes, look-
ing down into the engine-room, while the fierce
glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline
face. &#8220;Get every pound of steam you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we gain a little,&#8221; said Jones, with his
eyes on thea Aurora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;We shall be up with
her in a very few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment, however, as our evil fate
would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blun-
dered in between us. It was only by putting our
helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and
before we could round them and recover our way
the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards.
She was still, however, well in view, and the murky
uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit
night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost,
and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the
fierce energy which was driving us along. We had
shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks,
down the long Deptford Reach, and up again af-
ter rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in
front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into
the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light
upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures
upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with
something black between his knees over which he
stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked
like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller,
while against the red glare of the furnace I could
see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovel-
ling coals for dear life. They may have had some
doubt at first as to whether we were really pur-
suing them, but now as we followed every wind-
ing and turning which they took there could no
longer be any question about it. At Greenwich
we were about three hundred paces behind them.
At Blackwall we could not have been more than
two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many crea-
tures in many countries during my checkered ca-
reer, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill
as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames.
Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In
the silence of the night we could hear the panting
and clanking of their machinery. The man in the
stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms
were moving as though he were busy, while ev-
ery now and then he would look up and measure
with a glance the distance which still separated us.
Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them
to stop. We were not more than four boat&#8217;s lengths
behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous
pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Bark-
ing Level upon one side and the melancholy Plum-
stead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man
in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook
his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a
high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, pow-
erful man, and as he stood poising himself with
legs astride I could see that from the thigh down-
wards there was but a wooden stump upon the
right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries
there was movement
