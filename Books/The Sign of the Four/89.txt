</p>
<p>that a man who inherits one article of such value
is pretty well provided for in other respects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.
&#8220;It is very customary for pawnbrokers in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, when they take a watch, to scratch the num-
ber of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside
of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there
is no risk of the number being lost or transposed.
There are no less than four such numbers visible to
my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,&#8212;that
your brother was often at low water. Secondary
inference,&#8212;that he had occasional bursts of pros-
perity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge.
Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which
contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of
scratches all round the hole,&#8212;marks where the key
has slipped. What sober man&#8217;s key could have
scored those grooves? But you will never see a
drunkard&#8217;s watch without them. He winds it at
night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady
hand. Where is the mystery in all this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is as clear as daylight,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I re-
gret the injustice which I did you. I should have
had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I
</p>
<p>ask whether you have any professional inquiry on
foot at present?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live with-
out brain-work. What else is there to live for?
Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary,
dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow
fog swirls down the street and drifts across the
duncolored houses. What could be more hope-
lessly prosaic and material? What is the use of
having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon
which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, exis-
tence is commonplace, and no qualities save those
which are commonplace have any function upon
earth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade,
when with a crisp knock our landlady entered,
bearing a card upon the brass salver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A young lady for you, sir,&#8221; she said, address-
ing my companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Mary Morstan,&#8221; he read. &#8220;Hum! I have
no recollection of the name. Ask the young lady to
step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don&#8217;t go, doctor. I should
prefer that you remain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
The Statement of the Case
</p>
<p>Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm
step and an outward composure of manner. She
was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well
gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste.
There was, however, a plainness and simplicity
about her costume which bore with it a sugges-
tion of limited means. The dress was a sombre
grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she
wore a small turban of the same dull hue, re-
lieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the
side. Her face had neither regularity of feature
nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was
sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were
singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experi-
ence of women which extends over many nations
and three separate continents, I have never looked
upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a re-
fined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe
that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes
</p>
<p>placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quiv-
ered, and she showed every sign of intense inward
agitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Ce-
cil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complica-
tion. She was much impressed by your kindness
and skill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cecil Forrester,&#8221; he repeated thought-
fully. &#8220;I believe that I was of some slight service
to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a
very simple one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not think so. But at least you cannot
say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine any-
thing more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than
the situation in which I find myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glis-
tened. He leaned forward in his chair with an ex-
pression of extraordinary concentration upon his
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Statement of the Case
</p>
<p>clear-cut, hawklike features. &#8220;State your case,&#8221;
said he, in brisk, business tones.
</p>
<p>I felt that my position was an embarrassing
one. &#8220;You will, I am sure, excuse me,&#8221; I said, rising
from my chair.
</p>
<p>To my surprise, the young lady held up her
gloved hand to detain me. &#8220;If your friend,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;would be good enough to stop, he might be
of inestimable service to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I relapsed into my chair.
&#8220;Briefly,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;the facts are these.
</p>
<p>My father was an officer in an Indian regiment
who sent me home when I was quite a child. My
mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.
I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding
establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained
until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878
my father, who was senior captain of his regiment,
obtained twelve months&#8217; leave and came home. He
telegraphed to me from London that he had ar-
rived all safe, and directed me to come down at
once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address.
His message, as I remember, was full of kindness
and love. On reaching London I drove to the Lang-
ham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was
staying there, but that he had gone out the night
before and had not yet returned. I waited all day
without news of him. That night, on the advice
of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with
the police, and next morning we advertised in all
the papers. Our inquiries let to no result; and from
that day to this no word has ever been heard of my
unfortunate father. He came home with his heart
full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and
instead&#8212;&#8221; She put her hand to her throat, and a
choking sob cut short the sentence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The date?&#8221; asked Holmes, opening his note-
book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He disappeared upon the 3d of December,
1878,&#8212;nearly ten years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His luggage?&#8221;
&#8220;Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in
</p>
<p>it to suggest a clue,&#8212;some clothes, some books,
and a considerable number of curiosities from the
Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers
in charge of the convict-guard there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had he any friends in town?&#8221;
&#8220;Only one that we know of,&#8212;Major Sholto,
</p>
<p>of his own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry.
The major had retired some little time before, and
lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with
him, of course, but he did not even know that his
brother officer was in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A singular case,&#8221; remarked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not yet described to you the most sin-
gular part. About six years ago&#8212;to be exact, upon
the 4th of May, 1882&#8212;an advertisement appeared
in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary
Morstan and stating that it would be to her ad-
vantage to come forward. There was no name or
address appended. I had at that time just entered
the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity
of governess. By her advice I published my ad-
dress in the advertisement column. The same day
there arrived through the post a small card-board
box addressed to me, which I found to contain a
very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing
was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same
date there has always appeared a similar box, con-
taining a similar pearl, without any clue as to the
sender. They have been pronounced by an expert
to be of a rare variety and of considerable value.
You can see for yourselves that they are very hand-
some.&#8221; She opened a flat box as she spoke, and
showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever
seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your statement is most interesting,&#8221; said Sher-
lock Holmes. &#8220;Has anything else occurred to
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I
have come to you. This morning I received this
letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;The envelope
too, please. Postmark, London, S.W. Date, July 7.
Hum! Man&#8217;s thumb-mark on corner,&#8212;probably
postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at six-
pence a packet. Particular man in his stationery.
No address. &#8216;Be at the third pillar from the left out-
side the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o&#8217;clock.
If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are
a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not
bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your
unknown friend.&#8217; Well, really, this is a very pretty
little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss
Morstan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what I want to ask you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall most certainly go. You and I
and&#8212;yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your
correspondent says two friends. He and I have
worked together before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But would he come?&#8221; she asked, with some-
thing appealing in her voice and expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be proud and happy,&#8221; said I, fer-
vently, &#8220;if I can be of any service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are both very kind,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
have led a retired life, and have no friends whom
</p>
<p>71</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I
suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be later,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;There
is one other point, however. Is this handwriting
the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have them here,&#8221; she answered, producing
half a dozen pieces of paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly a model client. You have the
correct intuition. Let us see, now.&#8221; He spread out
the papers upon the table, and gave little darting
glances from one to the other. &#8220;They are disguised
hands, except the letter,&#8221; he said, presently, &#8220;but
there can be no question as to the authorship. See
how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and
see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly
by the same person. I should not like to suggest
false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resem-
blance between this hand and that of your father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be more unlike.&#8221;
&#8220;I expected to hear you say so. We shall look
</p>
<p>out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the
papers. I may look into the matter before then. It
is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Au revoir,&#8221; said our visitor, and, with a bright,
kindly glance from one to the other of us, she re-
placed her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried
away. Standing at the window, I watched her walk-
ing briskly down the street, until the gray turban
and white feather were but a speck in the sombre
crowd.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a very attractive woman!&#8221; I exclaimed,
turning to my companion.
</p>
<p>He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning
back with drooping eyelids. &#8220;Is she?&#8221; he said, lan-
guidly. &#8220;I did not observe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You really are an automaton,&#8212;a calculating-
machine!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;There is something positively
inhuman in you at times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled gently. &#8220;It is of the first importance,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;not to allow your judgment to be biased
by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere
unit,&#8212;a factor in a problem. The emotional qual-
ities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure
</p>
<p>you that the most winning woman I ever knew
was hanged for poisoning three little children for
their insurance-money, and the most repellant man
of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has
spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the Lon-
don poor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, however&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never make exceptions. An exception dis-
proves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to
study character in handwriting? What do you
make of this fellow&#8217;s scribble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is legible and regular,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;A man
of business habits and some force of character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head. &#8220;Look at his long let-
ters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They hardly rise above the com-
mon herd. That d might be an a, and that l an
e. Men of character always differentiate their long
letters, however illegibly they may write. There is
vacillation in his k&#8217;s and self-esteem in his capitals.
I am going out now. I have some few references
to make. Let me recommend this book,&#8212;one of
the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood
Reade&#8217;s Martyrdom of Man. I shall be back in an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I sat in the window with the volume in my
hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring
speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon
our late visitor,&#8212;her smiles, the deep rich tones
of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung
her life. If she were seventeen at the time of
her father&#8217;s disappearance she must be seven-and-
twenty now,&#8212;a sweet age, when youth has lost its
self-consciousness and become a little sobered by
experience. So I sat and mused, until such dan-
gerous thoughts came into my head that I hur-
ried away to my desk and plunged furiously into
the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I,
an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker
banking-account, that I should dare to think of
such things? She was a unit, a factor,&#8212;nothing
more. If my future were black, it was better surely
to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it
by mere will-o&#8217;-the-wisps of the imagination.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
In Quest of a Solution
</p>
<p>It was half-past five before Holmes returned.
He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,&#8212;a
mood which in his case alternated with fits of the
blackest depression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no great mystery in this matter,&#8221; he
said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out
for him. &#8220;The facts appear to admit of only one
explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! you have solved it already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that would be too much to say. I have
discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, how-
ever, very suggestive. The details are still to be
added. I have just found, on consulting the back
files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Nor-
word, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon
the 28th of April, 1882.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see
what this suggests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way,
then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only per-
son in London whom he could have visited is Ma-
jor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that
he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies.
Within a week of his death Captain Morstan&#8217;s daugh-
ter receives a valuable present, which is repeated
from year to year, and now culminates in a letter
which describes her as a wronged woman. What
wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of
her father? And why should the presents begin
immediately after Sholto&#
