<p>not very far. I will wait for you here if you will
drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means. I don&#8217;t think I could rest until I
know more of this fantastic business. I have seen
something of the rough side of life, but I give you
my word that this quick succession of strange sur-
prises to-night has shaken my nerve completely.
I should like, however, to see the matter through
with you, now that I have got so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your presence will be of great service to me,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;We shall work the case out inde-
pendently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over
any mare&#8217;s-nest which he may choose to construct.
When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you
to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the
water&#8217;s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the
right-hand side is a bird-stuffer&#8217;s: Sherman is the
name. You will see a weasel holding a young rab-
</p>
<p>bit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and
tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby
at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dog, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8212;a queer mongrel, with a most amazing
power of scent. I would rather have Toby&#8217;s help
than that of the whole detective force of London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall bring him, then,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It is one now.
I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh
horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;shall see what I can
learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian
servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the
next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones&#8217;s
methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms.

<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Episode of the Barrel
</p>
<p>The police had brought a cab with them, and
in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home.
After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne
trouble with a calm face as long as there was
some one weaker than herself to support, and I
had found her bright and placid by the side of
the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however,
she first turned faint, and then burst into a pas-
sion of weeping,&#8212;so sorely had she been tried by
the adventures of the night. She has told me since
that she thought me cold and distant upon that
journey. She little guessed the struggle within my
breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me
back. My sympathies and my love went out to
her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt
that years of the conventionalities of life could not
teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had
this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were
two thoughts which sealed the words of affection
upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken
in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disad-
vantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time.
Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes&#8217;s researches
were successful, she would be an heiress. Was
it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon
</p>
<p>should take such advantage of an intimacy which
chance had brought about? Might she not look
upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could
not bear to risk that such a thought should cross
her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an
impassable barrier between us.
</p>
<p>It was nearly two o&#8217;clock when we reached
Mrs. Cecil Forrester&#8217;s. The servants had retired
hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so inter-
ested by the strange message which Miss Morstan
had received that she had sat up in the hope of
her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-
aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see
how tenderly her arm stole round the other&#8217;s waist
and how motherly was the voice in which she
greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid depen-
dant, but an honored friend. I was introduced, and
Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and
tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the
importance of my errand, and promised faithfully
to call and report any progress which we might
make with the case. As we drove away I stole a
glance back, and I still seem to see that little group
on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the
half-opened door, the hall light shining through
</p>
<p>86</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Episode of the Barrel
</p>
<p>stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-
rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing
glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of
the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.
</p>
<p>And the more I thought of what had happened,
the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the
whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rat-
tled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was
the original problem: that at least was pretty clear
now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending
of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,&#8212;we
had had light upon all those events. They had
only led us, however, to a deeper and far more
tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious
plan found among Morstan&#8217;s baggage, the strange
scene at Major Sholto&#8217;s death, the rediscovery of
the treasure immediately followed by the murder
of the discoverer, the very singular accompani-
ments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable
weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding
with those upon Captain Morstan&#8217;s chart,&#8212;here
was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singu-
larly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well
despair of ever finding the clue.
</p>
<p>Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied
brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I
had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could
make my impression. At last, however, there was
the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face
looked out at the upper window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, you drunken vagabone,&#8221; said the face.
&#8220;If you kick up any more row I&#8217;ll open the kennels
and let out forty-three dogs upon you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let one out it&#8217;s just what I have come
for,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; yelled the voice. &#8220;So help me gra-
cious, I have a wiper in the bag, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll drop it on
your &#8217;ead if you don&#8217;t hook it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want a dog,&#8221; I cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be argued with!&#8221; shouted Mr. Sher-
man. &#8220;Now stand clear, for when I say &#8216;three,&#8217;
down goes the wiper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&#8212;&#8221; I began, but the
words had a most magical effect, for the window
instantly slammed down, and within a minute the
door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was
a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a
stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Step in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for
he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a
nip at the gentleman?&#8221; This to a stoat which thrust
its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of
</p>
<p>its cage. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind that, sir: it&#8217;s only a slow-
worm. It hain&#8217;t got no fangs, so I gives it the run
o&#8217; the room, for it keeps the bettles down. You
must not mind my bein&#8217; just a little short wi&#8217; you at
first, for I&#8217;m guyed at by the children, and there&#8217;s
many a one just comes down this lane to knock me
up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted,
sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted a dog of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! that would be Toby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Toby was the name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.&#8221; He moved
slowly forward with his candle among the queer
animal family which he had gathered round him.
In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly
that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping
down at us from every cranny and corner. Even
the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn
fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg
to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.
</p>
<p>Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared
creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-
and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling
gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump
of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me,
and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed
me to the cab, and made no difficulties about ac-
companying me. It had just struck three on the
Palace clock when I found myself back once more
at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter Mc-
Murdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory,
and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off
to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow
gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on
my mentioning the detective&#8217;s name.
</p>
<p>Holmes was standing on the door-step, with
his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you have him there!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Good dog,
then! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an
immense display of energy since you left. He has
arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gate-
keeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant.
We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant
up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended
the stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that
a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A
weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the cor-
ner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend me your bull&#8217;s-eye, sergeant,&#8221; said my
companion. &#8220;Now tie this bit of card round my
neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.
Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.&#8212;Just
</p>
<p>87</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>you carry them down with you, Watson. I am go-
ing to do a little climbing. And dip my handker-
chief into the creasote. That will do. Now come
up into the garret with me for a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We clambered up through the hole. Holmes
turned his light once more upon the footsteps in
the dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you particularly to notice these foot-
marks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you observe anything note-
worthy about them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They belong,&#8221; I said, &#8220;to a child or a small
woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing
else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They appear to be much as other footmarks.&#8221;
&#8220;Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a
</p>
<p>right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my
naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your toes are all cramped together. The other
print has each toe distinctly divided.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind.
Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-
window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I
shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my
hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I did as he directed, and was instantly con-
scious of a strong tarry smell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is where he put his foot in getting out.
If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will
have no difficulty. Now run down-stairs, loose the
dog, and look out for Blondin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the time that I got out into the grounds
Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see
him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very
slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind
a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared,
and then vanished once more upon the opposite
side. When I made my way round there I found
him seated at one of the corner eaves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That You, Watson?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;This is the place. What is that black thing
</p>
<p>down there?&#8221;
&#8220;A water-barrel.&#8221;
&#8220;Top on it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;No sign of a ladder?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;Confound the fellow! It&#8217;s a most break-neck
</p>
<p>place. I ought to be able to come down where he
</p>
<p>could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm.
Here goes, anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern
began to come steadily down the side of the wall.
Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel,
and from there to the earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was easy to follow him,&#8221; he said, drawing
on his stockings and boots. &#8220;Tiles were loosened
the whole way along, and in his hurry he had
dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you
doctors express it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The object which he held up to me was a small
pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and
with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape
and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside
were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at
one end and rounded at the other, like that which
had struck Bartholomew Sholto.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are hellish things,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Look out
that you don&#8217;t prick yourself. I&#8217;m delighted to
have them, for the chances are that they are all he
has. There is the less fear of you or me finding
one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a
Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile
trudge, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your leg will stand it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell
it, Toby, smell it!&#8221; He pushed the creasote hand-
kerchief under the dog&#8217;s nose, while the creature
stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a
most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur
sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage. Holmes
then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened
a stout cord to the mongrel&#8217;s collar, and let him to
the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly
broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps,
and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in
the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which
strained his leash and kept us at the top of our
speed.
</p>
<p>The east had been gradually whitening, and we
could now see some distance in the cold gray light.
The square, massive house, with its black, empty
windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad
and forlorn, behind us. Our course let right across
the grounds, in and out among the trenches and
pits with which they were scarred and intersected.
The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and
ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look
which harmonized with the black tragedy which
hung over it.
</p>
<p>88</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Episode of the Barrel
</p>
<p>On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along,
whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and
stopped finally in a corner screened by a young
beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks
had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn
down and rounded upon the lower side, as though
they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes
clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he
dropped it over upon the other side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the print of wooden-leg&#8217;s hand,&#8221; he
remarked, as I mounted up beside him. &#8220;You see
the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster.
What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very
heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon
the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours&#8217;
start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I confess that I had my doubts myself when I
reflected upon the great traffic which had passed
along the London road in the interval. My fears
were soon appeased, however. Toby never hes-
itated or swerved, but waddled on in his pecu-
liar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of
the creasote rose high above all other contending
scents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not imagine,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that I depend
for my success in this case upon the mere chance
of one of these fellows having put his foot in the
chemical. I have knowledge now which would
enable me to trace them in many different ways.
This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune
has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if
I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case
from becoming the pretty little intellectual prob-
lem which it at one time promised to be. There
might have been some credit to be gained out of it,
but for this too palpable clue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is credit, and to spare,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I as-
sure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by
which you obtain your results in this case, even
more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The
thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexpli-
cable. How, for example, could you describe with
such confidence the wooden-legged man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself.
I don&#8217;t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and
above-board. Two officers who are in command
of a convict-guard learn an important secret as
to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by
an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You re-
member that we saw the name upon the chart in
Captain Morstan&#8217;s possession. He had signed it
in behalf of himself and his associates,&#8212;the sign
of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called
it. Aided by this chart, the officers&#8212;or one of
</p>
<p>them&#8212;gets the treasure and brings it to England,
leaving, we will suppose, some condition under
which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why
did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?
The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time
when Morstan was brought into close association
with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the trea-
sure because he and his associates were themselves
convicts and could not get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is mere speculation,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis
</p>
<p>which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in
with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for
some years, happy in the possession of his trea-
sure. Then he receives a letter from India which
gives him a great fright. What was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A letter to say that the men whom he had
wronged had been set free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for
he would have known what their term of impris-
onment was. It would not have been a surprise
to him. What does he do then? He guards him-
self against a wooden-legged man,&#8212;a white man,
mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for
him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only
one white man&#8217;s name is on the chart. The oth-
ers are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no
other white man. Therefore we may say with con-
fidence that the wooden-legged man is identical
with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike yo
as being faulty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No: it is clear and concise.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of
</p>
<p>Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of
view. He comes to England with the double idea of
regaining what he would consider to be his rights
and of having his revenge upon the man who had
wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived,
and very possibly he established communications
with some one inside the house. There is this but-
ler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bern-
stone gives him far from a good character. Small
could not find out, however, where the treasure
was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major
and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly
Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In
a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him,
he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way
to the dying man&#8217;s window, and is only deterred
from entering by the presence of his two sons.
Mad with hate, however, against the dead man,
he enters the room that night, searches his private
papers in the hope of discovering some memoran-
dum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a
</p>
<p>89</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>momento of his visit in the short inscription upon
the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand
that should he slay the major he would leave some
such record upon the body as a sign that it was
not a common murder, but, from the point of view
of the four associates, something in the nature of
an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits
of this kind are common enough in the annals of
crime, and usually afford valuable indications as
to the criminal. Do you follow all this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very clearly.&#8221;
&#8220;Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He
</p>
<p>could only continue to keep a secret watch upon
the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly
he leaves England and only comes back at inter-
vals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and
he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the
presence of some confederate in the household.
Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable
to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto.
He takes with him, however, a rather curious as-
sociate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his
naked foot into creasote, whence come Toby, and a
six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged
tendo Achillis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was the associate, and not Jonathan,
who committed the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. And rather to Jonathan&#8217;s disgust,
to judge by the way the stamped about when he
got into the room. He bore no grudge against
Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if
he could have been simply bound and gagged. He
did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was
no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his
companion had broken out, and the poison had
done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record,
lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and fol-
lowed it himself. That was the train of events as
far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his
personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and
must be sunburned after serving his time in such
an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily
calculated from the length of his stride, and we
know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the
one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus
Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don&#8217;t
know that there is anything else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The associate?&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that.
</p>
<p>But you will know all about it soon enough. How
sweet the morning air is! See how that one little
cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic
flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself
over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good
</p>
<p>many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a
stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel
with our petty ambitions and strivings in the pres-
ence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are
you well up in your Jean Paul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly so. I worked back to him through Car-
lyle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was like following the brook to the par-
ent lake. He makes one curious but profound re-
mark. It is that the chief proof of man&#8217;s real great-
ness lies in his perception of his own smallness.
It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of
appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility.
There is much food for tho
