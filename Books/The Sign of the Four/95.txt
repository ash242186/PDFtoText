</p>
<p>time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his em-
barrassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What the deuce is the matter with the dog?&#8221;
growled Holmes. &#8220;They surely would not take a
cab, or go off in a balloon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they stood here for some time,&#8221; I sug-
gested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! it&#8217;s all right. He&#8217;s off again,&#8221; said my
companion, in a tone of relief.
</p>
<p>He was indeed off, for after sniffing round
again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted
away with an energy and determination such as he
had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much
hotter than before, for he had not even to put his
nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and
tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam
in Holmes&#8217;s eyes that he thought we were nearing
the end of our journey.
</p>
<p>Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we
came to Broderick and Nelson&#8217;s large timber-yard,
just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog,
frantic with excitement, turned down through the
side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers
were already at work. On the dog raced through
sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a pas-
sage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a
triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which
still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had
been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking
eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one
to the other of us for some sign of appreciation.
The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the
trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the
whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each
other, and then burst simultaneously into an un-
controllable fit of laughter.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.
The Baker Street Irregulars
</p>
<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Toby has lost his char-
acter for infallibility.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He acted according to his lights,&#8221; said
Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and
walking him out of the timber-yard. &#8220;If you con-
sider how much creasote is carted about London in
one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should
have been crossed. It is much used now, especially
for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to
blame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get on the main scent again, I sup-
pose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to
go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner
of Knight&#8217;s Place was that there were two different
trails running in opposite directions. We took the
wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no difficulty about this. On lead-
ing Toby to the place where he had committed
his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally
dashed off in a fresh direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must take care that he does not now bring
us to the place where the creasote-barrel came
from,&#8221; I observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought of that. But you notice that he
keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed
down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It tended down towards the river-side, running
through Belmont Place and Prince&#8217;s Street. At the
end of Broad Street it ran right down to the wa-
ter&#8217;s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf.
Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there
stood whining, looking out on the dark current be-
yond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are out of luck,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;They have
taken to a boat here.&#8221; Several small punts and
skiffs were lying about in the water and on the
edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in
turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no
sign.
</p>
<p>Close to the rude landing-stage was a small
brick house, with a wooden placard slung out
through the second window. &#8220;Mordecai Smith&#8221;
was printed across it in large letters, and, under-
neath, &#8220;Boats to hire by the hour or day.&#8221; A sec-
ond inscription above the door informed us that
a steam launch was kept,&#8212;a statement which was
</p>
<p>91</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty.
Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his
face assumed an ominous expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks bad,&#8221; said he. &#8220;These fellows are
sharper than I expected. They seem to have cov-
ered their tracks. There has, I fear, been precon-
certed management here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was approaching the door of the house,
when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of
six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-
faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You come back and be washed, Jack,&#8221; she
shouted. &#8220;Come back, you young imp; for if your
father comes home and finds you like that, he&#8217;ll let
us hear of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear little chap!&#8221; said Holmes, strategically.
&#8220;What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, Jack, is
there anything you would like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The youth pondered for a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;d like a
shillin&#8217;,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing you would like better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like two shillin&#8217; better,&#8221; the prodigy an-
swered, after some thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, then! Catch!&#8212;A fine child, Mrs.
Smith!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217; bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He
gets a&#8217;most too much for me to manage, &#8217;specially
when my man is away days at a time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Away, is he?&#8221; said Holmes, in a disappointed
voice. &#8220;I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak
to Mr. Smith.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been away since yesterday mornin&#8217;, sir,
and, truth to tell, I am beginnin&#8217; to feel frightened
about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I
could serve as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to hire his steam launch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch
that he has gone. That&#8217;s what puzzles me; for
I know there ain&#8217;t more coals in her than would
take her to about Woolwich and back. If he&#8217;d been
away in the barge I&#8217;d ha&#8217; thought nothin&#8217;; for many
a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend,
and then if there was much doin&#8217; there he might
ha&#8217; stayed over. But what good is a steam launch
without coals?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have bought some at a wharf down
the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He might, sir, but it weren&#8217;t his way. Many
a time I&#8217;ve heard him call out at the prices they
charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don&#8217;t like
that wooden-legged man, wi&#8217; his ugly face and
</p>
<p>outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin&#8217;
about here for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A wooden-legged man?&#8221; said Holmes, with
bland surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that&#8217;s
called more&#8217;n once for my old man. It was him
that roused him up yesternight, and, what&#8217;s more,
my man knew he was comin&#8217;, for he had steam up
in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don&#8217;t feel
easy in my mind about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mrs. Smith,&#8221; said Holmes,
shrugging his shoulders, &#8220;You are frightening
yourself about nothing. How could you possibly
tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came
in the night? I don&#8217;t quite understand how you
can be so sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which
is kind o&#8217; thick and foggy. He tapped at the
winder,&#8212;about three it would be. &#8216;Show a leg,
matey,&#8217; says he: &#8216;time to turn out guard.&#8217; My old
man woke up Jim,&#8212;that&#8217;s my eldest,&#8212;and away
they went, without so much as a word to me. I
could hear the wooden leg clackin&#8217; on the stones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And was this wooden-legged man alone?&#8221;
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t say, I am sure, sir. I didn&#8217;t hear no
</p>
<p>one else.&#8221;
&#8220;I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam
</p>
<p>launch, and I have heard good reports of the&#8212;Let
me see, what is her name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Aurora, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah! She&#8217;s not that old green launch with a
</p>
<p>yellow line, very broad in the beam?&#8221;
&#8220;No, indeed. She&#8217;s as trim a little thing as any
</p>
<p>on the river. She&#8217;s been fresh painted, black with
two red streaks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from
Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I
should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him
know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you
say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Black with a white band.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, of course. It was the sides which were
</p>
<p>black. Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.&#8212;There is a
boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall
take it and cross the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing with people of that sort,&#8221; said
Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, &#8220;is
never to let them think that their information can
be of the slightest importance to you. If you do,
they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you
listen to them under protest, as it were, you are
very likely to get what you want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our course now seems pretty clear,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>92</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Baker Street Irregulars
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do, then?&#8221;
&#8220;I would engage a launch and go down the
</p>
<p>river on the track of the Aurora.&#8221;
&#8220;My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task.
</p>
<p>She may have touched at any wharf on either side
of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below
the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-
places for miles. It would take you days and days
to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Employ the police, then.&#8221;
&#8220;No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in
</p>
<p>at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I
should not like to do anything which would injure
him professionally. But I have a fancy for working
it out myself, now that we have gone so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we advertise, then, asking for informa-
tion from wharfingers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse and worse! Our men would know that
the chase was hot at their heels, and they would
be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely
enough to leave, but as long as they think they are
perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones&#8217;s en-
ergy will be of use to us there, for his view of the
case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and
the runaways will think that every one is off on the
wrong scent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we to do, then?&#8221; I asked, as we
landed near Millbank Penitentiary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this hansom, drive home, have some
breakfast, and get an hour&#8217;s sleep. It is quite on
the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop
at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for
he may be of use to us yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-
office, and Holmes despatched his wire. &#8220;Whom
do you think that is to?&#8221; he asked, as we resumed
our journey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
&#8220;You remember the Baker Street division of the
</p>
<p>detective police force whom I employed in the Jef-
ferson Hope case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, laughing.
&#8220;This is just the case where they might be in-
</p>
<p>valuable. If they fail, I have other resources; but
I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty
little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and
his gang will be with us before we have finished
our breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was between eight and nine o&#8217;clock now, and
I was conscious of a strong reaction after the suc-
cessive excitements of the night. I was limp and
weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I
</p>
<p>had not the professional enthusiasm which carried
my companion on, nor could I look at the matter
as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as
the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard
little good of him, and could feel no intense antipa-
thy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a
different matter. That, or part of it, belonged right-
fully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of
recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the
one object. True, if I found it it would probably
put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be
a petty and selfish love which would be influenced
by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to
find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason
to urge me on to find the treasure.
</p>
<p>A bath at Baker Street and a complete change
freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down
to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes
pouring out the coffee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said he, laughing, and pointing to
an open newspaper. &#8220;The energetic Jones and the
ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them.
But you have had enough of the case. Better have
your ham and eggs first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I took the paper from him and read the short
notice, which was headed &#8220;Mysterious Business at
Upper Norwood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About twelve o&#8217;clock last night,&#8221; said
the Standard, &#8220;Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of
Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found
dead in his room under circumstances which point
to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual
traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto&#8217;s
person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems
which the deceased gentleman had inherited from
his father has been carried off. The discovery was
first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Wat-
son, who had called at the house with Mr. Thad-
deus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singu-
lar piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the
well-known member of the detective police force,
happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and
was on the ground within half an hour of the first
alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were
at once directed towards the detection of the crim-
inals, with the gratifying result that the brother,
Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, to-
gether with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an
Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gate-
keeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that
the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the
house, for Mr. Jones&#8217;s well-known technical knowl-
edge and his powers of minute observation have
enabled him to prove conclusively that the mis-
creants could not have entered by the door or by
</p>
<p>93</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>the window, but must have made their way across
the roof of the building, and so through a trap-
door into a room which communicated with that
in which the body was found. This fact, which
has been very clearly made out, proves conclu-
sively that it was no mere haphazard burglary.
The prompt and energetic action of the officers
of the law shows the great advantage of the pres-
ence on such occasions of a single vigorous and
masterful mind. We cannot but think that it sup-
plies an argument to those who would wish to see
our detectives more decentralized, and so brought
into closer and more effective touch with the cases
which it is their duty to investigate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it gorgeous!&#8221; said Holmes, grinning over
his coffee-cup. &#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we have had a close shave our-
selves of being arrested for the crime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I. I wouldn&#8217;t answer for our safety now,
if he should happen to have another of his attacks
of energy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment there was a loud ring at the
bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady,
raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dis-
may.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By heaven, Holmes,&#8221; I said, half rising, &#8220;I be-
lieve that they are really after us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not quite so bad as that. It is the un-
official force,&#8212;the Baker Street irregulars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of
naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices,
and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little
street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline
among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for
they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us
with expectant faces. One of their number, taller
and older than the others, stood forward with an
air of lounding superiority which was very funny
in such a disreputable little carecrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got your message, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and brought
&#8217;em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; said Holmes, producing some
silver. &#8220;In future they can report to you, Wiggins,
and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded
in this way. However, it is just as well that you
should all hear the instructions. I want to find the
whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora,
owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks,
funnel black with a white band. She is down the
river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Morde-
cai Smith&#8217;s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say
if the boat comes back. You must divide it out
among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly.
</p>
<p>Let me know the moment you have news. Is that
all clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; said Wiggins.
&#8220;The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy
</p>
<p>who finds the boat. Here&#8217;s a day in advance. Now
off you go!&#8221; He handed them a shilling each, and
away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them
a moment later streaming down the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the launch is above water they will find her,&#8221;
said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his
pipe. &#8220;They can go everywhere, see everything,
overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening
that they have spotted her. In the mean while, we
can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick
up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora
or Mr. Mordecai Smith.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are
you going to bed, Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No: I am not tired. I have a curious consti-
tution. I never remember feeling tired by work,
though idleness exhausts me completely. I am go-
ing to smoke and to think over this queer busi-
ness to which my fair client has introduced us. If
ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to
be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but
the other man must, I should think, be absolutely
unique.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That other man again!&#8221;
&#8220;I have no wish to make a mystery of him,&#8212;to
</p>
<p>you, anyway. But you must have formed your own
opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive
footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet,
stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small
poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A savage!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Perhaps one of
those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan
Small.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When first I saw signs
of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but
the remarkable character of the footmarks caused
me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabi-
tants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but
none could have left such marks as that. The Hin-
doo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-
wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well sep-
arated from the others, because the thong is com-
monly passed between. These little darts, too,
could only be shot in one way. They are from a
blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our
savage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;South American,&#8221; I hazarded.
He stretched his hand up, and took down a
</p>
<p>bulky volume from the shelf. &#8220;This is the first vol-
ume of a gazetteer which is now being published.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Break in the Chain
</p>
<p>It may be looked upon as the very latest author-
ity. What have we here? &#8216;Andaman Islands, situ-
ated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay
of Bengal.&#8217; Hum! hum! What&#8217;s all this? Moist
climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-
barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods&#8212;Ah, here
we are. &#8216;The aborigines of the Andaman Islands
may perhaps claim the distinction of being the
smallest race upon this earth, though some an-
thropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the
Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fue-
gians. The average height is rather below four feet,
although many full-grown adults may be found
who are very much smaller than this. They are a
fierce, morose, and intractable people, though ca-
pable of forming most devoted friendships when
their confidence has once been gained.&#8217; Mark that,
Watson. Now, then, listen to this. &#8216;They are nat-
urally hideous, having large, misshapen heads,
small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their
feet and hands, however, are remarkably small.
So intractable and fierce are they that all the ef-
forts of the British official have failed to win them
over in any degree. They have always been a terror
to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with
their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with
</p>
<p>their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invari-
ably concluded by a cannibal feast.&#8217; Nice, amiable
people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his
own unaided devices this affair might have taken
an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it
is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to
have employed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how came he to have so singular a com-
panion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, how-
ever, we had already determined that Small had
come from the Andamans, it is not so very won-
derful that this islander should be with him. No
doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look
here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down
there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.&#8221;
