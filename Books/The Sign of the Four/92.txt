</p>
<p>for. These could only be at the top of the build-
ing. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-
plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure
enough, he came upon another little garret above
it, which had been sealed up and was known to
no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, rest-
ing upon two rafters. He lowered it through the
hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of
the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the mention of this gigantic sum we all
stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan,
could we secure her rights, would change from a
needy governess to the richest heiress in England.
Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice
at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that self-
ishness took me by the soul, and that my heart
turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered
out some few halting words of congratulation,
</p>
<p>and then sat downcast, with my head drooped,
deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He
was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was
dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth in-
terminable trains of symptoms, and imploring in-
formation as to the composition and action of in-
numerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore
about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that
he may not remember any of the answers which I
gave him that night. Holmes declares that he over-
heard me caution him against the great danger of
taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I
recommended strychnine in large doses as a seda-
tive. However that may be, I was certainly relieved
when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coach-
man sprang down to open the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,&#8221;
said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge
</p>
<p>It was nearly eleven o&#8217;clock when we reached
this final stage of our night&#8217;s adventures. We had
left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and
the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from
the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly
across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasion-
ally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see
for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down
one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us
a better light upon our way.
</p>
<p>Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds,
and was girt round with a very high stone wall
topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-
clamped door formed the only means of en-
trance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar
postman-like rat-tat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; cried a gruff voice from within.
&#8220;It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock
</p>
<p>by this time.&#8221;
There was a grumbling sound and a clanking
</p>
<p>and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back,
and a short, deep-chested man stood in the open-
ing, with the yellow light of the lantern shining
upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the oth-
ers? I had no orders about them from the master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my
brother last night that I should bring some friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t been out o&#8217; his room to-day, Mr.
Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very
well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you
in, but your friends must just stop where they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus
Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and help-
less manner. &#8220;This is too bad of you, McMurdo!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If I guarantee them, that is enough for
you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait
on the public road at this hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,&#8221; said the porter, in-
exorably. &#8220;Folk may be friends o&#8217; yours, and yet
no friends o&#8217; the master&#8217;s. He pays me well to do
my duty, and my duty I&#8217;ll do. I don&#8217;t know none
o&#8217; your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,&#8221; cried Sherlock
Holmes, genially. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can have for-
gotten me. Don&#8217;t you remember the amateur who
fought three rounds with you at Alison&#8217;s rooms on
the night of your benefit four years back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>79</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!&#8221; roared the prize-
fighter. &#8220;God&#8217;s truth! how could I have mistook
you? If instead o&#8217; standin&#8217; there so quiet you had
just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of
yours under the jaw, I&#8217;d ha&#8217; known you without
a question. Ah, you&#8217;re one that has wasted your
gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you
had joined the fancy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still
one of the scientific professions open to me,&#8220; said
Holmes, laughing. &#8220;Our friend won&#8217;t keep us out
in the cold now, I am sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In you come, sir, in you come,&#8212;you and your
friends,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,
but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your
friends before I let them in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inside, a gravel path wound through deso-
late grounds to a huge clump of a house, square
and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a
moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in
a garret window. The vast size of the building,
with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill
to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at
ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There must
be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew
that we should be here, and yet there is no light in
his window. I do not know what to make of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he always guard the premises in this
way?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he has followed my father&#8217;s custom. He
was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes
think that my father may have told him more than
he ever told me. That is Bartholomew&#8217;s window
up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite
bright, but there is no light from within, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;But I see the glint of a
light in that little window beside the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that is the housekeeper&#8217;s room. That is
where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all
about it. But perhaps you would not mind wait-
ing here for a minute or two, for if we all go in
together and she has no word of our coming she
may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held up the lantern, and his hand shook
until the circles of light flickered and wavered all
round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and
we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our
ears. From the great black house there sounded
through the silent night the saddest and most piti-
ful of sounds,&#8212;the shrill, broken whimpering of a
frightened woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Mrs. Bernstone,&#8221; said Sholto. &#8220;She is the
only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be
back in a moment.&#8221; He hurried for the door, and
knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall
old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at
the very sight of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have
come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus,
sir!&#8221; We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the
door was closed and her voice died away into a
muffled monotone.
</p>
<p>Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes
swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the
house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cum-
bered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood to-
gether, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous
subtle thing is love, for here were we two who
had never seen each other before that day, between
whom no word or even look of affection had ever
passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our
hands instinctively sought for each other. I have
marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the
most natural thing that I should go out to her so,
and, as she has often told me, there was in her also
the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protec-
tion. So we stood hand in hand, like two children,
and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark
things that surrounded us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a strange place!&#8221; she said, looking
round.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as though all the moles in England
had been let loose in it. I have seen something of
the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where
the prospectors had been at work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And from the same cause,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You
must remember that they were six years looking
for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a
gravel-pit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment the door of the house burst
open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out,
with his hands thrown forward and terror in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something amiss with Bartholomew!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;I am frightened! My nerves cannot
stand it.&#8221; He was, indeed, half blubbering with
fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out
from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless
appealing expression of a terrified child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into the house,&#8221; said Holmes, in his
crisp, firm way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do!&#8221; pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. &#8220;I really
do not feel equal to giving directions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>80</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge
</p>
<p>We all followed him into the housekeeper&#8217;s
room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the
passage. The old woman was pacing up and down
with a scared look and restless picking fingers,
but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have
a soothing effect upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless your sweet calm face!&#8221; she cried,
with an hysterical sob. &#8220;It does me good to see
you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our companion patted her thin, work-worn
hand, and murmured some few words of kindly
womanly comfort which brought the color back
into the others bloodless cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Master has locked himself in and will now an-
swer me,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;All day I have waited to
hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but
an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so
I went up and peeped through the key-hole. You
must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,&#8212;you must go up and
look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew
Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but
I never saw him with such a face on him as that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the
way, for Thaddeus Sholto&#8217;s teeth were chattering
in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass
my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs,
for his knees were trembling under him. Twice
as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of
his pocket and carefully examined marks which
appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of
dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as
a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step,
holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to
right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind
with the frightened housekeeper.
</p>
<p>The third flight of stairs ended in a straight pas-
sage of some length, with a great picture in Indian
tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon
the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same
slow and methodical way, while we kept close at
his heels, with our long black shadows stream-
ing backwards down the corridor. The third door
was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked
without receiving any answer, and then tried to
turn the handle and force it open. It was locked
on the inside, however, and by a broad and pow-
erful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp
up against it. The key being turned, however, the
hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent
down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp
intaking of the breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something devilish in this, Watson,&#8221;
said he, more moved than I had ever before seen
him. &#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror.
Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was
bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Look-
ing straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in
the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung
a face,&#8212;the very face of our companion Thad-
deus. There was the same high, shining head, the
same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless
countenance. The features were set, however, in a
horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which
in that still and moonlit room was more jarring
to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like
was the face to that of our little friend that I looked
round at him to make sure that he was indeed with
us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned
to us that his brother and he were twins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is terrible!&#8221; I said to Holmes. &#8220;What is to
be done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The door must come down,&#8221; he answered,
and, springing against it, he put all his weight
upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not
yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once
more, and this time it gave way with a sudden
snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew
Sholto&#8217;s chamber.
</p>
<p>It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical
laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bot-
tles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door,
and the table was littered over with Bunsen burn-
ers, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood
carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these ap-
peared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream
of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and
the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-
like odor. A set of steps stood at one side of the
room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster,
and above them there was an opening in the ceil-
ing large enough for a man to pass through. At
the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown
carelessly together.
</p>
<p>By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the mas-
ter of the house was seated all in a heap, with
his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that
ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was
stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many
hours. It seemed to me that not only his features
but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the
most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table
there lay a peculiar instrument,&#8212;a brown, close-
grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer,
rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it
was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words
scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then
handed it to me.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Sign of the Four
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, with a significant raising of
the eyebrows.
</p>
<p>In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of
horror, &#8220;The sign of the four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, what does it all mean?&#8221; I
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means murder,&#8221; said he, stooping over the
dead man. &#8220;Ah, I expected it. Look here!&#8221; He
pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn
stuck in the skin just above the ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a thorn,
