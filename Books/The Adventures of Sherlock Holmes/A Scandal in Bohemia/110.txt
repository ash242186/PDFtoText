</p>
<p>&#8220;At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so
that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must
be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete
change in her life and habits. I must wire to the
King without delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had reached Baker Street and had stopped
at the door. He was searching his pockets for the
key when someone passing said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were several people on the pavement at
the time, but the greeting appeared to come from
a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that voice before,&#8221; said Holmes,
staring down the dimly lit street. &#8220;Now, I wonder
who the deuce that could have been.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were
engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning
when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have really got it!&#8221; he cried, grasping
Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking
eagerly into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;
&#8220;But you have hopes?&#8221;
&#8220;I have hopes.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.&#8221;
&#8220;We must have a cab.&#8221;
&#8220;No, my brougham is waiting.&#8221;
&#8220;Then that will simplify matters.&#8221; We de-
</p>
<p>scended and started off once more for Briony
Lodge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Irene Adler is married,&#8221; remarked Holmes.
&#8220;Married! When?&#8221;
&#8220;Yesterday.&#8221;
&#8220;But to whom?&#8221;
&#8220;To an English lawyer named Norton.&#8221;
&#8220;But she could not love him.&#8221;
&#8220;I am in hopes that she does.&#8221;
&#8220;And why in hopes?&#8221;
&#8220;Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of
</p>
<p>future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband,
she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love
your Majesty, there is no reason why she should
interfere with your Majesty&#8217;s plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true. And yet&#8212;Well! I wish she had been
of my own station! What a queen she would have
made!&#8221; He relapsed into a moody silence, which
was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine
Avenue.
</p>
<p>The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an el-
derly woman stood upon the steps. She watched
us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
brougham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Holmes,&#8221; answered my companion,
looking at her with a questioning and rather star-
tled gaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! My mistress told me that you were
likely to call. She left this morning with her hus-
band by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for the
Continent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Sherlock Holmes staggered back,
white with chagrin and surprise. &#8220;Do you mean
that she has left England?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never to return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the papers?&#8221; asked the King hoarsely.
&#8220;All is lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see.&#8221; He pushed past the servant
and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by
the King and myself. The furniture was scattered
about in every direction, with dismantled shelves
and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ran-
sacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at
the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and
a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler her-
self in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
&#8220;Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.&#8221;
My friend tore it open and we all three read it to-
gether. It was dated at midnight of the preceding
night and ran in this way:
</p>
<p>132</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:
&#8220;You really did it very well. You
</p>
<p>took me in completely. Until after the
alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.
But then, when I found how I had be-
trayed myself, I began to think. I had
been warned against you months ago.
I had been told that if the King em-
ployed an agent it would certainly be
you. And your address had been given
me. Yet, with all this, you made me re-
veal what you wanted to know. Even
after I became suspicious, I found it
hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
old clergyman. But, you know, I have
been trained as an actress myself. Male
costume is nothing new to me. I often
take advantage of the freedom which
it gives. I sent John, the coachman,
to watch you, ran up stairs, got into
my walking-clothes, as I call them, and
came down just as you departed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I followed you to your door,
and so made sure that I was really an
object of interest to the celebrated Mr.
Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather im-
prudently, wished you good-night, and
started for the Temple to see my hus-
band.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We both thought the best resource
was flight, when pursued by so
formidable an antagonist; so you will
find the nest empty when you call to-
morrow. As to the photograph, your
client may rest in peace. I love and
am loved by a better man than he.
The King may do what he will with-
out hindrance from one whom he has
cruelly wronged. I keep it only to
safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me
from any steps which he might take in
the future. I leave a photograph which
he might care to possess; and I remain,
dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very truly yours,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Irene Norton, ne&#180;e Adler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a woman&#8212;oh, what a woman!&#8221; cried
the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read
this epistle. &#8220;Did I not tell you how quick and
resolute she was? Would she not have made an
admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not
on my level?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I have seen of the lady she seems
indeed to be on a very different level to your
Majesty,&#8221; said Holmes coldly. &#8220;I am sorry that I
have not been able to bring your Majesty&#8217;s busi-
ness to a more successful conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, my dear sir,&#8221; cried the King;
&#8220;nothing could be more successful. I know that
her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
safe as if it were in the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me
in what way I can reward you. This ring&#8212;&#8221; He
slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
held it out upon the palm of his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty has something which I should
value even more highly,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have but to name it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This photograph!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The King stared at him in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Irene&#8217;s photograph!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Certainly, if
you wish it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more
to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish
you a very good-morning.&#8221; He bowed, and, turn-
ing away without observing the hand which the
King had stretched out to him, he set off in my
company for his chambers.
</p>
<p>And that was how a great scandal threatened
to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the
best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by
a woman&#8217;s wit. He used to make merry over the
cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do
it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or
when he refers to her photograph, it is always un-
der the honourable title of the woman.</p>
