</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she has said that she would send it
on the day when the betrothal was publicly pro-
claimed. That will be next Monday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then we have three days yet,&#8221; said Holmes
with a yawn. &#8220;That is very fortunate, as I have one
or two matters of importance to look into just at
present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in Lon-
don for the present?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham
under the name of the Count Von Kramm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know
how we progress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, as to money?&#8221;
&#8220;You have carte blanche.&#8221;
&#8220;Absolutely?&#8221;
&#8220;I tell you that I would give one of the
</p>
<p>provinces of my kingdom to have that photo-
graph.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And for present expenses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The King took a heavy chamois leather bag
from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three hundred pounds in gold and
seven hundred in notes,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his
note-book and handed it to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mademoiselle&#8217;s address?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John&#8217;s
Wood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes took a note of it. &#8220;One other question,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Was the photograph a cabinet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust
that we shall soon have some good news for you.
And good-night, Watson,&#8221; he added, as the wheels
of the royal brougham rolled down the street. &#8220;If
you will be good enough to call to-morrow after-
noon at three o&#8217;clock I should like to chat this little
matter over with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>At three o&#8217;clock precisely I was at Baker Street,
but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady
informed me that he had left the house shortly af-
ter eight o&#8217;clock in the morning. I sat down be-
side the fire, however, with the intention of await-
ing him, however long he might be. I was already
deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
surrounded by none of the grim and strange fea-
tures which were associated with the two crimes
which I have already recorded, still, the nature of
the case and the exalted station of his client gave it
a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the na-
ture of the investigation which my friend had on
hand, there was something in his masterly grasp
of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning,
which made it a pleasure to me to study his sys-
tem of work, and to follow the quick, subtle meth-
ods by which he disentangled the most inextrica-
ble mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invari-
able success that the very possibility of his failing
had ceased to enter into my head.
</p>
<p>It was close upon four before the door opened,
and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-
</p>
<p>whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable
clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I
was to my friend&#8217;s amazing powers in the use of
disguises, I had to look three times before I was
certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he van-
ished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five
minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out
his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for
some minutes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, really!&#8221; he cried, and then he choked
and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back,
limp and helpless, in the chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite too funny. I am sure you could never
</p>
<p>guess how I employed my morning, or what I
ended by doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine. I suppose that you have been
watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of
Miss Irene Adler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I
will tell you, however. I left the house a little af-
ter eight o&#8217;clock this morning in the character of a
</p>
<p>127</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Scandal in Bohemia
</p>
<p>groom out of work. There is a wonderful sym-
pathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be
one of them, and you will know all that there is
to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou
villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in
front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side,
well furnished, with long windows almost to the
floor, and those preposterous English window fas-
teners which a child could open. Behind there was
nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house.
I walked round it and examined it closely from ev-
ery point of view, but without noting anything else
of interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I then lounged down the street and found, as
I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which
runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the
ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and
received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and
half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much infor-
mation as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say
nothing of half a dozen other people in the neigh-
bourhood in whom I was not in the least inter-
ested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
listen to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what of Irene Adler?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she has turned all the men&#8217;s heads down
in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bon-
net on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to
a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp
for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except
when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but
a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and
dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often
twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner
Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a con-
fidant. They had driven him home a dozen times
from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all they had to tell, I be-
gan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This Godfrey Norton was evidently an impor-
tant factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That
sounded ominous. What was the relation between
them, and what the object of his repeated visits?
Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
former, she had probably transferred the photo-
graph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely.
On the issue of this question depended whether
I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or
turn my attention to the gentleman&#8217;s chambers in
the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened
</p>
<p>the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with
these details, but I have to let you see my little dif-
ficulties, if you are to understand the situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am following you closely,&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still balancing the matter in my mind
when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge,
and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remark-
ably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mous-
tached&#8212;evidently the man of whom I had heard.
He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the
cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who
opened the door with the air of a man who was
thoroughly at home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in the house about half an hour, and
I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of
the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking ex-
citedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more
flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab,
he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked
at it earnestly, &#8216;Drive like the devil,&#8217; he shouted,
&#8216;first to Gross &amp; Hankey&#8217;s in Regent Street, and
then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware
Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty min-
utes!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Away they went, and I was just wondering
whether I should not do well to follow them when
up the lane came a neat little landau, the coach-
man with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie
under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were
sticking out of the buckles. It hadn&#8217;t pulled up be-
fore she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she
was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might
die for.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;The Church of St. Monica, John,&#8217; she cried,
&#8216;and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty min-
utes.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I
was just balancing whether I should run for it, or
whether I should perch behind her landau when
a cab came through the street. The driver looked
twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before
he could object. &#8216;The Church of St. Monica,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty min-
utes.&#8217; It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of
course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My cabby drove fast. I don&#8217;t think I ever drove
faster, but the others were there before us. The cab
and the landau with their steaming horses were
in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the
man and hurried into the church. There was not a
soul there save the two whom I had followed and
</p>
<p>128</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Chapter II
</p>
<p>a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostu-
lating with them. They were all three standing in
a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the
altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came
running as hard as he could towards me.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Thank God,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;You&#8217;ll do. Come!
Come!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What then?&#8217; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it
won&#8217;t be legal.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was half-dragged up to the altar, and be-
fore I knew where I was I found myself mumbling
responses which were whispered in my ear, and
vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and
generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene
Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It
was all done in an instant, and there was the gen-
tleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me
in front. It was the most preposterous position in
which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the
thought of it that started me laughing just now. It
seems that there had been some informality about
their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
to marry them without a witness of some sort, and
that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
from having to sally out into the streets in search
of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and
I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory
of the occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,&#8221; said
I; &#8220;and what then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I found my plans very seriously men-
aced. It looked as if the pair might take an imme-
diate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
and energetic measures on my part. At the church
door, however, they separated, he driving back to
the Temple, and she to her own house. &#8216;I shall
drive out in the park at five as usual,&#8217; she said as
she left him. I heard no more. They drove away
in different directions, and I went off to make my
own arrangements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some cold beef and a glass of beer,&#8221; he an-
swered, ringing the bell. &#8220;I have been too busy
to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your
co-operation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind breaking the law?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least.&#8221;
&#8220;Nor running a chance of arrest?&#8221;
&#8220;Not in a good cause.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, the cause is excellent!&#8221;
&#8220;Then I am your man.&#8221;
&#8220;I was sure that I might rely on you.&#8221;
&#8220;But what is it you wish?&#8221;
&#8220;When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I
</p>
<p>will make it clear to you. Now,&#8221; he said as he
turned hungrily on the simple fare that our land-
lady had provided, &#8220;I must discuss it while I eat,
for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In
two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss
Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what then?&#8221;
&#8220;You must leave that to me. I have already ar-
</p>
<p>ranged what is to occur. There is only one point on
which I must insist. You must not interfere, come
what may. You understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to be neutral?&#8221;
&#8220;To do nothing whatever. There will probably
</p>
<p>be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it.
It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room
window will open. You are to station yourself
close to that open window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;You are to watch me, for I will be visible to
</p>
<p>you.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;And when I raise my hand&#8212;so&#8212;you will
</p>
<p>throw into the room what I give you to throw, and
will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
quite follow me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely.&#8221;
&#8220;It is nothing very formidable,&#8221; he said, tak-
</p>
<p>ing a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. &#8220;It is
an ordinary plumber&#8217;s smoke-rocket, fitted with a
cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task
is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
You may then walk to the end of the street, and I
will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have
made myself clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to remain neutral, to get near the win-
dow, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in
this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait
you at the corner of the street.&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you may entirely rely on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>129</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>A Scandal in Bohemia
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost
time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He disappeared into his bedroom and returned
in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and
simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His
broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie,
his sympathetic smile, and general look of peer-
ing and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John
Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely
that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,
his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with ev-
ery fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner,
when he became a specialist in crime.
</p>
<p>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker
Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour
when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.
It was already dusk, and the lamps were just be-
ing lighted as we paced up and down in front of
Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occu-
pant. The house was just such as I had pictured
it from Sherlock Holmes&#8217; succinct description, but
the locality appeared to be less private than I ex-
pected. On the contrary, for a small street in a
quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated.
There was a group of shabbily dressed men smok-
ing and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder
with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting
with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young
men who were lounging up and down with cigars
in their mouths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; remarked Holmes, as we paced to
and fro in front of the house, &#8220;this marriage rather
simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a
double-edged weapon now. The chances are that
she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr.
Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to
the eyes of his princess. Now the question is,
Where are we to find the photograph?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, indeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is most unlikely that she carries it about
with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy
concealment about a woman&#8217;s dress. She knows
that the King is capable of having her waylaid and
searched. Two attempts of the sort have already
been made. We may take it, then, that she does
not carry it about with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her banker or her lawyer. There is that dou-
ble possibility. But I am inclined to think neither.
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do
their own secreting. Why should she hand it over
</p>
<p>to anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-
ship, but she could not tell what indirect or po-
litical influence might be brought to bear upon a
business man. Besides, remember that she had
resolved to use it within a few days. It must be
where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in
her own house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it has twice been burgled.&#8221;
&#8220;Pshaw! They did not know how to look.&#8221;
&#8220;But how will you look?&#8221;
&#8220;I will not look.&#8221;
&#8220;What then?&#8221;
&#8220;I will get her to show me.&#8221;
&#8220;But she will refuse.&#8221;
&#8220;She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble
</p>
<p>of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my
orders to the letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a
carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It
was a smart little landau which rattled up to the
door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the
loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open
the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was
elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed
up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke
out, which was increased by the two guardsmen,
who took sides with one of the loungers, and by
the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the
other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant
the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling
men, who struck savagely at each other with their
fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd
to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he
gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the
blood running freely down his face. At his fall
the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction
and the loungers in the other, while a number of
better-dressed people, who had watched the scuf-
fle without taking part in it, crowded in to help
the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene
Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the
steps; but she stood at the top with her superb fig-
ure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
back into the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the poor gentleman much hurt?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; cried several voices.
&#8220;No, no, there&#8217;s life in him!&#8221; shouted another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll be gone before you can get him to hos-
pital.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a brave fellow,&#8221; said a woman. &#8220;They
would have had the lady&#8217;s purse and watch if it
hadn&#8217;t been for him. They were a gang, and a
rough one, too. Ah, he&#8217;s breathing now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>130</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Chapter II
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t lie in the street. May we bring him
in, marm?&#8220;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There
is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!&#8220;
</p>
<p>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony
Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I
still observed the proceedings from my post by the
window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds
had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as
he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he
was seized with compunction at that moment for
the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt
more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than
when I saw the beautiful creature against whom
I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with
which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it
would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw
back now from the part which he had intrusted to
me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-
rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought,
we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her
from injuring another.
</p>
<p>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw
him motion like a man who is in need of air. A
maid rushed across and threw open the window.
At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and
at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with
a cry of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; The word was no sooner out of my
mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well
dressed and ill&#8212;gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-
maids&#8212;joined in a general shriek of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; Thick
clouds of smoke curled through the room and
out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of
rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of
Holmes from within assuring them that it was a
false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd
I made my way to the corner of the street, and in
ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend&#8217;s arm in
mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He
walked swiftly and in silence for some few min-
utes until we had turned down one of the quiet
streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did it very nicely, Doctor,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Nothing could have been better. It is all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the photograph?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you find out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She showed me, as I told you she would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still in the dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wish to make a mystery,&#8221; said he,
laughing. &#8220;The matter was perfectly simple. You,
of course, saw that everyone in the street was
</p>
<p>an accomplice. They were all engaged for the
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed as much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, when the row broke out, I had a little
moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed
forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face,
and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.&#8221;
