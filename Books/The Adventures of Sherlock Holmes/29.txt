<p>hen I glance over my notes and
records of the Sherlock Holmes cases
between the years &#8217;82 and &#8217;90, I
am faced by so many which present
</p>
<p>strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to
leave. Some, however, have already gained public-
ity through the papers, and others have not offered
a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the
object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have
baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narra-
tives, beginnings without an ending, while others
have been but partially cleared up, and have their
explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which
was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these
last which was so remarkable in its details and so
startling in its results that I am tempted to give
some account of it in spite of the fact that there
are points in connection with it which never have
been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared
up.
</p>
<p>The year &#8217;87 furnished us with a long series
of cases of greater or less interest, of which I re-
tain the records. Among my headings under this
one twelve months I find an account of the adven-
ture of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Men-
dicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the
lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
connected with the loss of the British barque &#8220;So-
phy Anderson&#8221;, of the singular adventures of the
Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally
of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as
may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able,
by winding up the dead man&#8217;s watch, to prove
that it had been wound up two hours before, and
that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within
that time&#8212;a deduction which was of the greatest
importance in clearing up the case. All these I may
sketch out at some future date, but none of them
present such singular features as the strange train
of circumstances which I have now taken up my
pen to describe.
</p>
<p>It was in the latter days of September, and the
equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional vi-
olence. All day the wind had screamed and the
rain had beaten against the windows, so that even
here in the heart of great, hand-made London we
were forced to raise our minds for the instant from
the routine of life and to recognise the presence
of those great elemental forces which shriek at
mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in,
the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind
</p>
<p>cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sher-
lock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fire-
place cross-indexing his records of crime, while I
at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell&#8217;s fine
sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without
seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of
the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the
sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother&#8217;s,
and for a few days I was a dweller once more in
my old quarters at Baker Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said I, glancing up at my companion,
&#8220;that was surely the bell. Who could come to-
night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Except yourself I have none,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I
do not encourage visitors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A client, then?&#8221;
&#8220;If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would
</p>
<p>bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour.
But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony
of the landlady&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture,
however, for there came a step in the passage and a
tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm
to turn the lamp away from himself and towards
the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; said he.
The man who entered was young, some two-
</p>
<p>and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and
trimly clad, with something of refinement and
delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand, and his long shin-
ing waterproof told of the fierce weather through
which he had come. He looked about him anx-
iously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that
his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of
a man who is weighed down with some great anx-
iety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe you an apology,&#8221; he said, raising his
golden pince-nez to his eyes. &#8220;I trust that I am not
intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of
the storm and rain into your snug chamber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your coat and umbrella,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;They may rest here on the hook and
will be dry presently. You have come up from the
south-west, I see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, from Horsham.&#8221;
&#8220;That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon
</p>
<p>your toe caps is quite distinctive.&#8221;
&#8220;I have come for advice.&#8221;
&#8220;That is easily got.&#8221;
&#8220;And help.&#8221;
&#8220;That is not always so easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>175</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Five Orange Pips
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard
from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the
Tankerville Club scandal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of
cheating at cards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that you could solve anything.&#8221;
&#8220;He said too much.&#8221;
&#8220;That you are never beaten.&#8221;
&#8220;I have been beaten four times&#8212;three times by
</p>
<p>men, and once by a woman.&#8221;
&#8220;But what is that compared with the number
</p>
<p>of your successes?&#8221;
&#8220;It is true that I have been generally success-
</p>
<p>ful.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you may be so with me.&#8221;
&#8220;I beg that you will draw your chair up to the
</p>
<p>fire and favour me with some details as to your
case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no ordinary one.&#8221;
&#8220;None of those which come to me are. I am the
</p>
<p>last court of appeal.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your
</p>
<p>experience, you have ever listened to a more mys-
terious and inexplicable chain of events than those
which have happened in my own family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You fill me with interest,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Pray
give us the essential facts from the commence-
ment, and I can afterwards question you as to
those details which seem to me to be most impor-
tant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man pulled his chair up and pushed
his wet feet out towards the blaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is John Openshaw, but
my own affairs have, as far as I can understand,
little to do with this awful business. It is a heredi-
tary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the
facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
affair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must know that my grandfather had two
sons&#8212;my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My
father had a small factory at Coventry, which he
enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling.
He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable
tire, and his business met with such success that he
was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome
competence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he
was a young man and became a planter in Florida,
where he was reported to have done very well. At
the time of the war he fought in Jackson&#8217;s army,
and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be
</p>
<p>a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle
returned to his plantation, where he remained for
three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex,
near Horsham. He had made a very considerable
fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving
them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dis-
like of the Republican policy in extending the fran-
chise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and
quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was
angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During
all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt
if ever he set foot in the town. He had a gar-
den and two or three fields round his house, and
there he would take his exercise, though very often
for weeks on end he would never leave his room.
He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
heavily, but he would see no society and did not
want any friends, not even his own brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy
to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was
a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the
year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
in England. He begged my father to let me live
with him and he was very kind to me in his way.
When he was sober he used to be fond of play-
ing backgammon and draughts with me, and he
would make me his representative both with the
servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the
time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the
house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not dis-
turb him in his privacy. There was one singular
exception, however, for he had a single room, a
lumber-room up among the attics, which was in-
variably locked, and which he would never permit
either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy&#8217;s cu-
riosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I
was never able to see more than such a collection
of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in
such a room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day&#8212;it was in March, 1883&#8212;a letter with
a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the
colonel&#8217;s plate. It was not a common thing for him
to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready
money, and he had no friends of any sort. &#8216;From
India!&#8217; said he as he took it up, &#8216;Pondicherry post-
mark! What can this be?&#8217; Opening it hurriedly, out
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which
pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh
at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at
the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes
were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and
he glared at the envelope which he still held in his
</p>
<p>176</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>trembling hand, &#8216;K. K. K.!&#8217; he shrieked, and then,
&#8216;My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What is it, uncle?&#8217; I cried.
&#8220; &#8216;Death,&#8217; said he, and rising from the table he
</p>
<p>retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with
horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled
in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum,
the letter K three times repeated. There was noth-
ing else save the five dried pips. What could be
the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the
breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met
him coming down with an old rusty key, which
must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and
a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;They may do what they like, but I&#8217;ll check-
mate them still,&#8217; said he with an oath. &#8216;Tell Mary
that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send
down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer ar-
rived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire
was burning brightly, and in the grate there was
a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper,
while the brass box stood open and empty beside
it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start,
that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I
had read in the morning upon the envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I wish you, John,&#8217; said my uncle, &#8216;to witness
my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages
and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your fa-
ther, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If
you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you
find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave
it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you
such a two-edged thing, but I can&#8217;t say what turn
things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
where Mr. Fordham shows you.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer
took it away with him. The singular incident
made, as you may think, the deepest impression
upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it ev-
ery way in my mind without being able to make
anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague
feeling of dread which it left behind, though the
sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and
nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of
our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, how-
ever. He drank more than ever, and he was less
inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time
he would spend in his room, with the door locked
upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge
in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out
of the house and tear about the garden with a
revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was
afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped
</p>
<p>up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When
these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it
behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no
longer against the terror which lies at the roots of
his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even
on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
were new raised from a basin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr.
Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there
came a night when he made one of those drunken
sallies from which he never came back. We found
him, when we went to search for him, face down-
ward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of
any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
so that the jury, having regard to his known ec-
centricity, brought in a verdict of &#8216;suicide.&#8217; But I,
who knew how he winced from the very thought
of death, had much ado to persuade myself that
he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter
passed, however, and my father entered into pos-
session of the estate, and of some &#163;14,000, which
lay to his credit at the bank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; Holmes interposed, &#8220;your
statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable
to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date
of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the
date of his supposed suicide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His
death was seven weeks later, upon the night of
May 2nd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Pray proceed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When my father took over the Horsham prop-
erty, he, at my request, made a careful examina-
tion of the attic, which had been always locked
up. We found the brass box there, although its
contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the
cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.
K. repeated upon it, and &#8216;Letters, memoranda, re-
ceipts, and a register&#8217; written beneath. These, we
presume, indicated the nature of the papers which
had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the
rest, there was nothing of much importance in the
attic save a great many scattered papers and note-
books bearing upon my uncle&#8217;s life in America.
Some of them were of the war time and showed
that he had done his duty well and had borne the
repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date
during the reconstruction of the Southern states,
and were mostly concerned with politics, for he
had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the
carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down
from the North.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Five Orange Pips
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was the beginning of &#8217;84 when my fa-
ther came to live at Horsham, and all went as well
as possible with us until the January of &#8217;85. On
the fourth day after the new year I heard my fa-
ther give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together
at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a
newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other
one. He had always laughed at what he called
my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he
looked very scared and puzzled now that the same
thing had come upon himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Why, what on earth does this mean, John?&#8217;
he stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart had turned to lead. &#8216;It is K. K. K.,&#8217;
said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked inside the envelope. &#8216;So it is,&#8217; he
cried. &#8216;Here are the very letters. But what is this
written above them?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Put the papers on the sundial,&#8217; I read, peep-
ing over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;What papers? What sundial?&#8217; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8217;&#8220; &#8216;The sundial in the garden. There is no other,
said I; &#8216;but the papers must be those that are de-
stroyed.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Pooh!&#8217; said he, gripping hard at his courage.
&#8216;We are in a civilised land here, and we can&#8217;t have
tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing
come from?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;From Dundee,&#8217; I answered, glancing at the
postmark.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Some preposterous practical joke,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;What have I to do with sundials and papers? I
shall take no notice of such nonsense.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;I should certainly speak to the police,&#8217; I said.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of
the sort.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Then let me do so?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;No, I forbid you. I won&#8217;t have a fuss made
about such nonsense.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a
very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a
heart which was full of forebodings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the third day after the coming of the letter
my father went from home to visit an old friend
of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one
of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that
he should go, for it seemed to me that he was far-
ther from danger when he was away from home.
In that, however, I was in error. Upon the sec-
ond day of his absence I received a telegram from
</p>
<p>the major, imploring me to come at once. My
father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits
which abound in the neighbourhood, and was ly-
ing senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried
to him, but he passed away without having ever
recovered his consciousness. He had, as it ap-
pears, been returning from Fareham in the twi-
light, and as the country was unknown to him,
and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hes-
itation in bringing in a verdict of &#8216;death from ac-
cidental causes.&#8217; Carefully as I examined every
fact connected with his death, I was unable to find
anything which could suggest the idea of murder.
There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen
upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that
my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-
nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven
round him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this sinister way I came into my inheritance.
You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I an-
swer, because I was well convinced that our trou-
bles were in some way dependent upon an inci-
dent in my uncle&#8217;s life, and that the danger would
be as pressing in one house as in another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in January, &#8217;85, that my poor father
met his end, and two years and eight months have
elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family, and
that it had ended with the last generation. I had
begun to take comfort too soon, however; yester-
day morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father.&#8220;
</p>
<p>The young man took from his waistcoat a
crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he
shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the envelope,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The
postmark is London&#8212;eastern division. Within are
the very words which were upon my father&#8217;s last
message: &#8216;K. K. K.&#8217;; and then &#8216;Put the papers on
the sundial.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth&#8221;&#8212;he sank his face into his
thin, white hands&#8212;&#8220;I have felt helpless. I have felt
like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is
writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of
some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against.&#8221;
</p>
<p>178</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; cried Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;You must
act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can
save you. This is no time for despair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen the police.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
&#8220;But they listened to my story with a smile. I
</p>
<p>am convinced that the inspector has formed the
opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and
that the deaths of my relations were really acci-
dents, as the jury stated, and were not to be con-
nected with the warnings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air.
&#8220;Incredible imbecility!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have, however, allowed me a policeman,
who may remain in the house with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he come with you to-night?&#8221;
&#8220;No. His orders were to stay in the house.&#8221;
Again Holmes raved in the air.
&#8220;Why did you come to me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and,
</p>
<p>above all, why did you not come at once?&#8221;
&#8220;I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke
</p>
<p>to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was
advised by him to come to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really two days since you had the letter.
We should have acted before this. You have no
further evidence, I suppose, than that which you
have placed before us&#8212;no suggestive detail which
might help us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing,&#8221; said John Openshaw. He
rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a
piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it
out upon the table. &#8220;I have some remembrance,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that on the day when my uncle burned
the papers I observed that the small, unburned
margins which lay amid the ashes were of this par-
ticular colour. I found this single sheet upon the
floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that
it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
fluttered out from among the others, and in that
way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention
of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
myself that it is a page from some private diary.
The writing is undoubtedly my uncle&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent
over the sheet of paper, which showed by its
ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a
book. It was headed, &#8220;March, 1869,&#8221; and beneath
were the following enigmatical notices:
4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
</p>
<p>John Swain, of St. Augustine.
9th. McCauley cleared.
</p>
<p>10th. John Swain cleared.
12th. Visited Paramore. All well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Holmes, folding up the pa-
per and returning it to our visitor. &#8220;And now you
must on no account lose another instant. We can-
not spare time even to discuss what you have told
me. You must get home instantly and act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;
&#8220;There is but one thing to do. It must be done
</p>
<p>at once. You must put this piece of paper which
you have shown us into the brass box which you
have described. You must also put in a note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your un-
cle, and that this is the only one which remains.
You must assert that in such words as will carry
conviction with them. Having done this, you must
at once put the box out upon the sundial, as di-
rected. Do you understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely.&#8221;
&#8220;Do not think of revenge, or anything of the
</p>
<p>sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by
means of the law; but we have our web to weave,
while theirs is already woven. The first considera-
tion is to remove the pressing danger which threat-
ens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and
to punish the guilty parties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said the young man, rising and
pulling on his overcoat. &#8220;You have given me fresh
life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take
care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not
think that there can be a doubt that you are threat-
ened by a very real and imminent danger. How do
you go back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By train from Waterloo.&#8221;
&#8220;It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded,
</p>
<p>so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you
cannot guard yourself too closely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am armed.&#8221;
&#8220;That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work
</p>
<p>upon your case.&#8221;
&#8220;I shall see you at Horsham, then?&#8221;
&#8220;No, your secret lies in London. It is there that
</p>
<p>I shall seek it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two
</p>
<p>days, with news as to the box and the papers.
I shall take your advice in every particular.&#8221; He
shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and
pattered against the windows. This strange, wild
story seemed to have come to us from amid the
mad elements&#8212;blown in upon us like a sheet of
</p>

<p>sea-weed in a gale&#8212;and now to have been reab-
sorbed by them once more.
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence,
with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon
the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe,
and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the
ceiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Watson,&#8221; he remarked at last, &#8220;that of
all our cases we have had none more fantastic than
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this
John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid
even greater perils than did the Sholtos.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But have you,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;formed any definite
conception as to what these perils are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no question as to their nature,&#8221;
he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and
why does he pursue this unhappy family?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his
elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-
tips together. &#8220;The ideal reasoner,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;would, when he had once been shown a single
fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all
the chain of events which led up to it but also all
the results which would follow from it. As Cu-
vier could correctly describe a whole animal by
the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer
who has thoroughly understood one link in a se-
ries of incidents should be able to accurately state
all the other ones, both before and after. We have
not yet grasped the results which the reason alone
can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a so-
lution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art,
however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that
the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
which have come to his knowledge; and this in it-
self implies, as you will readily see, a possession
of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free
education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare
accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however,
that a man should possess all knowledge which is
likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I
have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember
rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of
our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise
fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, laughing. &#8220;It was a singu-
lar document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics
</p>
<p>were marked at zero, I remember. Botany vari-
able, geology profound as regards the mud-stains
from any region within fifty miles of town, chem-
istry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational
literature and crime records unique, violin-player,
boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by co-
caine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main
points of my analysis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes grinned at the last item. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I say now, as I said then, that a man should
keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furni-
ture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put
away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the
one which has been submitted to us to-night, we
need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly
hand me down the letter K of the &#8216;American En-
cyclopaedia&#8217; which stands upon the shelf beside
you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situa-
tion and see what may be deduced from it. In the
first place, we may start with a strong presumption
that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong rea-
son for leaving America. Men at his time of life do
not change all their habits and exchange willingly
the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life
of an English provincial town. His extreme love
of solitude in England suggests the idea that he
was in fear of someone or something, so we may
assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear
of someone or something which drove him from
America. As to what it was he feared, we can only
deduce that by considering the formidable letters
which were received by himself and his successors.
Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first was from Pondicherry, the second
from Dundee, and the third from London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From East London. What do you deduce from
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all seaports. That the writer was on
board of a ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent. We have already a clue. There can
be no doubt that the probability&#8212;the strong prob-
ability&#8212;is that the writer was on board of a ship.
And now let us consider another point. In the case
of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the
threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only
some three or four days. Does that suggest any-
thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A greater distance to travel.&#8221;
&#8220;But the letter had also a greater distance to
</p>
<p>come.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I do not see the point.&#8221;
&#8220;There is at least a presumption that the vessel
</p>
<p>in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It
</p>
<p>180</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>looks as if they always send their singular warn-
ing or token before them when starting upon their
mission. You see how quickly the deed followed
the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had
come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would
have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as
a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that
those seven weeks represented the difference be-
tween the mail-boat which brought the letter and
the sailing vessel which brought the writer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More than that. It is probable. And now you
see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I
urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has
always fallen at the end of the time which it would
take the senders to travel the distance. But this
one comes from London, and therefore we cannot
count upon delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What can it mean, this
relentless persecution?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers which Openshaw carried are obvi-
ously of vital importance to the person or persons
in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that
there must be more than one of them. A single
man could not have carried out two deaths in such
a way as to deceive a coroner&#8217;s jury. There must
have been several in it, and they must have been
men of resource and determination. Their papers
they mean to have, be the holder of them who it
may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the
initials of an individual and becomes the badge of
a society.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But of what society?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never&#8212;&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes,
bending forward and sinking his voice&#8212;&#8220;have you
never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book
upon his knee. &#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said he presently:
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the
fanciful resemblance to the sound produced
by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret soci-
ety was formed by some ex-Confederate sol-
diers in the Southern states after the Civil
War, and it rapidly formed local branches
in different parts of the country, notably in
Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Geor-
gia, and Florida. Its power was used for po-
litical purposes, principally for the terroris-
ing of the negro voters and the murdering
and driving from the country of those who
were opposed to its views. Its outrages were
usually preceded by a warning sent to the
</p>
<p>marked man in some fantastic but generally
recognised shape&#8212;a sprig of oak-leaves in
some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in
others. On receiving this the victim might
either openly abjure his former ways, or
might fly from the country. If he braved the
matter out, death would unfailingly come
upon him, and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner. So perfect was the or-
ganisation of the society, and so systematic
its methods, that there is hardly a case upon
record where any man succeeded in braving
it with impunity, or in which any of its out-
rages were traced home to the perpetrators.
For some years the organisation flourished
in spite of the efforts of the United States
government and of the better classes of the
community in the South. Eventually, in
the year 1869, the movement rather sud-
denly collapsed, although there have been
sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since
that date.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will observe,&#8221; said Holmes, laying down the
volume, &#8220;that the sudden breaking up of the so-
ciety was coincident with the disappearance of
Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder
that he and his family have some of the more im-
placable spirits upon their track. You can under-
stand that this register and diary may implicate
some of the first men in the South, and that there
may be many who will not sleep easy at night until
it is recovered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the page we have seen&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remem-
ber right, &#8216;sent the pips to A, B, and C&#8217;&#8212;that is,
sent the society&#8217;s warning to them. Then there are
successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the
country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear,
a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we
may let some light into this dark place, and I be-
lieve that the only chance young Openshaw has in
the meantime is to do what I have told him. There
is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night,
so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
for half an hour the miserable weather and the still
more miserable ways of our fellow-men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was
shining with a subdued brightness through the
dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sher-
lock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
down.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Five Orange Pips
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me for not waiting for you,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;I have, I foresee, a very busy day be-
fore me in looking into this case of young Open-
shaw&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What steps will you take?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;It will very much depend upon the results of
</p>
<p>my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Hor-
sham, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not go there first?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring
</p>
<p>the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.&#8221;
As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper
</p>
<p>from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested
upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;you are too late.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, laying down his cup, &#8220;I feared
</p>
<p>as much. How was it done?&#8221; He spoke calmly, but
I could see that he was deeply moved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and
the heading &#8216;Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.&#8217; Here
is the account:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Between nine and ten last night Police-
Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty
near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help
and a splash in the water. The night, how-
ever, was extremely dark and stormy, so
that, in spite of the help of several passers-
by, it was quite impossible to effect a res-
cue. The alarm, however, was given, and,
by the aid of the water-police, the body was
eventually recovered. It proved to be that of
a young gentleman whose name, as it ap-
pears from an envelope which was found in
his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose
residence is near Horsham. It is conjec-
tured that he may have been hurrying down
to catch the last train from Waterloo Sta-
tion, and that in his haste and the extreme
darkness he missed his path and walked
over the edge of one of the small landing-
places for river steamboats. The body ex-
hibited no traces of violence, and there can
be no doubt that the deceased had been the
victim of an unfortunate accident, which
should have the effect of calling the atten-
tion of the authorities to the condition of
the riverside landing-stages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more
depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That hurts my pride, Watson,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my
pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now,
and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand
</p>
<p>upon this gang. That he should come to me for
help, and that I should send him away to his
death&#8212;!&#8221; He sprang from his chair and paced
about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
flush upon his sallow cheeks and a ne
