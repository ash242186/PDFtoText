</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.
Death on the Moor
</p>
<p>For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly
able to believe my ears. Then my senses and my
voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted
from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice
could belong to but one man in all the world.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221; I cried&#8212;&#8220;Holmes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and please be careful
with the revolver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat
upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with
amusement as they fell upon my astonished fea-
tures. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert,
his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened
by the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he
looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and
he had contrived, with that cat-like love of per-
sonal cleanliness which was one of his character-
istics, that his chin should be as smooth and his
linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was more glad to see anyone in my
life,&#8221; said I, as I wrung him by the hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or more astonished, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The surprise was not all on one side, I assure
you. I had no idea that you had found my occa-
sional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until
I was within twenty paces of the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My footprint, I presume?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Watson; I fear that I could not under-
take to recognize your footprint amid all the foot-
prints of the world. If you seriously desire to de-
ceive me you must change your tobacconist; for
when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley,
Oxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is
in the neighbourhood. You will see it there be-
side the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at
that supreme moment when you charged into the
empty hut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought as much&#8212;and knowing your ad-
mirable tenacity I was convinced that you were
sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting
for the tenant to return. So you actually thought
that I was the criminal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know who you were, but I was de-
termined to find out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize
me? You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the con-
vict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the
moon to rise behind me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw you then.&#8221;
&#8220;And have no doubt searched all the huts until
</p>
<p>you came to this one?&#8221;
&#8220;No, your boy had been observed, and that
</p>
<p>gave me a guide where to look.&#8221;
&#8220;The old gentleman with the telescope, no
</p>
<p>doubt. I could not make it out when first I saw
the light flashing upon the lens.&#8221; He rose and
peeped into the hut. &#8220;Ha, I see that Cartwright
has brought up some supplies. What&#8217;s this paper?
So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;Well done! Our researches have evidently
</p>
<p>been running on parallel lines, and when we unite
our results I expect we shall have a fairly full
knowledge of the case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am glad from my heart that you are
here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery
were both becoming too much for my nerves. But
how in the name of wonder did you come here,
and what have you been doing? I thought that
you were in Baker Street working out that case of
blackmailing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what I wished you to think.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I cried with some bitterness. &#8220;I think that I have
deserved better at your hands, Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to
me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that
you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick
upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own
sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of
the danger which you ran which led me to come
down and examine the matter for myself. Had I
been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that
my point of view would have been the same as
yours, and my presence would have warned our
very formidable opponents to be on their guard.
As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not
possibly have done had I been living in the Hall,
and I remain an unknown factor in the business,
ready to throw in all my weight at a critical mo-
ment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why keep me in the dark?&#8221;
</p>
<p>641</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;For you to know could not have helped us,
and might possibly have led to my discovery. You
would have wished to tell me something, or in
your kindness you would have brought me out
some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk
would be run. I brought Cartwright down with
me&#8212;you remember the little chap at the express
office&#8212;and he has seen after my simple wants: a
loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man
want more? He has given me an extra pair of eyes
upon a very active pair of feet, and both have been
invaluable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then my reports have all been wasted!&#8221;&#8212;My
voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride
with which I had composed them.
</p>
<p>Holmes took a bundle of papers from his
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and
very well thumbed, I assure you. I made excellent
arrangements, and they are only delayed one day
upon their way. I must compliment you exceed-
ingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you
have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was still rather raw over the deception which
had been practised upon me, but the warmth of
Holmes&#8217;s praise drove my anger from my mind.
I felt also in my heart that he was right in what
he said and that it was really best for our purpose
that I should not have known that he was upon the
moor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said he, seeing the shadow rise
from my face. &#8220;And now tell me the result of your
visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons&#8212;it was not difficult for
me to guess that it was to see her that you had
gone, for I am already aware that she is the one
person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service
to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone to-
day it is exceedingly probable that I should have
gone to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sun had set and dusk was settling over the
moor. The air had turned chill and we withdrew
into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together
in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation
with the lady. So interested was he that I had to
repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is most important,&#8221; said he when I had
concluded. &#8220;It fills up a gap which I had been un-
able to bridge, in this most complex affair. You
are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists be-
tween this lady and the man Stapleton?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know of a close intimacy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no doubt about the matter. They
meet, they write, there is a complete understand-
ing between them. Now, this puts a very powerful
weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to
detach his wife&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am giving you some information now, in re-
turn for all that you have given me. The lady who
has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his
wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what
you say? How could he have permitted Sir Henry
to fall in love with her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Henry&#8217;s falling in love could do no harm to
anyone except Sir Henry. He took particular care
that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have
yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife
and not his sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why this elaborate deception?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he foresaw that she would be very
much more useful to him in the character of a free
woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspi-
cions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the
naturalist. In that impassive, colourless man, with
his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see
something terrible&#8212;a creature of infinite patience
and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous
heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is he, then, who is our enemy&#8212;it is he who
dogged us in London?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I read the riddle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the warning&#8212;it must have come from
her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The shape of some monstrous villainy, half
seen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness
which had girt me so long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you
know that the woman is his wife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you
a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion
when he first met you, and I dare say he has many
a time regretted it since. He was once a school-
master in the north of England. Now, there is no
one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There
are scholastic agencies by which one may identify
any man who has been in the profession. A little
investigation showed me that a school had come
to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that
</p>
<p>642</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Death on the Moor
</p>
<p>the man who had owned it&#8212;the name was differ-
ent&#8212;had disappeared with his wife. The descrip-
tions agreed. When I learned that the missing man
was devoted to entomology the identification was
complete.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The darkness was rising, but much was still
hidden by the shadows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this woman is in truth his wife, where does
Mrs. Laura Lyons come in?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the points upon which your
own researches have shed a light. Your interview
with the lady has cleared the situation very much.
I did not know about a projected divorce between
herself and her husband. In that case, regarding
Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no
doubt upon becoming his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when she is undeceived?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, then we may find the lady of service. It
must be our first duty to see her&#8212;both of us&#8212;to-
morrow. Don&#8217;t you think, Watson, that you are
away from your charge rather long? Your place
should be at Baskerville Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last red streaks had faded away in the west
and night had settled upon the moor. A few faint
stars were gleaming in a violet sky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One last question, Holmes,&#8221; I said, as I rose.
&#8220;Surely there is no need of secrecy between you
and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he
after?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217;s voice sank as he answered:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is murder, Watson&#8212;refined, cold-blooded,
deliberate murder. Do not ask me for particulars.
My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon
Sir Henry, and with your help he is already al-
most at my mercy. There is but one danger which
can threaten us. It is that he should strike before
we are ready to do so. Another day&#8212;two at the
most&#8212;and I have my case complete, but until then
guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother
watched her ailing child. Your mission to-day has
justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you
had not left his side. Hark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A terrible scream&#8212;a prolonged yell of horror
and anguish&#8212;burst out of the silence of the moor.
That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my
veins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God!&#8221; I gasped. &#8220;What is it? What
does it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his
dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his
shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his
face peering into the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Hush!&#8221;
The cry had been loud on account of its vehe-
</p>
<p>mence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far
off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our
ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; Holmes whispered; and I knew
from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron,
was shaken to the soul. &#8220;Where is it, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, I think.&#8221; I pointed into the darkness.
&#8220;No, there!&#8221;
Again the agonized cry swept through the
</p>
<p>silent night, louder and much nearer than ever.
And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, mut-
tered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising
and falling like the low, constant murmur of the
sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hound!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;Come, Watson,
come! Great heavens, if we are too late!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had started running swiftly over the moor,
and I had followed at his heels. But now from
somewhere among the broken ground immedi-
ately in front of us there came one last despair-
ing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted
and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy
silence of the windless night.
</p>
<p>I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like
a man distracted. He stamped his feet upon the
ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, surely not!&#8221;
&#8220;Fool that I was to hold my hand. And
</p>
<p>you, Watson, see what comes of abandoning your
charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened,
we&#8217;ll avenge him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blindly we ran through the gloom, blunder-
ing against boulders, forcing our way through
gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down
slopes, heading always in the direction whence
those dreadful sounds had come. At every rise
Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shad-
ows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved
upon its dreary face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see anything?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
&#8220;But, hark, what is that?&#8221;
A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There
</p>
<p>it was again upon our left! On that side a ridge
of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a
stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-
eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran to-
wards it the vague outline hardened into a defi-
nite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward
upon the ground, the head doubled under him at
</p>
<p>643</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the
body hunched together as if in the act of throw-
ing a somersault. So grotesque was the attitude
that I could not for the instant realize that that
moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a
whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark fig-
ure over which we stooped. Holmes laid his hand
upon him, and held it up again, with an excla-
mation of horror. The gleam of the match which
he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon
the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the
crushed skull of the victim. And it shone upon
something else which turned our hearts sick and
faint within us&#8212;the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!
</p>
<p>There was no chance of either of us forget-
ting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit&#8212;the very one
which he had worn on the first morning that we
had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one
clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered
and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our
souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered
white through the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The brute! the brute!&#8221; I cried with clenched
hands. &#8220;Oh Holmes, I shall never forgive myself
for having left him to his fate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am more to blame than you, Watson. In or-
der to have my case well rounded and complete,
I have thrown away the life of my client. It is the
greatest blow which has befallen me in my career.
But how could I know&#8212;how could l know&#8212;that
he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the
face of all my warnings?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That we should have heard his screams&#8212;my
God, those screams!&#8212;and yet have been unable to
save him! Where is this brute of a hound which
drove him to his death? It may be lurking among
these rocks at this instant. And Stapleton, where
is he? He shall answer for this deed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew
have been murdered&#8212;the one frightened to death
by the very sight of a beast which he thought to
be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his
wild flight to escape from it. But now we have
to prove the connection between the man and the
beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even
swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry
has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,
cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power
before another day is past!&#8221;
</p>
<p>We stood with bitter hearts on either side of
the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden
and irrevocable disaster which had brought all
our long and weary labours to so piteous an end.
Then, as the moon rose we climbed to the top of
</p>
<p>the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen,
and from the summit we gazed out over the shad-
owy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away,
miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single
steady yellow light was shining. It could only
come from the lonely abode of the Stapletons.
With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we not seize him at once?&#8221;
&#8220;Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary
</p>
<p>and cunning to the last degree. It is not what we
know, but what we can prove. If we make one false
move the villain may escape us yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221;
&#8220;There will be plenty for us to do to-morrow.
</p>
<p>To-night we can only perform the last offices to
our poor friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Together we made our way down the precip-
itous slope and approached the body, black and
clear against the silvered stones. The agony of
those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of
pain and blurred my eyes with tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot
carry him all the way to the Hall. Good heavens,
are you mad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had uttered a cry and bent over the body.
Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing
my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!
</p>
<p>&#8220;A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!&#8221;
&#8220;A beard?&#8221;
&#8220;It is not the baronet&#8212;it is&#8212;why, it is my
</p>
<p>neighbour, the convict!&#8221;
With feverish haste we had turned the body
</p>
<p>over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to
the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt
about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal
eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared
upon me in the light of the candle from over the
rock&#8212;the face of Selden, the criminal.
</p>
<p>Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I re-
membered how the baronet had told me that he
had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Bar-
rymore had passed it on in order to help Selden
in his escape. Boots, shirt, cap&#8212;it was all Sir
Henry&#8217;s. The tragedy was still black enough, but
this man had at least deserved death by the laws of
his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,
my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the clothes have been the poor devil&#8217;s
death,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is clear enough that the
hound has been laid on from some article of Sir
Henry&#8217;s&#8212;the boot which was abstracted in the ho-
tel, in all probability&#8212;and so ran this man down.
</p>
<p>644</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Death on the Moor
</p>
<p>There is one very singular thing, however: How
came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the
hound was on his trail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He heard him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To hear a hound upon the moor would not
work a hard man like this convict into such a
paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture
by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must
have run a long way after he knew the animal was
on his track. How did he know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A greater mystery to me is why this hound,
presuming that all our conjectures are correct&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why this hound should be loose to-
night. I suppose that it does not always run loose
upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go un-
less he had reason to think that Sir Henry would
be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My difficulty is the more formidable of the
two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an
explanation of yours, while mine may remain for-
ever a mystery. The question now is, what shall
we do with this poor wretch&#8217;s body? We cannot
leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until
we can communicate with the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could
carry it so far. Halloa, Watson, what&#8217;s this? It&#8217;s
the man himself, by all that&#8217;s wonderful and auda-
cious! Not a word to show your suspicions&#8212;not a
word, or my plans crumble to the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A figure was approaching us over the moor,
and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar. The moon
shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dap-
per shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He
stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dr. Watson, that&#8217;s not you, is it? You are
the last man that I should have expected to see out
on the moor at this time of night. But, dear me,
what&#8217;s this? Somebody hurt? Not&#8212;don&#8217;t tell me
that it is our friend Sir Henry!&#8221; He hurried past me
and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp
intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fin-
gers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8212;who&#8217;s this?&#8221; he stammered.
