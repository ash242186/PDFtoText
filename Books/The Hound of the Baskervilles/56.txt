</p>
<p>so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to
your rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A square balustraded gallery ran round the top
of the old hall, approached by a double stair. From
this central point two long corridors extended the
whole length of the building, from which all the
bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing
as Baskerville&#8217;s and almost next door to it. These
rooms appeared to be much more modern than
the central part of the house, and the bright paper
and numerous candles did something to remove
the sombre impression which our arrival had left
upon my mind.
</p>
<p>But the dining-room which opened out of the
hall was a place of shadow and gloom. It was
a long chamber with a step separating the dais
where the family sat from the lower portion re-
served for their dependents. At one end a min-
strel&#8217;s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot
across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened
ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches
to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of
an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but
now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the
little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one&#8217;s
voice became hushed and one&#8217;s spirit subdued. A
dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress,
from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Re-
gency, stared down upon us and daunted us by
their silent company. We talked little, and I for one
was glad when the meal was over and we were
able to retire into the modern billiard-room and
smoke a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My word, it isn&#8217;t a very cheerful place,&#8221; said
Sir Henry. &#8220;I suppose one can tone down to it, but
I feel a bit out of the picture at present. I don&#8217;t
wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived
all alone in such a house as this. However, if it
suits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps
things may seem more cheerful in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed
and looked out from my window. It opened upon
the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door.
Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung
in a rising wind. A half moon broke through the
rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I saw be-
yond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the
long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I closed
the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in
keeping with the rest.
</p>
<p>And yet it was not quite the last. I found my-
self weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from
side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not
come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the
quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly si-
lence lay upon the old house. And then suddenly,
in the very dead of the night, there came a sound
to my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It
was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling
gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sor-
row. I sat up in bed and listened intently. The
noise could not have been far away and was cer-
tainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with
every nerve on the alert, but there came no other
sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the
ivy on the wall.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Stapletons of Merripit House
</p>
<p>The fresh beauty of the following morning did
something to efface from our minds the grim and
gray impression which had been left upon both
of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall.
As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight
flooded in through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches of colour from the coats
of arms which covered them. The dark panelling
glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was
hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber
</p>
<p>which had struck such a gloom into our souls
upon the evening before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it is ourselves and not the house that
we have to blame!&#8221; said the baronet. &#8220;We were
tired with our journey and chilled by our drive,
so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are
fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet it was not entirely a question of imag-
ination,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Did you, for example, hap-
pen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in
</p>
<p>614</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stapletons of Merripit House
</p>
<p>the night?&#8221;
&#8220;That is curious, for I did when I was half
</p>
<p>asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort. I
waited quite a time, but there was no more of it,
so I concluded that it was all a dream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was
really the sob of a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must ask about this right away.&#8221; He rang
the bell and asked Barrymore whether he could ac-
count for our experience. It seemed to me that the
pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler
still as he listened to his master&#8217;s question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only two women in the house, Sir
Henry,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;One is the scullery-maid,
who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my
wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could
not have come from her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that
after breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long
corridor with the sun full upon her face. She was
a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a
stern set expression of mouth. But her tell-tale
eyes were red and glanced at me from between
swollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the
night, and if she did so her husband must know
it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discov-
ery in declaring that it was not so. Why had he
done this? And why did she weep so bitterly?
Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-
bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere
of mystery and of gloom. It was he who had been
the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we
had only his word for all the circumstances which
led up to the old man&#8217;s death. Was it possible that
it was Barrymore after all whom we had seen in
the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well
have been the same. The cabman had described
a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression
might easily have been erroneous. How could I
settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing
to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster, and find
whether the test telegram had really been placed
in Barrymore&#8217;s own hands. Be the answer what it
might, I should at least have something to report
to Sherlock Holmes.
</p>
<p>Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine af-
ter breakfast, so that the time was propitious for
my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four miles
along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a
small gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings,
which proved to be the inn and the house of Dr.
Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmas-
ter, who was also the village grocer, had a clear
recollection of the telegram.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I had the telegram de-
livered to Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who delivered it?&#8221;
&#8220;My boy here. James, you delivered that tele-
</p>
<p>gram to Mr. Barrymore at the Hall last week, did
you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father, I delivered it.&#8221;
&#8220;Into his own hands?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that
</p>
<p>I could not put it into his own hands, but I gave it
into Mrs. Barrymore&#8217;s hands, and she promised to
deliver it at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Mr. Barrymore?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.&#8221;
&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t see him, how do you know he
</p>
<p>was in the loft?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, surely his own wife ought to know
</p>
<p>where he is,&#8221; said the postmaster testily. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
he get the telegram? If there is any mistake it is for
Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any
farther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes&#8217;s
ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not
been in London all the time. Suppose that it were
so&#8212;suppose that the same man had been the last
who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog
the new heir when he returned to England. What
then? Was he the agent of others or had he some
sinister design of his own? What interest could
he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I
thought of the strange warning clipped out of the
leading article of the Times. Was that his work
or was it possibly the doing of someone who was
bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only
conceivable motive was that which had been sug-
gested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be
scared away a comfortable and permanent home
would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely
such an explanation as that would be quite inad-
equate to account for the deep and subtle schem-
ing which seemed to be weaving an invisible net
round the young baronet. Holmes himself had
said that no more complex case had come to him in
all the long series of his sensational investigations.
I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely
road, that my friend might soon be freed from his
preoccupations and able to come down to take this
heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.
</p>
<p>Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the
sound of running feet behind me and by a voice
which called me by name. I turned, expecting
to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a
stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small,
</p>
<p>615</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of
age, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw
hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over
his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net
in one of his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption,
Dr. Watson,&#8221; said he, as he came panting up to
where I stood. &#8220;Here on the moor we are homely
folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You
may possibly have heard my name from our mu-
tual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit
House.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your net and box would have told me as
much,&#8221; said I, &#8220;for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was
a naturalist. But how did you know me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been calling on Mortimer, and he
pointed you out to me from the window of his
surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same
way I thought that I would overtake you and in-
troduce myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the
worse for his journey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very well, thank you.&#8221;
&#8220;We were all rather afraid that after the sad
</p>
<p>death of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse
to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy man
to come down and bury himself in a place of this
kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very
great deal to the country-side. Sir Henry has, I
suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think that it is likely.&#8221;
&#8220;Of course you know the legend of the fiend
</p>
<p>dog which haunts the family?&#8221;
&#8220;I have heard it.&#8221;
&#8220;It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants
</p>
<p>are about here! Any number of them are ready to
swear that they have seen such a creature upon the
moor.&#8221; He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read
in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously.
&#8220;The story took a great hold upon the imagination
of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to
his tragic end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;
&#8220;His nerves were so worked up that the ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect
upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really did
see something of the kind upon that last night in
the Yew Alley. I feared that some disaster might
occur, for I was very fond of the old man, and I
knew that his heart was weak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;
&#8220;My friend Mortimer told me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir
Charles, and that he died of fright in conse-
quence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any better explanation?&#8221;
&#8220;I have not come to any conclusion.&#8221;
&#8220;Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&#8221;
The words took away my breath for an instant,
</p>
<p>but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes
of my companion showed that no surprise was in-
tended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is useless for us to pretend that we do not
know you, Dr. Watson,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The records
of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known
yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he
could not deny your identity. If you are here, then
it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting
himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious
to know what view he may take.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that I cannot answer that ques-
tion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask if he is going to honour us with a
visit himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He cannot leave town at present. He has other
cases which engage his attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity! He might throw some light on
that which is so dark to us. But as to your own
researches, if there is any possible way in which I
can be of service to you I trust that you will com-
mand me. If I had any indication of the nature of
your suspicions or how you propose to investigate
the case, I might perhaps even now give you some
aid or advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit
to my friend, Sir Henry, and that I need no help of
any kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Stapleton. &#8220;You are perfectly
right to be wary and discreet. I am justly reproved
for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and
I promise you that I will not mention the matter
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had come to a point where a narrow grassy
path struck off from the road and wound away
across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill
lay upon the right which had in bygone days been
cut into a granite quarry. The face which was
turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns
and brambles growing in its niches. From over a
distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A moderate walk along this moor-path brings
us to Merripit House,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps you will
spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of in-
troducing you to my sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>616</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stapletons of Merripit House
</p>
<p>My first thought was that I should be by Sir
Henry&#8217;s side. But then I remembered the pile
of papers and bills with which his study table
was littered. It was certain that I could not help
with those. And Holmes had expressly said that
I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
accepted Stapleton&#8217;s invitation, and we turned to-
gether down the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful place, the moor,&#8221; said he,
looking round over the undulating downs, long
green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foam-
ing up into fantastic surges. &#8220;You never tire of
the moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets
which it contains. It is so vast, and so barren, and
so mysterious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it well, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only been here two years. The residents
would call me a newcomer. We came shortly after
Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led me to explore
every part of the country round, and I should think
that there are few men who know it better than I
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it hard to know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very hard. You see, for example, this great
plain to the north here with the queer hills break-
ing out of it. Do you observe anything remarkable
about that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a rare place for a gallop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would naturally think so and the thought
has cost several their lives before now. You notice
those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stapleton laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the great Grimpen Mire,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A
false step yonder means death to man or beast.
Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wan-
der into it. He never came out. I saw his head for
quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but
it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it
is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains
it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to
the very heart of it and return alive. By George,
there is another of those miserable ponies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Something brown was rolling and tossing
among the green sedges. Then a long, agonized,
writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry
echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with
horror, but my companion&#8217;s nerves seemed to be
stronger than mine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; said he. &#8220;The mire has him. Two
in two days, and many more, perhaps, for they get
in the way of going there in the dry weather, and
</p>
<p>never know the difference until the mire has them
in its clutches. It&#8217;s a bad place, the great Grimpen
Mire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you say you can penetrate it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, there are one or two paths which a very
</p>
<p>active man can take. I have found them out.&#8221;
&#8220;But why should you wish to go into so horri-
</p>
<p>ble a place?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you see the hills beyond? They are re-
</p>
<p>ally islands cut off on all sides by the impassable
mire, which has crawled round them in the course
of years. That is where the rare plants and the but-
terflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall try my luck some day.&#8221;
He looked at me with a surprised face.
&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake put such an idea out of your
</p>
<p>mind,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Your blood would be upon my
head. I assure you that there would not be the
least chance of your coming back alive. It is only
by remembering certain complex landmarks that I
am able to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What is that?&#8221;
A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept
</p>
<p>over the moor. It filled the whole air, and yet it
was impossible to say whence it came. From a
dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then
sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur
once again. Stapleton looked at me with a curious
expression in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer place, the moor!&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But what is it?&#8221;
&#8220;The peasants say it is the Hound of the
</p>
<p>Baskervilles calling for its prey. I&#8217;ve heard it once
or twice before, but never quite so loud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart,
at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green
patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over the vast ex-
panse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly
from a tor behind us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an educated man. You don&#8217;t believe
such nonsense as that?&#8221; said I. &#8220;What do you think
is the cause of so strange a sound?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It&#8217;s the
mud settling, or the water rising, or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, that was a living voice.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bit-
</p>
<p>tern booming?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I never did.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a very rare bird&#8212;practically extinct&#8212;in
</p>
<p>England now, but all things are possible upon the
moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to learn that
</p>
<p>617</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>what we have heard is the cry of the last of the
bitterns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I
heard in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s rather an uncanny place altogether.
Look at the hill-side yonder. What do you make of
those?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The whole steep slope was covered with gray
circular rings of stone, a score of them at least.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they? Sheep-pens?&#8221;
&#8220;No, they are the homes of our worthy ances-
</p>
<p>tors. Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor,
and as no one in particular has lived there since,
we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left
them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off.
You can even see his hearth and his couch if you
have the curiosity to go inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?&#8221;
&#8220;Neolithic man&#8212;no date.&#8221;
&#8220;What did he do?&#8221;
&#8220;He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he
</p>
<p>learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword be-
gan to supersede the stone axe. Look at the great
trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,
you will find some very singular points about the
moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is
surely Cyclopides.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A small fly or moth had fluttered across our
path, and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with
extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it.
To my dismay the creature flew straight for the
great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for
an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it,
his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes
and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not
unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing
watching his pursuit with a mixture of admira-
tion for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he
should lose his footing in the treacherous mire,
when I heard the sound of steps, and turning
round found a woman near me upon the path. She
had come from the direction in which the plume
of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House,
but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was
quite close.
</p>
<p>I could not doubt that this was the Miss Sta-
pleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of
any sort must be few upon the moor, and I re-
membered that I had heard someone describe her
as being a beauty. The woman who approached
me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon
type. There could not have been a greater con-
trast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was
</p>
<p>neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while
she was darker than any brunette whom I have
seen in England&#8212;slim, elegant, and tall. She had
a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might
have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive
mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With
her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, in-
deed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland
path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned,
and then she quickened her pace towards me. I
had raised my hat and was about to make some
explanatory remark, when her own words turned
all my thoughts into a new channel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Go straight back to Lon-
don, instantly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her
eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground im-
patiently with her foot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I go back?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot explain.&#8221; She spoke in a low, eager
voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance. &#8220;But
for God&#8217;s sake do what I ask you. Go back and
never set foot upon the moor again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have only just come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, man!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Can you not tell when
a warning is for your own good? Go back to Lon-
don! Start to-night! Get away from this place at all
costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word
of what I have said. Would you mind getting that
orchid for me among the mares-tails yonder? We
are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of
course, you are rather late to see the beauties of
the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came
back to us breathing hard and flushed with his ex-
ertions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa, Beryl!&#8221; said he, and it seemed to me
that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a
cordial one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack, you are very hot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very
rare and seldom found in the late autumn. What
a pity that I should have missed him!&#8221; He spoke
unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced in-
cessantly from the girl to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have introduced yourselves, I can see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather
late for him to see the true beauties of the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, who do you think this is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine that it must be Sir Henry
Baskerville.&#8221;

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Stapletons of Merripit House
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Only a humble commoner,
but his friend. My name is Dr. Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flush of vexation passed over her expressive
face. &#8220;We have been talking at cross purposes,&#8221;
said she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you had not very much time for talk,&#8221;
her brother remarked with the same questioning
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident in-
stead of being merely a visitor,&#8221; said she. &#8220;It can-
not much matter to him whether it is early or late
for the orchids. But you will come on, will you
not, and see Merripit House?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moor-
land house, once the farm of some grazier in the
old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard sur-
rounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the
moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of
the whole place was mean and melancholy. We
were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated
old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the
house. Inside, however, there were large rooms
furnished with an elegance in which I seemed
to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked
from their windows at the interminable granite-
flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest hori-
zon I could not but marvel at what could have
brought this highly educated man and this beauti-
ful woman to live in such a place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer spot to choose, is it not?&#8221; said he as if
in answer to my thought. &#8220;And yet we manage to
make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite happy,&#8221; said she, but there was no ring
of conviction in her words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a school,&#8221; said Stapleton. &#8220;It was in the
north country. The work to a man of my temper-
ament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould
those young minds, and of impressing them with
one&#8217;s own character and ideals, was very dear to
me. However, the fates were against us. A serious
epidemic broke out in the school and three of the
boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and
much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed
up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charm-
ing companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over
my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for
botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of
work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as
I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon
your head by your expression as you surveyed the
moor out of our window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly did cross my mind that it might be
a little dull&#8212;less for you, perhaps, than for your
sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I am never dull,&#8221; said she, quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have books, we have our studies, and we
have interesting neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a
most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles
was also an admirable companion. We knew him
well, and miss him more than I can tell. Do you
think that I should intrude if I were to call this af-
ternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that he would be delighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you would mention that I pro-
pose to do so. We may in our humble way do
something to make things more easy for him until
he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings.
Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect
my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most
complete one in the south-west of England. By the
time that you have looked through them lunch will
be almost ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I was eager to get back to my charge. The
melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfor-
tunate pony, the weird sound which had been as-
sociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles,
all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness.
Then on the top of these more or less vague im-
pressions there had come the definite and distinct
warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such in-
tense earnestness that I could not doubt that some
grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all
pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once
upon my return journey, taking the grass-grown
path by which we had come.
</p>
<p>It seems, however, that there must have been
some short cut for those who knew it, for before I
had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss
Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the
track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her
exertions, and she held her hand to her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have run all the way in order to cut you off,
Dr. Watson,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I had not even time to put
on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother may
miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am
about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that
you were Sir Henry. Please forget the words I said,
which have no application whatever to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t forget them, Miss Stapleton,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I am Sir Henry&#8217;s friend, and his welfare is a very
close concern of mine. Tell me why it was that
you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to
London.&#8221;
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s whim, Dr. Watson. When you
know me better you will understand that I cannot
always give reasons for what I say or do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice.
I remember the look in your eyes. Please, please,
be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since
I have been here I have been conscious of shad-
ows all round me. Life has become like that
great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches ev-
erywhere into which one may sink and with no
guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was
that you meant, and I will promise to convey your
warning to Sir Henry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An expression of irresolution passed for an in-
stant over her face, but her eyes had hardened
again when she answered me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;My brother and I were very much shocked
by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very in-
timately, for his favourite walk was over the moor
to our house. He was deeply impressed with
the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must
be som
