<p>express from town. &#8220;I shall soon be in the posi-
tion of being able to put into a single connected
narrative one of the most singular and sensational
crimes of modern times. Students of criminology
will remember the analogous incidents in Godno,
in Little Russia, in the year &#8217;66, and of course there
are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but
this case possesses some features which are en-
tirely its own. Even now we have no clear case
against this very wily man. But I shall be very
much surprised if it is not clear enough before we
go to bed this night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The London express came roaring into the sta-
tion, and a small, wiry bulldog of a man had
sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three
</p>
<p>shook hands, and I saw at once from the rever-
ential way in which Lestrade gazed at my com-
panion that he had learned a good deal since the
days when they had first worked together. I could
well remember the scorn which the theories of the
reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything good?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest thing for years,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;We have two hours before we need think of start-
ing. I think we might employ it in getting some
dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the Lon-
don fog out of your throat by giving you a breath
of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never been
there? Ah, well, I don&#8217;t suppose you will forget
your first visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.
The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>One of Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s defects&#8212;if, indeed,
one may call it a defect&#8212;was that he was exceed-
ingly loath to communicate his full plans to any
other person until the instant of their fulfilment.
Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful na-
ture, which loved to dominate and surprise those
who were around him. Partly also from his profes-
sional caution, which urged him never to take any
chances. The result, however, was very trying for
those who were acting as his agents and assistants.
I had often suffered under it, but never more so
than during that long drive in the darkness. The
great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were
about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had
said nothing, and I could only surmise what his
course of action would be. My nerves thrilled with
anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our
faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of
the narrow road told me that we were back upon
the moor once again. Every stride of the horses
and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer
to our supreme adventure.
</p>
<p>Our conversation was hampered by the pres-
ence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that
we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our
nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.
It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint,
when we at last passed Frankland&#8217;s house and
</p>
<p>knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and
to the scene of action. We did not drive up to the
door but got down near the gate of the avenue.
The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return
to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to
walk to Merripit House.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you armed, Lestrade?&#8221;
The little detective smiled.
&#8220;As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-
</p>
<p>pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have
something in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! My friend and I are also ready for
emergencies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mighty close about this affair, Mr.
Holmes. What&#8217;s the game now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A waiting game.&#8221;
&#8220;My word, it does not seem a very cheerful
</p>
<p>place,&#8221; said the detective with a shiver, glancing
round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at
the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen
Mire. &#8220;I see the lights of a house ahead of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Merripit House and the end of our
journey. I must request you to walk on tiptoe and
not to talk above a whisper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We moved cautiously along the track as if we
were bound for the house, but Holmes halted us
when we were about two hundred yards from it.
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;This will do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;These rocks upon the
right make an admirable screen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are to wait here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get
into this hollow, Lestrade. You have been inside
the house, have you not, Watson? Can you tell
the position of the rooms? What are those latticed
windows at this end?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are the kitchen windows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the one beyond, which shines so
brightly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is certainly the dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blinds are up. You know the lie of the
land best. Creep forward quietly and see what
they are doing&#8212;but for heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t let
them know that they are watched!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind
the low wall which surrounded the stunted or-
chard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point
whence I could look straight through the uncur-
tained window.
</p>
<p>There were only two men in the room, Sir
Henry and Stapleton. They sat with their pro-
files towards me on either side of the round table.
Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and
wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking
with animation, but the baronet looked pale and
distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk
across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily
upon his mind.
</p>
<p>As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the
room, while Sir Henry filled his glass again and
leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar. I
heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of
boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the
path on the other side of the wall under which I
crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause
at the door of an out-house in the corner of the or-
chard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in
there was a curious scuffling noise from within.
He was only a minute or so inside, and then I
heard the key turn once more and he passed me
and re-entered the house. I saw him rejoin his
guest, and I crept quietly back to where my com-
panions were waiting to tell them what I had seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?&#8221;
Holmes asked, when I had finished my report.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can she be, then, since there is no light
in any other room except the kitchen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot think where she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire
there hung a dense, white fog. It was drifting
slowly in our direction, and banked itself up like a
wall on that side of us, low, but thick and well
defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked
like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads
of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface.
Holmes&#8217;s face was turned towards it, and he mut-
tered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s moving towards us, Watson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that serious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very serious, indeed&#8212;the one thing upon
earth which could have disarranged my plans. He
can&#8217;t be very long, now. It is already ten o&#8217;clock.
Our success and even his life may depend upon
his coming out before the fog is over the path.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The night was clear and fine above us. The stars
shone cold and bright, while a half-moon bathed
the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light. Before
us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof
and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the
silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light
from the lower windows stretched across the or-
chard and the moor. One of them was suddenly
shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There
only remained the lamp in the dining-room where
the two men, the murderous host and the uncon-
scious guest, still chatted over their cigars.
</p>
<p>Every minute that white woolly plain which
covered one half of the moor was drifting closer
and closer to the house. Already the first thin
wisps of it were curling across the golden square
of the lighted window. The farther wall of the or-
chard was already invisible, and the trees were
standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we
watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round
both corners of the house and rolled slowly into
one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the
roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy
sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon
the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his
impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he isn&#8217;t out in a quarter of an hour the path
will be covered. In half an hour we won&#8217;t be able
to see our hands in front of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we move farther back upon higher
ground?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it would be as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back
before it until we were half a mile from the house,
and still that dense white sea, with the moon
silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inex-
orably on.
</p>
<p>652</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going too far,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;We dare
not take the chance of his being overtaken before
he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our
ground where we are.&#8221; He dropped on his knees
and clapped his ear to the ground. &#8220;Thank God, I
think that I hear him coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the
moor. Crouching among the stones we stared in-
tently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us. The
steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through
a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were
awaiting. He looked round him in surprise as
he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he
came swiftly along the path, passed close to where
we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us.
As he walked he glanced continually over either
shoulder, like a man who is ill at ease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp
click of a cocking pistol. &#8220;Look out! It&#8217;s coming!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from
somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank. The
cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and
we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror
was about to break from the heart of it. I was
at Holmes&#8217;s elbow, and I glanced for an instant
at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes
shining brightly in the moonlight. But suddenly
they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and
his lips parted in amazement. At the same in-
stant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw him-
self face downward upon the ground. I sprang
to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my
mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had
sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog.
A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound,
but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever
seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes
glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and
hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering
flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disor-
dered brain could anything more savage, more ap-
palling, more hellish be conceived than that dark
form and savage face which broke upon us out of
the wall of fog.
</p>
<p>With long bounds the huge black creature was
leaping down the track, following hard upon the
footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by
the apparition that we allowed him to pass be-
fore we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes
and I both fired together, and the creature gave a
hideous howl, which showed that one at least had
hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded
onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry
looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his
</p>
<p>hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the
frightful thing which was hunting him down.
</p>
<p>But that cry of pain from the hound had blown
all our fears to the winds. If he was vulnerable he
was mortal, and if we could wound him we could
kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes
ran that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he
outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little pro-
fessional. In front of us as we flew up the track
we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and
the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see
the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the
ground, and worry at his throat. But the next in-
stant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his re-
volver into the creature&#8217;s flank. With a last howl of
agony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon
its back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell
limp upon its side. I stooped, panting, and pressed
my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it
was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound
was dead.
</p>
<p>Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen.
We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a
prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was
no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been
in time. Already our friend&#8217;s eyelids shivered and
he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust
his brandy-flask between the baronet&#8217;s teeth, and
two frightened eyes were looking up at us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;What was it? What,
in heaven&#8217;s name, was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dead, whatever it is,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
laid the family ghost once and forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In mere size and strength it was a terrible crea-
ture which was lying stretched before us. It was
not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mas-
tiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the
two&#8212;gaunt, savage, and as large as a small li-
oness. Even now, in the stillness of death, the huge
jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame
and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed
with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing
muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers
smouldered and gleamed in the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phosphorus,&#8221; I said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cunning preparation of it,&#8221; said Holmes,
sniffing at the dead animal. &#8220;There is no smell
which might have interfered with his power of
scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for
having exposed you to this fright. I was prepared
for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.
And the fog gave us little time to receive him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have saved my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>653</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;Having first endangered it. Are you strong
enough to stand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me another mouthful of that brandy and
I shall be ready for anything. So! Now, if you will
help me up. What do you propose to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To leave you here. You are not fit for further
adventures to-night. If you will wait, one or other
of us will go back with you to the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still
ghastly pale and trembling in every limb. We
helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering with
his face buried in his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must leave you now,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;The
rest of our work must be done, and every moment
is of importance. We have our case, and now we
only want our man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thousand to one against our finding him
at the house,&#8221; he continued as we retraced our
steps swiftly down the path. &#8220;Those shots must
have told him that the game was up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were some distance off, and this fog may
have deadened them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He followed the hound to call him off&#8212;of that
you may be certain. No, no, he&#8217;s gone by this time!
But we&#8217;ll search the house and make sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The front door was open, so we rushed in and
hurried from room to room to the amazement of a
doddering old manservant, who met us in the pas-
sage. There was no light save in the dining-room,
but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner
of the house unexplored. No sign could we see
of the man whom we were chasing. On the up-
per floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was
locked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s someone in here,&#8221; cried Lestrade. &#8220;I
can hear a movement. Open this door!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint moaning and rustling came from
within. Holmes struck the door just over the lock
with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in
hand, we all three rushed into the room.
</p>
<p>But there was no sign within it of that desper-
ate and defiant villain whom we expected to see.
Instead we were faced by an object so strange and
so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring
at it in amazement.
</p>
<p>The room had been fashioned into a small mu-
seum, and the walls were lined by a number of
glass-topped cases full of that collection of butter-
flies and moths the formation of which had been
the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man.
In the centre of this room there was an upright
beam, which had been placed at some period as
</p>
<p>a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber
which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was
tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which
had been used to secure it that one could not for
the moment tell whether it was that of a man or
a woman. One towel passed round the throat and
was secured at the back of the pillar. Another cov-
ered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark
eyes&#8212;eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful
questioning&#8212;stared back at us. In a minute we
had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and
Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us.
As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the
clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The brute!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;Here, Lestrade,
your brandy-bottle! Put her in the chair! She has
fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened her eyes again.
&#8220;Is he safe?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Has he escaped?&#8221;
&#8220;He cannot escape us, madam.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir
</p>
<p>Henry? Is he safe?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;And the hound?&#8221;
&#8220;It is dead.&#8221;
She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.
&#8220;Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain!
</p>
<p>See how he has treated me!&#8221; She shot her arms
out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that
they were all mottled with bruises. &#8220;But this is
nothing&#8212;nothing! It is my mind and soul that he
has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all, ill-
usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as
long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his
love, but now I know that in this also I have been
his dupe and his tool.&#8221; She broke into passionate
sobbing as she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bear him no good will, madam,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Tell us then where we shall find him.
If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now
and so atone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is but one place where he can have
fled,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;There is an old tin mine
on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there
that he kept his hound and there also he had made
preparations so that he might have a refuge. That
is where he would fly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fog-bank lay like white wool against the
window. Holmes held the lamp towards it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said he. &#8220;No one could find his way into
the Grimpen Mire to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes
and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment.
</p>
<p>654</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may find his way in, but never out,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;How can he see the guiding wands to-
night? We planted them together, he and I, to mark
the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only
have plucked them out to-day. Then indeed you
would have had him at your mercy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evident to us that all pursuit was in
vain until the fog had lifted. Meanwhile we
left Lestrade in possession of the house while
Holmes and I went back with the baronet to
Baskerville Hall. The story of the Stapletons could
no longer be withheld from him, but he took the
blow bravely when he learned the truth about the
woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the
night&#8217;s adventures had shattered his nerves, and
before morning he lay delirious in a high fever, un-
der the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two of them were
destined to travel together round the world before
Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty
man that he had been before he became master of
that ill-omened estate.
</p>
<p>And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of
this singular narrative, in which I have tried to
make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and
ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after
the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we
were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where
they had found a pathway through the bog. It
helped us to realize the horror of this woman&#8217;s life
when we saw the eagerness and joy with which
she laid us on her husband&#8217;s track. We left her
standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty
soil which tapered out into the widespread bog.
From the end of it a small wand planted here and
there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft
to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits
and foul quagmires which barred the way to the
stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants
sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic
vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged
us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quiv-
ering mire, which shook for yards in soft undula-
tions around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked
at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into
it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us
down into those obscene depths, so grim and pur-
poseful was the clutch in which it held us. Once
only we saw a trace that someone had passed that
perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton
grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark
thing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist
as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had
we not been there to drag him out he could never
have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an
</p>
<p>old black boot in the air. &#8220;Meyers, Toronto,&#8221; was
printed on the leather inside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth a mud bath,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is our
friend Sir Henry&#8217;s missing boot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using
</p>
<p>it to set the hound upon the track. He fled when
he knew the game was up, still clutching it. And
he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We
know at least that he came so far in safety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But more than that we were never destined to
know, though there was much which we might
surmise. There was no chance of finding foot-
steps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly
in upon them, but as we at last reached firmer
ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly
for them. But no sligh
