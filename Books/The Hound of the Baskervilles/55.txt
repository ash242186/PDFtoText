</p>
<p>he cried that I should drive right away to Water-
loo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up
the mare and we were there under the ten min-
utes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good
one, and away he went into the station. Only just
as he was leaving he turned round and he said:
&#8216;It might interest you to know that you have been
driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#8217; That&#8217;s how I come
to know the name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. And you saw no more of him?&#8221;
&#8220;Not after he went into the station.&#8221;
&#8220;And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock
</p>
<p>Holmes?&#8221;
The cabman scratched his head. &#8220;Well, he
</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t altogether such an easy gentleman to de-
scribe. I&#8217;d put him at forty years of age, and he
was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter
than you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he
had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a
pale face. I don&#8217;t know as I could say more than
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colour of his eyes?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say that.&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing more that you can remember?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There&#8217;s
another one waiting for you if you can bring any
more information. Good night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, sir, and thank you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes
turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a
rueful smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where
we began,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The cunning rascal! He knew
our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,
conjectured that I had got the number of the cab
and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent
back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson,
this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of
our steel. I&#8217;ve been checkmated in London. I can
only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I&#8217;m
not easy in my mind about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About sending you. It&#8217;s an ugly business,
Watson, an ugly dangerous business, and the more
I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear fellow, you
may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall
be very glad to have you back safe and sound in
Baker Street once more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
Baskerville Hall
</p>
<p>Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were
ready upon the appointed day, and we started as
arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his last
parting injunctions and advice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not bias your mind by suggesting theo-
ries or suspicions, Watson,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I wish you
simply to report facts in the fullest possible man-
ner to me, and you can leave me to do the theoriz-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of facts?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything which may seem to have a bear-
ing however indirect upon the case, and especially
the relations between young Baskerville and his
neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the
death of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries
</p>
<p>myself in the last few days, but the results have,
I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to
be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond,
who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of
a very amiable disposition, so that this persecu-
tion does not arise from him. I really think that
we may eliminate him entirely from our calcula-
tions. There remain the people who will actually
surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it not be well in the first place to get
rid of this Barrymore couple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means. You could not make a greater
mistake. If they are innocent it would be a cruel in-
justice, and if they are guilty we should be giving
up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no,
we will preserve them upon our list of suspects.
Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember
</p>
<p>610</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Baskerville Hall
</p>
<p>right. There are two moorland farmers. There is
our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be en-
tirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we
know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said to be a young
lady of attractions. There is Mr. Frankland, of
Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and
there are one or two other neighbours. These are
the folk who must be your very special study.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do my best.&#8221;
&#8220;You have arms, I suppose?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I thought it as well to take them.&#8221;
&#8220;Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you
</p>
<p>night and day, and never relax your precautions.&#8221;
Our friends had already secured a first-class
</p>
<p>carriage and were waiting for us upon the plat-
form.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we have no news of any kind,&#8221; said Dr.
Mortimer in answer to my friend&#8217;s questions. &#8220;I
can swear to one thing, and that is that we have not
been shadowed during the last two days. We have
never gone out without keeping a sharp watch,
and no one could have escaped our notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have always kept together, I presume?&#8221;
&#8220;Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up
</p>
<p>one day to pure amusement when I come to town,
so I spent it at the Museum of the College of Sur-
geons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I went to look at the folk in the park,&#8221;
said Baskerville. &#8220;But we had no trouble of any
kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was imprudent, all the same,&#8221; said Holmes,
shaking his head and looking very grave. &#8220;I beg,
Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone. Some
great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you
get your other boot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, it is gone forever.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-
</p>
<p>bye,&#8221; he added as the train began to glide down
the platform. &#8220;Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the
phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mor-
timer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those
hours of darkness when the powers of evil are ex-
alted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I looked back at the platform when we had left
it far behind, and saw the tall, austere figure of
Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.
</p>
<p>The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I
spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance
of my two companions and in playing with Dr.
Mortimer&#8217;s spaniel. In a very few hours the brown
earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to
</p>
<p>granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields
where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegeta-
tion spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young
Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window, and
cried aloud with delight as he recognized the fa-
miliar features of the Devon scenery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been over a good part of the world since I
left it, Dr. Watson,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but I have never seen
a place to compare with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a Devonshire man who did not
swear by his county,&#8221; I remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends upon the breed of men quite as
much as on the county,&#8221; said Dr. Mortimer. &#8220;A
glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head
of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthu-
siasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles&#8217;s
head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half
Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very
young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were
you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a boy in my &#8217;teens at the time of my fa-
ther&#8217;s death, and had never seen the Hall, for he
lived in a little cottage on the South Coast. Thence
I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it
is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I&#8217;m
as keen as possible to see the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you? Then your wish is easily granted,
for there is your first sight of the moor,&#8221; said Dr.
Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window.
</p>
<p>Over the green squares of the fields and the low
curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray,
melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit,
dim and vague in the distance, like some fantas-
tic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long
time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his ea-
ger face how much it meant to him, this first sight
of that strange spot where the men of his blood
had held sway so long and left their mark so deep.
There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American
accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage,
and yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face
I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was
of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and master-
ful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in
his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large
hazel eyes. If on that forbidding moor a difficult
and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was
at least a comrade for whom one might venture to
take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely
share it.
</p>
<p>The train pulled up at a small wayside station
and we all descended. Outside, beyond the low,
white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was
</p>
<p>611</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event,
for station-master and porters clustered round us
to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple
country spot, but I was surprised to observe that
by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark
uniforms, who leaned upon their short rifles and
glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coach-
man, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir
Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were
flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling
pasture lands curved upward on either side of us,
and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the
thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and
sunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against
the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the
moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.
</p>
<p>The wagonette swung round into a side road,
and we curved upward through deep lanes worn
by centuries of wheels, high banks on either
side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart&#8217;s-
tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bram-
ble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still
steadily rising, we passed over a narrow gran-
ite bridge, and skirted a noisy stream which
gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid
the gray boulders. Both road and stream wound
up through a valley dense with scrub oak and
fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation
of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking
countless questions. To his eyes all seemed beauti-
ful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the
country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the
waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and
fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rat-
tle of our wheels died away as we drove through
drifts of rotting vegetation&#8212;sad gifts, as it seemed
to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of
the returning heir of the Baskervilles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa!&#8221; cried Dr. Mortimer, &#8220;what is this?&#8221;
A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying
</p>
<p>spur of the moor, lay in front of us. On the summit,
hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its
pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern,
his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was
watching the road along which we travelled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, Perkins?&#8221; asked Dr. Mortimer.
Our driver half turned in his seat.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a convict escaped from Princetown,
</p>
<p>sir. He&#8217;s been out three days now, and the warders
watch every road and every station, but they&#8217;ve
had no sight of him yet. The farmers about here
don&#8217;t like it, sir, and that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I understand that they get five pounds if
they can give information.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a
poor thing compared to the chance of having your
throat cut. You see, it isn&#8217;t like any ordinary con-
vict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, then?&#8221;
&#8220;It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.&#8221;
I remembered the case well, for it was one in
</p>
<p>which Holmes had taken an interest on account
of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wan-
ton brutality which had marked all the actions of
the assassin. The commutation of his death sen-
tence had been due to some doubts as to his com-
plete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our
wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us
rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with
gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind
swept down from it and set us shivering. Some-
where there, on that desolate plain, was lurk-
ing this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a
wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the
whole race which had cast him out. It needed
but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of
the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the dark-
ling sky. Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his
overcoat more closely around him.
</p>
<p>We had left the fertile country behind and be-
neath us. We looked back on it now, the slanting
rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads
of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned
by the plough and the broad tangle of the wood-
lands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and
wilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled
with giant boulders. Now and then we passed a
moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,
with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Sud-
denly we looked down into a cup-like depression,
patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been
twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two
high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver
pointed with his whip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Baskerville Hall,&#8221; said he.
Its master had risen and was staring with
</p>
<p>flushed cheeks and shining eyes. A few min-
utes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a
maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with
weather-bitten pillars on either side, blotched with
lichens, and surmounted by the boars&#8217; heads of the
Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black gran-
ite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a
new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir
Charles&#8217;s South African gold.
</p>
<p>Through the gateway we passed into the av-
enue, where the wheels were again hushed amid
the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches
</p>
<p>612</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Baskerville Hall
</p>
<p>in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville
shuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive
to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the
farther end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it here?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, the Yew Alley is on the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young heir glanced round with a gloomy
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were
coming on him in such a place as this,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;It&#8217;s enough to scare any man. I&#8217;ll have a row of
electric lamps up here inside of six months, and
you won&#8217;t know it again, with a thousand candle-
power Swan and Edison right here in front of the
hall door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The avenue opened into a broad expanse of
turf, and the house lay before us. In the fad-
ing light I could see that the centre was a heavy
block of building from which a porch projected.
The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch
clipped bare here and there where a window or a
coat-of-arms broke through the dark veil. From
this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,
crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To
right and left of the turrets were more modern
wings of black granite. A dull light shone through
heavy mullioned windows, and from the high
chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled
roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville
Hall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the
porch to open the door of the wagonette. The fig-
ure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light of the hall. She came out and helped the man
to hand down our bags.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind my driving straight home, Sir
Henry?&#8221; said Dr. Mortimer. &#8220;My wife is expecting
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you will stay and have some dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I must go. I shall probably find some
work awaiting me. I would stay to show you over
the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide
than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day
to send for me if I can be of service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wheels died away down the drive while
Sir Henry and I turned into the hall, and the door
clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine apart-
ment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and
heavily raftered with huge balks of age-blackened
oak. In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind
the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped.
</p>
<p>Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we
were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed
round us at the high, thin window of old stained
glass, the oak panelling, the stags&#8217; heads, the coats-
of-arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the
subdued light of the central lamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as I imagined it,&#8221; said Sir Henry. &#8220;Is
it not the very picture of an old family home? To
think that this should be the same hall in which for
five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes
me solemn to think of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthu-
siasm as he gazed about him. The light beat upon
him where he stood, but long shadows trailed
down the walls and hung like a black canopy
above him. Barrymore had returned from taking
our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us
now with the subdued manner of a well-trained
servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,
handsome, with a square black beard and pale,
distinguished features.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you wish dinner to be served at once,
sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it ready?&#8221;
&#8220;In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot
</p>
<p>water in your rooms. My wife and I will be happy,
Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made
your fresh arrangements, but you will understand
that under the new conditions this house will re-
quire a considerable staff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What new conditions?&#8221;
&#8220;I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very re-
</p>
<p>tired life, and we were able to look after his wants.
You would, naturally, wish to have more company,
and so you will need changes in your household.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that your wife and you wish to
leave?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;But your family have been with us for several
</p>
<p>generations, have they not? I should be sorry to
begin my life here by breaking an old family con-
nection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I seemed to discern some signs of emotion
upon the butler&#8217;s white face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to
tell the truth, sir, we were both very much attached
to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and
made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear
that we shall never again be easy in our minds at
Baskerville Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you intend to do?&#8221;
&#8220;I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed
</p>
<p>in establishing ourselves in some business. Sir
Charles&#8217;s generosity has given us the means to do
</p>
<p>613</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to
your rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A square balustraded gallery ran round the top
of the old hall, approached by a double stair. From
this central point two long corridors extended the
whole length of the building, from which all the
bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing
as Baskerville&#8217;s and almost next door to it. These
rooms appeared to be much more modern than
the central part of the house, and the bright paper
and numerous candles did something to remove
the sombre impression which our arrival had left
upon my mind.
</p>
<p>But the dining-room which opened out of the
hall was a place of shadow and gloom. It was
a long chamber with a step separating the dais
where the family sat from the lower portion re-
served for their dependents. At one end a min-
strel&#8217;s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot
across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened
ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches
to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of
an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but
now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the
little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one&#8217;s
voice became hushed and one&#8217;s spirit subdued. A
dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress,
from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Re-
gency, stared down upon us and daunted us by
their silent company. We talked little, and I for one
was glad when the meal was over and we were
able to retire into the modern billiard-room and
smoke a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My word, it isn&#8217;t a very cheerful place,&#8221; said
Sir Henry. &#8220;I suppose one can tone down to it, but
I feel a bit out of the picture at present. I don&#8217;t
wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived
all alone in such a house as this. However, if it
suits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps
things may seem more cheerful in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed
and looked out from my window. It opened upon
the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door.
Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung
in a rising wind. A half moon broke through the
rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I saw be-
yond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the
long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I closed
the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in
keeping with the rest.
</p>
<p>And yet it was not quite the last. I found my-
self weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from
side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not
come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the
quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly si-
lence lay upon the old house. And then suddenly,
in the very dead of the night, there came a sound
to my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It
was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling
gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sor-
row. I sat up in bed and listened intently. The
noise could not have been far away and was cer-
tainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with
every nerve on the alert, but there came no other
sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the
ivy on the wall.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
The Stapletons of Merripit House
</p>
<p>The fresh beauty of the following morning did
something to efface from our minds the grim and
gray impression which had been left upon both
of us by our first ex
