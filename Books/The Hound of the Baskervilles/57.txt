<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s whim, Dr. Watson. When you
know me better you will understand that I cannot
always give reasons for what I say or do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice.
I remember the look in your eyes. Please, please,
be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since
I have been here I have been conscious of shad-
ows all round me. Life has become like that
great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches ev-
erywhere into which one may sink and with no
guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was
that you meant, and I will promise to convey your
warning to Sir Henry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An expression of irresolution passed for an in-
stant over her face, but her eyes had hardened
again when she answered me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;My brother and I were very much shocked
by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very in-
timately, for his favourite walk was over the moor
to our house. He was deeply impressed with
the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must
be some grounds for the fears which he had ex-
pressed. I was distressed therefore when another
member of the family came down to live here, and
I felt that he should be warned of the danger which
he will run. That was all which I intended to con-
vey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the story of the hound?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe in such nonsense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do. If you have any influence with Sir
Henry, take him away from a place which has al-
ways been fatal to his family. The world is wide.
Why should he wish to live at the place of dan-
ger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir
Henry&#8217;s nature. I fear that unless you can give me
some more definite information than this it would
be impossible to get him to move.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say anything definite, for I do not
know anything definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would ask you one more question, Miss Sta-
pleton. If you meant no more than this when you
first spoke to me, why should you not wish your
brother to overhear what you said? There is noth-
ing to which he, or anyone else, could object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother is very anxious to have the Hall
inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the
poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry
if he knew that I have said anything which might
induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my
duty now and I will say no more. I must get back,
or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen
you. Good-bye!&#8220; She turned and had disappeared
in a few minutes among the scattered boulders,
while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued
my way to Baskerville Hall.

<p>CHAPTER VIII.
First Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>From this point onward I will follow the course
of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr.
Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the ta-
ble. One page is missing, but otherwise they are
exactly as written and show my feelings and sus-
picions of the moment more accurately than my
memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.
</p>
<p>Baskerville Hall, October 13th.
</p>
<p>My dear Holmes:
My previous letters and telegrams have kept you
pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in
</p>
<p>this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The
longer one stays here the more does the spirit of
the moor sink into one&#8217;s soul, its vastness, and also
its grim charm. When you are once out upon its
bosom you have left all traces of modern England
behind you, but on the other hand you are con-
scious everywhere of the homes and the work of
the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you
walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with
their graves and the huge monoliths which are
supposed to have marked their temples. As you
look at their gray stone huts against the scarred
hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and
</p>
<p>620</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>First Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out
from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on
to the string of his bow, you would feel that his
presence there was more natural than your own.
The strange thing is that they should have lived
so thickly on what must always have been most
unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could
imagine that they were some unwarlike and har-
ried race who were forced to accept that which
none other would occupy.
</p>
<p>All this, however, is foreign to the mission on
which you sent me and will probably be very un-
interesting to your severely practical mind. I can
still remember your complete indifference as to
whether the sun moved round the earth or the
earth round the sun. Let me, therefore, return to
the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.
</p>
<p>If you have not had any report within the last
few days it is because up to to-day there was noth-
ing of importance to relate. Then a very surpris-
ing circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you
in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in
touch with some of the other factors in the situa-
tion.
</p>
<p>One of these, concerning which I have said lit-
tle, is the escaped convict upon the moor. There
is strong reason now to believe that he has got
right away, which is a considerable relief to the
lonely householders of this district. A fortnight
has passed since his flight, during which he has
not been seen and nothing has been heard of him.
It is surely inconceivable that he could have held
out upon the moor during all that time. Of course,
so far as his concealment goes there is no diffi-
culty at all. Any one of these stone huts would
give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to
eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of
the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has
gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in
consequence.
</p>
<p>We are four able-bodied men in this household,
so that we could take good care of ourselves, but
I confess that I have had uneasy moments when
I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles
from any help. There are one maid, an old manser-
vant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a
very strong man. They would be helpless in the
hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill
criminal, if he could once effect an entrance. Both
Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situa-
tion, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom
should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would
not hear of it.
</p>
<p>The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins
to display a considerable interest in our fair neigh-
bour. It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs
heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like
him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful
woman. There is something tropical and exotic
about her which forms a singular contrast to her
cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives
the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very
marked influence over her, for I have seen her con-
tinually glance at him as she talked as if seeking
approbation for what she said. I trust that he is
kind to her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a
firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive
and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him
an interesting study.
</p>
<p>He came over to call upon Baskerville on that
first day, and the very next morning he took us
both to show us the spot where the legend of the
wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin.
It was an excursion of some miles across the moor
to a place which is so dismal that it might have
suggested the story. We found a short valley be-
tween rugged tors which led to an open, grassy
space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In
the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and
sharpened at the upper end, until they looked like
the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast.
In every way it corresponded with the scene of the
old tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and
asked Stapleton more than once whether he did
really believe in the possibility of the interference
of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke
lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in
earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but
it was easy to see that he said less than he might,
and that he would not express his whole opinion
out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet.
He told us of similar cases, where families had suf-
fered from some evil influence, and he left us with
the impression that he shared the popular view
upon the matter.
</p>
<p>On our way back we stayed for lunch at Mer-
ripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made
the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the
first moment that he saw her he appeared to be
strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken
if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her
again and again on our walk home, and since then
hardly a day has passed that we have not seen
something of the brother and sister. They dine
here to-night, and there is some talk of our go-
ing to them next week. One would imagine that
such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton,
and yet I have more than once caught a look of
</p>
<p>621</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir
Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.
He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would
lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem
the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the
way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I
am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to
ripen into love, and I have several times observed
that he has taken pains to prevent them from be-
ing te&#770;te-a&#768;-te&#770;te. By the way, your instructions to me
never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will be-
come very much more onerous if a love affair were
to be added to our other difficulties. My popular-
ity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your
orders to the letter.
</p>
<p>The other day&#8212;Thursday, to be more ex-
act&#8212;Dr. Mortimer lunched with us. He has been
excavating a barrow at Long Down, and has got
a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy.
Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast
as he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at
Sir Henry&#8217;s request, to show us exactly how ev-
erything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a
long, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two
high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band
of grass upon either side. At the far end is an old
tumble-down summer-house. Half-way down is
the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his
cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a latch.
Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your
theory of the affair and tried to picture all that
had occurred. As the old man stood there he
saw something coming across the moor, something
which terrified him so that he lost his wits, and ran
and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaus-
tion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down
which he fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of
the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and
monstrous? Was there a human agency in the mat-
ter? Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more
than he cared to say? It was all dim and vague, but
always there is the dark shadow of crime behind
it.
</p>
<p>One other neighbour I have met since I wrote
last. This is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who
lives some four miles to the south of us. He is an
elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric.
His passion is for the British law, and he has spent
a large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere
pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take
up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder
that he has found it a costly amusement. Some-
times he will shut up a right of way and defy the
parish to make him open it. At others he will with
</p>
<p>his own hands tear down some other man&#8217;s gate
and declare that a path has existed there from time
immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him
for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and
communal rights, and he applies his knowledge
sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy
and sometimes against them, so that he is period-
ically either carried in triumph down the village
street or else burned in effigy, according to his lat-
est exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits
upon his hands at present, which will probably
swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so
draw his sting and leave him harmless for the fu-
ture. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-
natured person, and I only mention him because
you were particular that I should send some de-
scription of the people who surround us. He is
curiously employed at present, for, being an am-
ateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope,
with which he lies upon the roof of his own house
and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catch-
ing a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would
confine his energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr.
Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent
of the next-of-kin, because he dug up the Neolithic
skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to
keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a
little comic relief where it is badly needed.
</p>
<p>And now, having brought you up to date in
the escaped convict, the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer,
and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on that
which is most important and tell you more about
the Barrymores, and especially about the surpris-
ing development of last night.
</p>
<p>First of all about the test telegram, which you
sent from London in order to make sure that Bar-
rymore was really here. I have already explained
that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the
test was worthless and that we have no proof one
way or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter
stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion,
had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had
received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that
he had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?&#8221;
asked Sir Henry.
</p>
<p>Barrymore looked surprised, and considered
for a little time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I was in the box-room at the
time, and my wife brought it up to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you answer it yourself?&#8221;
&#8220;No; I told my wife what to answer and she
</p>
<p>went down to write it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>622</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>In the evening he recurred to the subject of his
own accord.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not quite understand the object of your
questions this morning, Sir Henry,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
trust that they do not mean that I have done any-
thing to forfeit your confidence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so
and pacify him by giving him a considerable part
of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now
all arrived.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is
a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely re-
spectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet
I have told you how, on the first night here, I
heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have
more
