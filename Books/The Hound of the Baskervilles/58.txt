<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>In the evening he recurred to the subject of his
own accord.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not quite understand the object of your
questions this morning, Sir Henry,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
trust that they do not mean that I have done any-
thing to forfeit your confidence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so
and pacify him by giving him a considerable part
of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now
all arrived.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is
a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely re-
spectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet
I have told you how, on the first night here, I
heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have
more than once observed traces of tears upon her
face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart.
Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory
which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barry-
more of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt
that there was something singular and question-
able in this man&#8217;s character, but the adventure of
last night brings all my suspicions to a head.
</p>
<p>And yet it may seem a small matter in itself.
You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper,
and since I have been on guard in this house my
slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,
about two in the morning, I was aroused by a
stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my
door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was
trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man
who walked softly down the passage with a can-
dle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers,
with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the
outline, but his height told me that it was Barry-
more. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,
</p>
<p>and there was something indescribably guilty and
furtive in his whole appearance.
</p>
<p>I have told you that the corridor is broken by
the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it
is resumed upon the farther side. I waited until he
had passed out of sight and then I followed him.
When I came round the balcony he had reached
the end of the farther corridor, and I could see
from the glimmer of light through an open door
that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all
these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied, so
that his expedition became more mysterious than
ever. The light shone steadily as if he were stand-
ing motionless. I crept down the passage as noise-
lessly as I could and peeped round the corner of
the door.
</p>
<p>Barrymore was crouching at the window with
the candle held against the glass. His profile was
half turned towards me, and his face seemed to
be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the
blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood
watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and
with an impatient gesture he put out the light. In-
stantly I made my way back to my room, and very
shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more
upon their return journey. Long afterwards when
I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn
somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence
the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess,
but there is some secret business going on in this
house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get
to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my the-
ories, for you asked me to furnish you only with
facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this
morning, and we have made a plan of campaign
founded upon my observations of last night. I will
not speak about it just now, but it should make my
next report interesting reading.

<p>CHAPTER IX.
Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR
</p>
<p>Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.
</p>
<p>My dear Holmes:
If I was compelled to leave you without much
news during the early days of my mission you
</p>
<p>must acknowledge that I am making up for lost
time, and that events are now crowding thick and
fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my
top note with Barrymore at the window, and now
I have quite a budget already which will, unless
</p>
<p>623</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.
Things have taken a turn which I could not have
anticipated. In some ways they have within the
last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in
some ways they have become more complicated.
But I will tell you all and you shall judge for your-
self.
</p>
<p>Before breakfast on the morning following my
adventure I went down the corridor and examined
the room in which Barrymore had been on the
night before. The western window through which
he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one pe-
culiarity above all other windows in the house&#8212;it
commands the nearest outlook on the moor. There
is an opening between two trees which enables one
from this point of view to look right down upon it,
while from all the other windows it is only a dis-
tant glimpse which can be obtained. It follows,
therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window
would serve the purpose, must have been looking
out for something or somebody upon the moor.
The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imag-
ine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had
struck me that it was possible that some love in-
trigue was on foot. That would have accounted for
his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness
of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow,
very well equipped to steal the heart of a country
girl, so that this theory seemed to have something
to support it. That opening of the door which I
had heard after I had returned to my room might
mean that he had gone out to keep some clandes-
tine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the
morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspi-
cions, however much the result may have shown
that they were unfounded.
</p>
<p>But whatever the true explanation of Barry-
more&#8217;s movements might be, I felt that the respon-
sibility of keeping them to myself until I could ex-
plain them was more than I could bear. I had an
interview with the baronet in his study after break-
fast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less
surprised than I had expected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that Barrymore walked about nights,
and I had a mind to speak to him about it,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Two or three times I have heard his steps in
the passage, coming and going, just about the hour
you name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that
particular window,&#8221; I suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to
shadow him, and see what it is that he is after. I
wonder what your friend Holmes would do, if he
were here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that he would do exactly what you
now suggest,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He would follow Barrymore
and see what he did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall do it together.&#8221;
&#8220;But surely he would hear us.&#8221;
&#8220;The man is rather deaf, and in any case we
</p>
<p>must take our chance of that. We&#8217;ll sit up in my
room to-night and wait until he passes.&#8221; Sir Henry
rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evi-
dent that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his
somewhat quiet life upon the moor.
</p>
<p>The baronet has been in communication with
the architect who prepared the plans for Sir
Charles, and with a contractor from London, so
that we may expect great changes to begin here
soon. There have been decorators and furnishers
up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend
has large ideas, and means to spare no pains or ex-
pense to restore the grandeur of his family. When
the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he
will need will be a wife to make it complete. Be-
tween ourselves there are pretty clear signs that
this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for
I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a
woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour,
Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love
does not run quite as smoothly as one would un-
der the circumstances expect. To-day, for example,
its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple,
which has caused our friend considerable perplex-
ity and annoyance.
</p>
<p>After the conversation which I have quoted
about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and
prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the
same.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, are you coming, Watson?&#8221; he asked,
looking at me in a curious way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends on whether you are going on
the moor,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you know what my instructions are. I
</p>
<p>am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly
Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and
especially that you should not go alone upon the
moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with
a pleasant smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Holmes, with all
his wisdom, did not foresee some things which
have happened since I have been on the moor. You
understand me? I am sure that you are the last
man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-
sport. I must go out alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>624</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>It put me in a most awkward position. I was at
a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had
made up my mind he picked up his cane and was
gone.
</p>
<p>But when I came to think the matter over my
conscience reproached me bitterly for having on
any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I
imagined what my feelings would be if I had to
return to you and to confess that some misfortune
had occurred through my disregard for your in-
structions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the
very thought. It might not even now be too late to
overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of
Merripit House.
</p>
<p>I hurried along the road at the top of my speed
without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came
to the point where the moor path branches off.
There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the
wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from
which I could command a view&#8212;the same hill
which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw
him at once. He was on the moor path, about a
quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side
who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear
that there was already an understanding between
them and that they had met by appointment. They
were walking slowly along in deep conversation,
and I saw her making quick little movements of
her hands as if she were very earnest in what she
was saying, while he listened intently, and once
or twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood
among the rocks watching them, very much puz-
zled as to what I should do next. To follow them
and break into their intimate conversation seemed
to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never
for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the
spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could
see no better course than to observe him from the
hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to
him afterwards what I had done. It is true that
if any sudden danger had threatened him I was
too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that
you will agree with me that the position was very
difficult, and that there was nothing more which I
could do.
</p>
<p>Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted
on the path and were standing deeply absorbed
in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware
that I was not the only witness of their interview.
A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye,
and another glance showed me that it was carried
on a stick by a man who was moving among the
broken ground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-
net. He was very much closer to the pair than I
</p>
<p>was, and he appeared to be moving in their di-
rection. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew
Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round
her, but it seemed to me that she was straining
away from him with her face averted. He stooped
his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in
protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and
turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of
the interruption. He was running wildly towards
them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He
gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in
front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could
not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton
was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations,
which became more angry as the other refused to
accept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence.
Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beck-
oned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after
an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the
side of her brother. The naturalist&#8217;s angry gestures
showed that the lady was included in his displea-
sure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after
them, and then he walked slowly back the way that
he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of
dejection.
</p>
<p>What all this meant I could not imagine, but
I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so inti-
mate a scene without my friend&#8217;s knowledge. I
ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at
the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and
his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his
wit&#8217;s ends what to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped
from?&#8221; said he. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that you
came after me in spite of all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I explained everything to him: how I had found
it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed
him, and how I had witnessed all that had oc-
curred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but
my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at
last into a rather rueful laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have thought the middle of that
prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but, by thunder, the whole country-side
seems to have been out to see me do my woo-
ing&#8212;and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where
had you engaged a seat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on that hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was
well up to the front. Did you see him come out on
us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>625</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ever strike you as being crazy&#8212;this
brother of hers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that he ever did.&#8221;
&#8220;I dare say not. I always thought him sane
</p>
<p>enough until to-day, but you can take it from me
that either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket.
What&#8217;s the matter with me, anyhow? You&#8217;ve lived
near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight,
now! Is there anything that would prevent me
from making a good husband to a woman that I
loved?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not.&#8221;
&#8220;He can&#8217;t object to my worldly position, so it
</p>
<p>must be myself that he has this down on. What
has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in
my life that I know of. And yet he would not so
much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say so?&#8221;
&#8220;That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson,
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only known her these few weeks, but from the
first I just felt that she was made for me, and she,
too&#8212;she was happy when she was with me, and
that I&#8217;ll swear. There&#8217;s a light in a woman&#8217;s eyes
that speaks louder than words. But he has never
let us get together, and it was only to-day for the
first time that I saw a chance of having a few words
with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when
she did it was not love that she would talk about,
and she wouldn&#8217;t have let me talk about it either if
she could have stopped it. She kept coming back
to it that this was a place of danger, and that she
would never be happy until I had left it. I told
her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to
leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go,
the only way to work it was for her to arrange to
go with me. With that I offered in as many words
to marry her, but before she could answer, down
came this brother of hers, running at us with a
face on him like a madman. He was just white
with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing
with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How
dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful
to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet
I could do what I liked? If he had not been her
brother I should have known better how to answer
him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards
his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and
that I hoped that she might honour me by becom-
ing my wife. That seemed to make the matter no
better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered
him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, con-
sidering that she was standing by. So it ended by
his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I
as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just
</p>
<p>tell me what it all means, Watson, and I&#8217;ll owe you
more than ever I can hope to pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I
was completely puzzled myself. Our friend&#8217;s ti-
tle, his fortune, his age, his character, and his ap-
pearance are all in his favour, and I know noth-
ing against him unless it be this dark fate which
runs in his family. That his advances should be
rejected so brusquely without any reference to the
lady&#8217;s own wishes, and that the lady should ac-
cept the situation without protest, is very amaz-
ing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by
a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon.
He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness
of the morning, and after a long private interview
with Sir Henry in his study, the upshot of their
conversation was that the breach is quite healed,
and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Fri-
day as a sign of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say now that he isn&#8217;t a crazy man,&#8221;
said Sir Henry; &#8220;I can&#8217;t forget the look in his eyes
when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow
that no man could make a more handsome apol-
ogy than he has done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he give any explanation of his conduct?&#8221;
&#8220;His sister is everything in his life, he says.
</p>
<p>That is natural enough, and I am glad that he
should understand her value. They have always
been together, and according to his account he has
been a very lonely man with only her as a compan-
ion, so that the thought of losing her was really ter-
rible to him. He had not understood, he said, that
I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw
with his own eyes that it was really so, and that
she might be taken away from him, it gave him
such a shock that for a time he was not responsi-
ble for what he said or did. He was very sorry for
all that had passed, and he recognized how fool-
ish and how selfish it was that he should imagine
that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sis-
ter to himself for her whole life. If she had to leave
him he had rather it was to a neighbour like my-
self than to anyone else. But in any case it was a
blow to him, and it would take him some time be-
fore he could prepare himself to meet it. He would
withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would
promise for three months to let the matter rest and
to be content with cultivating the lady&#8217;s friendship
during that time without claiming her love. This I
promised, and so the matter rests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So there is one of our small mysteries cleared
up. It is something to have touched bottom any-
where in this bog in which we are floundering. We
know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour
upon his sister&#8217;s suitor&#8212;even when that suitor
</p>
<p>626</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I
pass on to another thread which I have extricated
out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs
in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Bar-
rymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the
western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear
Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed
you as an agent&#8212;that you do not regret the confi-
dence which you showed in me when you sent me
down. All these things have by one night&#8217;s work
been thoroughly cleared.
</p>
<p>I have said &#8220;by one night&#8217;s work,&#8221; but, in truth,
it was by two nights&#8217; work, for on the first we drew
entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms
until nearly three o&#8217;clock in the morning, but no
sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming
clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy
vigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in
our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged,
and we determined to try again. The next night
we lowered the lamp, and sat smoking cigarettes
without making the least sound. It was incredible
how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were
helped through it by the same sort of patient inter-
est which the hunter must feel as he watches the
trap into which he hopes the game may wander.
One struck, and two, and we had almost for the
second time given it up in despair, when in an in-
stant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs, with
all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more.
We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.
</p>
<p>Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it
died away in the distance. Then the baronet gently
opened his door and we set out in pursuit. Al-
ready our man had gone round the gallery, and
the corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole
along until we had come into the other wing. We
were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall,
black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded, as
he tip-toed down the passage. Then he passed
through the same door as before, and the light of
the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one
single yellow beam across the gloom of the corri-
dor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying ev-
ery plank before we dared to put our whole weight
upon it. We had taken the precaution of leaving
our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards
snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Some-
times it seemed impossible that he should fail to
hear our approach. However, the man is fortu-
nately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccu-
pied in that which he was doing. When at last we
reached the door and peeped through we found
him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his
</p>
<p>white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly
as I had seen him two nights before.
</p>
<p>We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the
baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is
always the most natural. He walked into the room,
and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the
window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood,
livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glar-
ing out of the white mask of his face, were full
of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir
Henry to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, Barrymore?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing, sir.&#8221; His agitation was so great that
</p>
<p>he could hardly speak, and the shadows sprang
up and down from the shaking of his candle. &#8220;It
was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that
they are fastened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the second floor?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir, all the windows.&#8221;
&#8220;Look here, Barrymore,&#8221; said Sir Henry,
</p>
<p>sternly; &#8220;we have made up our minds to have the
truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell
it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies!
What were you doing at that window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and
he wrung his hands together like one who is in the
last extremity of doubt and misery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a can-
dle to the window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why were you holding a candle to the
window?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, Sir Henry&#8212;don&#8217;t ask me! I give
you my word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that
I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but myself I
would not try to keep it from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the
candle from the trembling hand of the butler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have been holding it as a signal,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Let us see if there is any answer.&#8221; I held it as he
had done, and stared out into the darkness of the
night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of
the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for
the moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave
a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow
light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and
glowed steadily in the centre of the black square
framed by the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;No, no, sir, it is nothing&#8212;nothing at all!&#8221; the
</p>
<p>butler broke in; &#8220;I assure you, sir&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Move your light across the window, Watson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>cried the baronet. &#8220;See, the other moves also!
Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
</p>

</p>
<p>Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yon-
der, and what is this conspiracy that is going on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face became openly defiant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my business, and not yours. I will not
tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you leave my employment right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, sir. If I must I must.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may
well be ashamed of yourself. Your family has lived
with mine for over a hundred years under this
roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot
against me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, sir; no, not against you!&#8221; It was a
woman&#8217;s voice, and Mrs. Barrymore, paler and
more horror-struck than her husband, was stand-
ing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and
skirt might have been comic were it not for the in-
tensity of feeling upon her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You
can pack our things,&#8221; said the butler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It
is my doing, Sir Henry&#8212;all mine. He has done
nothing except for my sake and because I asked
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak out, then! What does it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My unhappy brother is starving on the moor.
We cannot let him perish at our very gates. The
light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,
and his light out yonder is to show the spot to
which to bring it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your brother is&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The escaped convict, sir&#8212;Selden, the crimi-
nal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the truth, sir,&#8221; said Barrymore. &#8220;I said
that it was not my secret and that I could not tell
it to you. But now you have heard it, and you will
see that if there was a plot it was not against you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy
expeditions at night and the light at the window.
Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in
amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly re-
spectable person was of the same blood as one of
the most notorious criminals in the country?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my
younger brother. We humoured him too much
when he was a lad, and gave him his own way
in everything until he came to think that the world
was made for his pleasure, and that he could do
what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met
wicked companions, and the devil entered into
him until he broke my mother&#8217;s heart and dragged
</p>
<p>our name in the dirt. From crime to crime he sank
lower and lower, until it is only the mercy of God
which has snatched him from the scaffold; but to
me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy
that I had nursed and played with, as an elder sis-
ter would. That was why he broke prison, sir.
He knew that I was here and that we could not
refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here
one night, weary and starving, with the warders
hard at his heels, what could we do? We took him
in and fed him and cared for him. Then you re-
turned, sir, and my brother thought he would be
safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue
and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there. But ev-
ery second night we made sure if he was still there
by putting a light in the window, and if there was
an answer my husband took out some bread and
meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was
gone, but as long as he was there we could not
desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an
honest Christian woman, and you will see that if
there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my
husband, but with me, for whose sake he has done
all that he has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s words came with an intense
earnestness which carried conviction with them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this true, Barrymore?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your
</p>
<p>own wife. Forget what I have said. Go to your
room, you two, and we shall talk further about this
matter in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they were gone we looked out of the
window again. Sir Henry had flung it open, and
the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far
away in the black distance there still glowed that
one tiny point of yellow light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder he dares,&#8221; said Sir Henry.
&#8220;It may be so placed as to be only visible from
</p>
<p>here.&#8221;
&#8220;Very likely. How far do you think it is?&#8221;
&#8220;Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.&#8221;
&#8220;Not more than a mile or two off.&#8221;
&#8220;Hardly that.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry
</p>
<p>out the food to it. And he is waiting, this villain,
beside that candle. By thunder, Watson, I am going
out to take that man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The same thought had crossed my own mind.
It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into
their confidence. Their secret had been forced from
them. The man was a danger to the community, an
unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither
pity nor excuse. We were only doing our duty in
</p>
<p>628</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Second Report of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>taking this chance of putting him back where he
could do no harm. With his brutal and violent na-
ture, others would have to pay the price if we held
our hands. Any night, for example, our neigh-
bours the Stapletons might be attacked by him,
and it may have been the thought of this which
made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Then get your revolver and put on your boots.
</p>
<p>The sooner we start the better, as the fellow may
put out his light and be off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In five minutes we were outside the door, start-
ing upon our expedition. We hurried through the
dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the au-
tumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The
night air was heavy with the smell of damp and
decay. Now and again the moon peeped out for
an instant, but clouds were driving over the face
of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor
a thin rain began to fall. The light still burned
steadily in front.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you armed?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;I have a hunting-crop.&#8221;
&#8220;We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said
</p>
<p>to be a desperate fellow. We shall take him by sur-
prise and have him at our mercy before he can re-
sist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Watson,&#8221; said the baronet, &#8220;what would
Holmes say to this? How about that hour of dark-
ness in which the power of evil is exalted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if in answer to his words there rose sud-
denly out of the vast gloom of the moor that
strange cry which I had already heard upon the
borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with
the wind through the silence of the night, a long,
deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan in which it died away. Again and again it
sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,
wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve
and his face glimmered white through the dark-
ness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, what&#8217;s that, Watson?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a sound they have on the
</p>
<p>moor. I heard it once before.&#8221;
It died away, and an absolute silence closed in
</p>
<p>upon us. We stood straining our ears, but nothing
came.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson,&#8221; said the baronet, &#8220;it was the cry of a
hound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a
break in his voice which told of the sudden horror
which had seized him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they call this sound?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Who?&#8221;
&#8220;The folk on the country-side.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should
</p>
<p>you mind what they call it?&#8221;
&#8220;Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?&#8221;
I hesitated but could not escape the question.
&#8220;They say it is the cry of the Hound of the
</p>
<p>Baskervilles.&#8221;
He groaned and was silent for a few moments.
&#8220;A hound it was,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;but it
</p>
<p>seemed to come from miles away, over yonder, I
think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hard to say whence it came.&#8221;
&#8220;It rose and fell with the wind. Isn&#8217;t that the
</p>
<p>direction of the great Grimpen Mire?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson,
</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t you think yourself that it was the cry of a
hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to
speak the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stapleton was with me when I heard it last.
He said that it might be the calling of a strange
bird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be
some truth in all these stories? Is it possible that
I am really in danger from so dark a cause? You
don&#8217;t believe it, do you, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221;
&#8220;And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in
</p>
<p>London, and it is another to stand out here in the
darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as
that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of
the hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together.
I don&#8217;t think that I am a coward, Watson, but that
sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my
hand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was as cold as a block of marble.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right to-morrow.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll get that cry out of my head.
</p>
<p>What do you advise that we do now?&#8221;
&#8220;Shall we turn back?&#8221;
&#8220;No, by thunder; we have come out to get our
</p>
<p>man, and we will do it. We after the convict, and
a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come on!
We&#8217;ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were
loose upon the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We stumbled slowly along in the darkness,
with the black loom of the craggy hills around us,
and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in
front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance
</p>
<p>629</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes
the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the hori-
zon and sometimes it might have been within a
few yards of us. But at last we could see whence
it came, and then we knew that we were indeed
very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a
crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side
so as to keep the wind from it and also to pre-
vent it from being visible, save in the direction of
Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed
our approach, and crouching behind it we gazed
over it at the signal light. It was strange to see
this single candle burning there in the middle of
the moor, with no sign of life near it&#8212;just the one
straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on
each side of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; whispered Sir Henry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us
see if we can get a glimpse of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of my mouth when
we both saw him. Over the rocks, in the crevice of
which the candle burned, there was thrust out an
evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed
and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire,
with a bristling beard, and hung with matted hair,
it might well have belonged to one of those old
savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides.
The light beneath him was reflected in his small,
cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and
left through the darkness, like a crafty and savage
animal who has heard the steps of the hunters.
</p>
<p>Something had evidently aroused his suspi-
cions. It may have been that Barrymore had some
private signal which we had neglected to give, or
the fellow may have had some other reason for
thinking that all was not well, but I could read his
fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he might
dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I
sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the
same. At the same moment the convict screamed
out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splin-
tered up against the boulder which had sheltered
us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat,
strongly-built figure as he sprang to his feet and
turned to run. At the same moment by a lucky
chance the moon broke through the clouds. We
rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was
our man running with great speed down the other
side, springing over the stones in his way with the
activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of
my revolver might have crippled him, but I had
brought it only to defend myself if attacked, and
not to shoot an unarmed man who was running
away.
</p>
<p>We were both swift runners and in fairly good
training, but we soon found that we had no chance
of overtaking him. We saw him for a long time
in the moonlight until he was only a small speck
moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side
of a distant hill. We ran and ran until we were
completely blown, but the space between us grew
ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat panting on
two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in
the distance.
</p>
<p>And it was at this moment that there occurred a
most strange and unexpected thing. We had risen
from our rocks and were turning to go home, hav-
ing abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was
low upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a
granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its
silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony
statue on that shining back-ground, I saw the fig-
ure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was
a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never
in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I
could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man.
He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms
folded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding
over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite
which lay before him. He might have been the very
spirit of tha
