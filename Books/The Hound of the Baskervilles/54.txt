</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
Three Broken Threads
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable
degree, the power of detaching his mind at will.
For two hours the strange business in which we
had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and
he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the
modern Belgian masters. He would talk of noth-
ing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from
our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at
the Northumberland Hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting
you,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;He asked me to show you
up at once when you came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any objection to my looking at your
register?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least.&#8221;
The book showed that two names had been
</p>
<p>added after that of Baskerville. One was
Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the
other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Al-
ton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely that must be the same Johnson whom
I used to know,&#8221; said Holmes to the porter. &#8220;A
lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a
limp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a
very active gentleman, not older than yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you are mistaken about his trade?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years,
</p>
<p>and he is very well known to us.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem
</p>
<p>to remember the name. Excuse my curiosity, but
often in calling upon one friend one finds an-
other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was
once mayor of Gloucester. She always comes to us
when she is in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her ac-
quaintance. We have established a most important
fact by these questions, Watson,&#8221; he continued in
a low voice as we went upstairs together. &#8220;We
know now that the people who are so interested
in our friend have not settled down in his own ho-
tel. That means that while they are, as we have
seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally
anxious that he should not see them. Now, this is
a most suggestive fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it suggest?&#8221;
&#8220;It suggests&#8212;halloa, my dear fellow, what on
</p>
<p>earth is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As we came round the top of the stairs we had
run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself. His
face was flushed with anger, and he held an old
and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was
he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did
speak it was in a much broader and more Western
dialect than any which we had heard from him in
the morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker
in this hotel,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They&#8217;ll find they&#8217;ve
started in to monkey with the wrong man unless
they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can&#8217;t find
my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take
a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they&#8217;ve got a
bit over the mark this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still looking for your boot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and mean to find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, surely, you said that it was a new brown
boot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was, sir. And now it&#8217;s an old black one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! you don&#8217;t mean to say&#8212;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I do mean to say. I only had
three pairs in the world&#8212;the new brown, the old
black, and the patent leathers, which I am wearing.
Last night they took one of my brown ones, and
to-day they have sneaked one of the black. Well,
have you got it? Speak out, man, and don&#8217;t stand
staring!&#8221;
</p>
<p>An agitated German waiter had appeared upon
the scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel,
but I can hear no word of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, either that boot comes back before sun-
down or I&#8217;ll see the manager and tell him that I go
right straight out of this hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be found, sir&#8212;I promise you that if
you will have a little patience it will be found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind it is, for it&#8217;s the last thing of mine that I&#8217;ll
lose in this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes,
you&#8217;ll excuse my troubling you about such a tri-
fle&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s well worth troubling about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you look very serious over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you explain it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t attempt to explain it. It seems the
very maddest, queerest thing that ever happened
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>606</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Three Broken Threads
</p>
<p>&#8220;The queerest perhaps&#8212;&#8221; said Holmes,
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t profess to understand it yet. This
case of yours is very complex, Sir Henry. When
taken in conjunction with your uncle&#8217;s death I am
not sure that of all the five hundred cases of cap-
ital importance which I have handled there is one
which cuts so deep. But we hold several threads
in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of
them guides us to the truth. We may waste time
in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we
must come upon the right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had a pleasant luncheon in which little
was said of the business which had brought us
together. It was in the private sitting-room to
which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked
Baskerville what were his intentions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To go to Baskerville Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the whole,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;I think that
your decision is a wise one. I have ample evidence
that you are being dogged in London, and amid
the millions of this great city it is difficult to dis-
cover who these people are or what their object can
be. If their intentions are evil they might do you
a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent
it. You did not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were
followed this morning from my house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer started violently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Followed! By whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you.
Have you among your neighbours or acquain-
tances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full
beard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8212;or, let me see&#8212;why, yes. Barrymore, Sir
Charles&#8217;s butler, is a man with a full, black beard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Where is Barrymore?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in charge of the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had best ascertain if he is really there, or
if by any possibility he might be in London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a telegraph form. &#8216;Is all ready for Sir
Henry?&#8217; That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore,
Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest telegraph-
office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second
wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: &#8216;Telegram to Mr.
Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If
absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel.&#8217; That should let us know
</p>
<p>before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in
Devonshire or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Baskerville. &#8220;By the way, Dr.
Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead.
They have looked after the Hall for four genera-
tions now. So far as I know, he and his wife are as
respectable a couple as any in the county.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time,&#8221; said Baskerville, &#8220;it&#8217;s clear
enough that so long as there are none of the family
at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home
and nothing to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;
&#8220;Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles&#8217;s
</p>
<p>will?&#8221; asked Holmes.
&#8220;He and his wife had five hundred pounds
</p>
<p>each.&#8221;
&#8220;Ha! Did they know that they would receive
</p>
<p>this?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about
</p>
<p>the provisions of his will.&#8221;
&#8220;That is very interesting.&#8221;
&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Dr. Mortimer, &#8220;that you do not
</p>
<p>look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who re-
ceived a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a
thousand pounds left to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! And anyone else?&#8221;
&#8220;There were many insignificant sums to indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, and a large number of public charities.
The residue all went to Sir Henry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how much was the residue?&#8221;
&#8220;Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.&#8221;
Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. &#8220;I had
</p>
<p>no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,&#8221; said
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich,
but we did not know how very rich he was until
we came to examine his securities. The total value
of the estate was close on to a million.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might
well play a desperate game. And one more ques-
tion, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything hap-
pened to our young friend here&#8212;you will for-
give the unpleasant hypothesis!&#8212;who would in-
herit the estate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles&#8217;s
younger brother died unmarried, the estate would
descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins.
James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in West-
moreland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. These details are all of great inter-
est. Have you met Mr. James Desmond?&#8221;
</p>
<p>607</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles.
He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly
life. I remember that he refused to accept any
settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it
upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this man of simple tastes would be the
heir to Sir Charles&#8217;s thousands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would be the heir to the estate because
that is entailed. He would also be the heir to
the money unless it were willed otherwise by the
present owner, who can, of course, do what he
likes with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you made your will, Sir Henry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I&#8217;ve had no time,
for it was only yesterday that I learned how mat-
ters stood. But in any case I feel that the money
should go with the title and estate. That was my
poor uncle&#8217;s idea. How is the owner going to re-
store the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not
money enough to keep up the property? House,
land, and dollars must go together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind
with you as to the advisability of your going down
to Devonshire without delay. There is only one
provision which I must make. You certainly must
not go alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Mortimer returns with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend
to, and his house is miles away from yours. With
all the good will in the world he may be unable
to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with
you someone, a trusty man, who will be always by
your side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr.
Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour
to be present in person; but you can understand
that, with my extensive consulting practice and
with the constant appeals which reach me from
many quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent
from London for an indefinite time. At the present
instant one of the most revered names in England
is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I
can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how
impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom would you recommend, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If my friend would undertake it there is no
man who is better worth having at your side when
you are in a tight place. No one can say so more
confidently than I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The proposition took me completely by sur-
prise, but before I had time to answer, Baskerville
seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Wat-
son,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You see how it is with me, and
you know just as much about the matter as I do.
If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see
me through I&#8217;ll never forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The promise of adventure had always a fascina-
tion for me, and I was complimented by the words
of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the
baronet hailed me as a companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come, with pleasure,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I do not
know how I could employ my time better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will report very carefully to me,&#8221;
said Holmes. &#8220;When a crisis comes, as it will do,
I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by
Saturday all might be ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that suit Dr. Watson?&#8221;
&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;
&#8220;Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the
</p>
<p>contrary, we shall meet at the 10.30 train from
Paddington.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a
cry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners
of the room he drew a brown boot from under a
cabinet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My missing boot!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;May all our difficulties vanish as easily!&#8221; said
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes.
&#8220;But it is a very singular thing,&#8221; Dr. Mortimer
</p>
<p>remarked. &#8220;I searched this room carefully before
lunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so did I,&#8221; said Baskerville. &#8220;Every inch
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was certainly no boot in it then.&#8221;
&#8220;In that case the waiter must have placed it
</p>
<p>there while we were lunching.&#8221;
The German was sent for but professed to
</p>
<p>know nothing of the matter, nor could any in-
quiry clear it up. Another item had been added
to that constant and apparently purposeless se-
ries of small mysteries which had succeeded each
other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim
story of Sir Charles&#8217;s death, we had a line of in-
explicable incidents all within the limits of two
days, which included the receipt of the printed
letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the
loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old
black boot, and now the return of the new brown
boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove
back to Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn
brows and keen face that his mind, like my own,
was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme
</p>
<p>608</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Three Broken Threads
</p>
<p>into which all these strange and apparently dis-
connected episodes could be fitted. All afternoon
and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and
thought.
</p>
<p>Just before dinner two telegrams were handed
in. The first ran:
</p>
<p>Have just heard that Barrymore is at
the Hall.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Baskerville.
</p>
<p>The second:
</p>
<p>Visited twenty-three hotels as directed,
but sorry to report unable to trace cut
sheet of Times.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Cartwright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There go two of my threads, Watson. There
is nothing more stimulating than a case where ev-
erything goes against you. We must cast round for
another scent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have still the cabman who drove the spy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. I have wired to get his name and ad-
dress from the Official Registry. I should not be
surprised if this were an answer to my question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ring at the bell proved to be something
even more satisfactory than an answer, however,
for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow
entered who was evidently the man himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a message from the head office that a
gent at this address had been inquiring for 2704,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve driven my cab this seven years and
never a word of complaint. I came here straight
from the Yard to ask you to your face what you
had against me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing in the world against you, my
good man,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;On the contrary, I have
half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear
answer to my questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had a good day and no mistake,&#8221;
said the cabman, with a grin. &#8220;What was it you
wanted to ask, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all your name and address, in case I
want you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough.
My cab is out of Shipley&#8217;s Yard, near Waterloo Sta-
tion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who
came and watched this house at ten o&#8217;clock this
</p>
<p>morning and afterwards followed the two gentle-
men down Regent Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man looked surprised and a little embar-
rassed. &#8220;Why, there&#8217;s no good my telling you
things, for you seem to know as much as I do al-
ready,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The truth is that the gentleman
told me that he was a detective and that I was to
say nothing about him to anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My good fellow, this is a very serious busi-
ness, and you may find yourself in a pretty bad
position if you try to hide anything from me. You
say that your fare told you that he was a detec-
tive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he did.&#8221;
&#8220;When did he say this?&#8221;
&#8220;When he left me.&#8221;
&#8220;Did he say anything more?&#8221;
&#8220;He mentioned his name.&#8221;
Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he mentioned his name, did he? That was im-
prudent. What was the name that he mentioned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His name,&#8221; said the cabman, &#8220;was Mr. Sher-
lock Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Never have I seen my friend more completely
taken aback than by the cabman&#8217;s reply. For an
instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst
into a hearty laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A touch, Watson&#8212;an undeniable touch!&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own.
He got home upon me very prettily that time. So
his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that was the gentleman&#8217;s name.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up
</p>
<p>and all that occurred.&#8221;
&#8220;He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar
</p>
<p>Square. He said that he was a detective, and he
offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what
he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was
glad enough to agree. First we drove down to
the Northumberland Hotel and waited there un-
til two gentlemen came out and took a cab from
the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up
somewhere near here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This very door,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t be sure of that, but I dare say
</p>
<p>my fare knew all about it. We pulled up half-way
down the street and waited an hour and a half.
Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and
we followed down Baker Street and along&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;Until we got three-quarters down Regent
</p>
<p>Street. Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and
</p>
<p>609</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>he cried that I should drive right away to Water-
loo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up
the mare and we were there under the ten min-
utes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good
one, and away he went into the station. Only just
as he was leaving he turned round and he said:
&#8216;It might interest you to know that you have been
driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#8217; That&#8217;s how I come
to know the name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. And you saw no more of him?&#8221;
&#8220;Not after he went into the station.&#8221;
&#8220;And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock
</p>
<p>Holmes?&#8221;
The cabman scratched his head. &#8220;Well, he
</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t altogether such an easy gentleman to de-
scribe. I&#8217;d put him at forty years of age, and he
was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter
than you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he
had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a
pale face. I don&#8217;t know as I could say more than
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colour of his eyes?&#8221;
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say that.&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing more that you can remember?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir; nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There&#8217;s
another one waiting for you if you can bring any
more information. Good night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, sir, and thank you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes
turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a
rueful smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where
we began,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The cunning rascal! He knew
our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,
conjectured that I had got the number of the cab
and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent
back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson,
this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of
our steel. I&#8217;ve been checkmated in London. I can
only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I&#8217;m
not easy in my mind about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About sending you. It&#8217;s an ugly business,
Watson, an ugly dangerous business, and the more
I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear fellow, you
may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall
be very glad to have you back safe and sound in
Baker Street once more.&#8221;

<p>CHAPTER VI.
Baskerville Hall
</p>
<p>Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were
ready upon the appointed day, and we started as
arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his last
parting injunctions and advice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not bias your mind by suggesting theo-
ries or suspicions, Watson,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I wish you
simply to report facts in the fullest possible man-
ner to me, and you can leave me to do the theoriz-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of facts?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything which may seem to have a bear-
ing however indirect upon the case, and especially
the relations between young Baskerville and his
neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the
death of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries
</p>
<p>myself in the last few days, but the results have,
I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to
be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond,
who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of
a very amiable disposition, so that this persecu-
tion does not arise from him. I really think that
we may eliminate him entirely from our calcula-
tions. There remain the people who will actually
surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it not be well in the first place to get
rid of this Barrymore couple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means
