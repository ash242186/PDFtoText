<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it
may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly
convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his fam-
ily, and certainly the records which he was able to
give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The
idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted
him, and on more than one occasion he has asked
me whether I had on my medical journeys at night
ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying
of a hound. The latter question he put to me sev-
eral times, and always with a voice which vibrated
with excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can well remember driving up to his house
in the evening some three weeks before the fatal
event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had
descended from my gig and was standing in front
of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over
my shoulder, and stare past me with an expres-
sion of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round
and had just time to catch a glimpse of something
which I took to be a large black calf passing at the
head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he
that I was compelled to go down to the spot where
the animal had been and look around for it. It was
gone, however, and the incident appeared to make
the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with
him all the evening, and it was on that occasion,
to explain the emotion which he had shown, that
he confided to my keeping that narrative which
I read to you when first I came. I mention this
small episode because it assumes some importance
in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was
convinced at the time that the matter was entirely
trivial and that his excitement had no justification.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about
to go to London. His heart was, I knew, affected,
and the constant anxiety in which he lived, how-
ever chimerical the cause of it might be, was ev-
</p>
<p>idently having a serious effect upon his health. I
thought that a few months among the distractions
of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Sta-
pleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned
at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At
the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the night of Sir Charles&#8217;s death Barrymore
the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins
the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting
up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within
an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated
all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest.
I followed the footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw
the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have
waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the
prints after that point, I noted that there were no
other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft
gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body,
which had not been touched until my arrival. Sir
Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers
dug into the ground, and his features convulsed
with some strong emotion to such an extent that I
could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was
certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one
false statement was made by Barrymore at the in-
quest. He said that there were no traces upon the
ground round the body. He did not observe any.
But I did&#8212;some little distance off, but fresh and
clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Footprints?&#8221;
&#8220;Footprints.&#8221;
&#8220;A man&#8217;s or a woman&#8217;s?&#8221;
Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an in-
</p>
<p>stant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he
answered:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gi-
gantic hound!&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
The Problem
</p>
<p>I confess at these words a shudder passed
through me. There was a thrill in the doctor&#8217;s
voice which showed that he was himself deeply
moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned
forward in his excitement and his eyes had the
</p>
<p>hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he
was keenly interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw this?&#8221;
&#8220;As clearly as I see you.&#8221;
&#8220;And you said nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>596</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the use?&#8221;
&#8220;How was it that no one else saw it?&#8221;
&#8220;The marks were some twenty yards from the
</p>
<p>body and no one gave them a thought. I don&#8217;t sup-
pose I should have done so had I not known this
legend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?&#8221;
&#8220;No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.&#8221;
&#8220;You say it was large?&#8221;
&#8220;Enormous.&#8221;
&#8220;But it had not approached the body?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8220;
&#8220;What sort of night was it?&#8221;
&#8220;Damp and raw.&#8221;
&#8220;But not actually raining?&#8221;
&#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;What is the Alley like?&#8221;
&#8220;There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve
</p>
<p>feet high and impenetrable. The walk in the centre
is about eight feet across.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything between the hedges and the
walk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet
broad on either side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated
at one point by a gate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the
moor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any other opening?&#8221;
&#8220;None.&#8221;
&#8220;So that to reach the Yew Alley one either has
</p>
<p>to come down it from the house or else to enter it
by the moor-gate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an exit through a summer-house at
the far end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had Sir Charles reached this?&#8221;
&#8220;No; he lay about fifty yards from it.&#8221;
&#8220;Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer&#8212;and this is im-
</p>
<p>portant&#8212;the marks which you saw were on the
path and not on the grass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No marks could show on the grass.&#8221;
&#8220;Were they on the same side of the path as the
</p>
<p>moor-gate?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the
</p>
<p>same side as the moor-gate.&#8221;
&#8220;You interest me exceedingly. Another point.
</p>
<p>Was the wicket-gate closed?&#8221;
&#8220;Closed and padlocked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How high was it?&#8221;
&#8220;About four feet high.&#8221;
&#8220;Then anyone could have got over it?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;And what marks did you see by the wicket-
</p>
<p>gate?&#8221;
&#8220;None in particular.&#8221;
&#8220;Good heaven! Did no one examine?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I examined myself.&#8221;
&#8220;And found nothing?&#8221;
&#8220;It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evi-
</p>
<p>dently stood there for five or ten minutes.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;
&#8220;Because the ash had twice dropped from his
</p>
<p>cigar.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after
</p>
<p>our own heart. But the marks?&#8221;
&#8220;He had left his own marks all over that small
</p>
<p>patch of gravel. I could discern no others.&#8221;
Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his
</p>
<p>knee with an impatient gesture.
&#8220;If I had only been there!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is ev-
</p>
<p>idently a case of extraordinary interest, and one
which presented immense opportunities to the sci-
entific expert. That gravel page upon which I
might have read so much has been long ere this
smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of
curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer,
to think that you should not have called me in! You
have indeed much to answer for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without
disclosing these facts to the world, and I have al-
ready given my reasons for not wishing to do so.
Besides, besides&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you hesitate?&#8221;
&#8220;There is a realm in which the most acute and
</p>
<p>most experienced of detectives is helpless.&#8221;
&#8220;You mean that the thing is supernatural?&#8221;
&#8220;I did not positively say so.&#8221;
&#8220;No, but you evidently think it.&#8221;
&#8220;Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have
</p>
<p>come to my ears several incidents which are hard
to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For example?&#8221;
&#8220;I find that before the terrible event occurred
</p>
<p>several people had seen a creature upon the moor
which corresponds with this Baskerville demon,
and which could not possibly be any animal
known to science. They all agreed that it was
a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral.
</p>
<p>597</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>I have cross-examined these men, one of them a
hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a
moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this
dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the
hell-hound of the legend. I assure you that there
is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a
hardy man who will cross the moor at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, a trained man of science, believe it
to be supernatural?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what to believe.&#8221;
Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;I have hitherto confined my investigations to
</p>
<p>this world,&#8221; said he. &#8220;In a modest way I have com-
bated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself
would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you
must admit that the footmark is material.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The original hound was material enough to
tug a man&#8217;s throat out, and yet he was diabolical
as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that you have quite gone over to the su-
pernaturalists. But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this.
If you hold these views, why have you come to
consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath
that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles&#8217;s death,
and that you desire me to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say that I desired you to do it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then, how can I assist you?&#8221;
&#8220;By advising me as to what I should do with
</p>
<p>Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Sta-
tion&#8221;&#8212;Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch&#8212;&#8220;in ex-
actly one hour and a quarter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He being the heir?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired
</p>
<p>for this young gentleman and found that he had
been farming in Canada. From the accounts which
have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee
and executor of Sir Charles&#8217;s will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other claimant, I presume?&#8221;
&#8220;None. The only other kinsman whom we
</p>
<p>have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville,
the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
Charles was the elder. The second brother, who
died young, is the father of this lad Henry. The
third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family.
He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain,
and was the very image, they tell me, of the family
picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to
hold him, fled to Central America, and died there
in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the
Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet
him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he
</p>
<p>arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
Holmes, what would you advise me to do with
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he not go to the home of his fa-
thers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems natural, does it not? And yet, con-
sider that every Baskerville who goes there meets
with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles
could have spoken with me before his death he
would have warned me against bringing this, the
last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth,
to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be de-
nied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak
country-side depends upon his presence. All the
good work which has been done by Sir Charles
will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by
my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is
why I bring the case before you and ask for your
advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes considered for a little time.
&#8220;Put into plain words, the matter is this,&#8221; said
</p>
<p>he. &#8220;In your opinion there is a diabolical agency
which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a
Baskerville&#8212;that is your opinion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I might go the length of saying that
there is some evidence that this may be so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural the-
ory be correct, it could work the young man evil
in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil with
merely local powers like a parish vestry would be
too inconceivable a thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You put the matter more flippantly, Mr.
Holmes, than you would probably do if you were
brought into personal contact with these things.
Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the
young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in Lon-
don. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you
recommend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call
off your spaniel who is scratching at my front
door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry
Baskerville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;
&#8220;And then you will say nothing to him at all
</p>
<p>until I have made up my mind about the matter.&#8221;
&#8220;How long will it take you to make up your
</p>
<p>mind?&#8221;
&#8220;Twenty-four hours. At ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow,
</p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you
will call upon me here, and it will be of help to
me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir
Henry Baskerville with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>598</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Problem
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do so, Mr. Holmes.&#8221; He scribbled the
appointment on his shirtcuff and hurried off in his
strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. Holmes
stopped him at the head of the stair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You
say that before Sir Charles Baskerville&#8217;s death sev-
eral people saw this apparition upon the moor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three people did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did any see it after?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not heard of any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Good morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet
look of inward satisfaction which meant that he
had a congenial task before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going out, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless I can help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action
that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, re-
ally unique from some points of view. When you
pass Bradley&#8217;s, would you ask him to send up a
pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you.
It would be as well if you could make it convenient
not to return before evening. Then I should be
very glad to compare impressions as to this most
interesting problem which has been submitted to
us this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I knew that seclusion and solitude were very
necessary for my friend in those hours of intense
mental concentration during which he weighed
every particle of evidence, constructed alternative
theories, balanced one against the other, and made
up his mind as to which points were essential and
which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at
my club and did not return to Baker Street until
evening. It was nearly nine o&#8217;clock when I found
myself in
