<p>it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and
watching and waiting! What&#8217;s he waiting for?
What does it mean? It means no good to anyone
of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be
to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry&#8217;s new
servants are ready to take over the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But about this stranger,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Can you tell
me anything about him? What did Selden say?
Did he find out where he hid, or what he was do-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep
one, and gives nothing away. At first he thought
that he was the police, but soon he found that he
had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he
was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing
he could not make out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did he say that he lived?&#8221;
&#8220;Among the old houses on the hillside&#8212;the
</p>
<p>stone huts where the old folk used to live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about his food?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Selden found out that he has got a lad who
works for him and brings him all he needs. I dare
say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of
this some other time.&#8221; When the butler had gone
I walked over to the black window, and I looked
through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and
at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It
is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in
a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of ha-
tred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a
place at such a time! And what deep and earnest
purpose can he have which calls for such a trial!
There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the
very centre of that problem which has vexed me
so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have
passed before I have done all that man can do to
reach the heart of the mystery.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.
The Man on the Tor
</p>
<p>The extract from my private diary which forms
the last chapter has brought my narrative up to
the 18th of October, a time when these strange
events began to move swiftly towards their ter-
rible conclusion. The incidents of the next few
days are indelibly graven upon my recollection,
and I can tell them without reference to the notes
made at the time. I start then from the day which
succeeded that upon which I had established two
facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura
Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles
Baskerville and made an appointment with him at
the very place and hour that he met his death, the
other that the lurking man upon the moor was to
be found among the stone huts upon the hill-side.
With these two facts in my possession I felt that
either my intelligence or my courage must be defi-
cient if I could not throw some further light upon
these dark places.
</p>
<p>I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I
had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening
before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at
cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,
I informed him about my discovery, and asked
</p>
<p>him whether he would care to accompany me to
Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager to
come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both
of us that if I went alone the results might be bet-
ter. The more formal we made the visit the less
information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry be-
hind, therefore, not without some prickings of con-
science, and drove off upon my new quest.
</p>
<p>When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins
to put up the horses, and I made inquiries for the
lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no
difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central
and well appointed. A maid showed me in with-
out ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room
a lady, who was sitting before a Remington type-
writer, sprang up with a pleasant smile of wel-
come. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I
was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked
me the object of my visit.
</p>
<p>The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was
one of extreme beauty. Her eyes and hair were
of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks,
though considerably freckled, were flushed with
the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty
</p>
<p>635</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.
Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But
the second was criticism. There was something
subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of
expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some
looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty.
But these, of course, are after-thoughts. At the mo-
ment I was simply conscious that I was in the pres-
ence of a very handsome woman, and that she was
asking me the reasons for my visit. I had not quite
understood until that instant how delicate my mis-
sion was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the pleasure,&#8221; said I, &#8220;of knowing your
father.&#8221; It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady
made me feel it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in common between my fa-
ther and me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I owe him nothing, and
his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late
Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts
I might have starved for all that my father cared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville
that I have come here to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The freckles started out on the lady&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I tell you about him?&#8221; she asked,
and her fingers played nervously over the stops of
her typewriter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew him, did you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have already said that I owe a great deal to
his kindness. If I am able to support myself it is
largely due to the interest which he took in my
unhappy situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you correspond with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady looked quickly up with an angry
gleam in her hazel eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the object of these questions?&#8221; she
asked sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is
better that I should ask them here than that the
matter should pass outside our control.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was silent and her face was still very pale.
At last she looked up with something reckless and
defiant in her manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll answer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What are your
questions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you correspond with Sir Charles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly wrote to him once or twice to ac-
knowledge his delicacy and his generosity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you the dates of those letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever met him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, once or twice, when he came into
Coombe Tracey. He was a very retiring man, and
he preferred to do good by stealth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so
seldom, how did he know enough about your af-
fairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has
done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She met my difficulty with the utmost readi-
ness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were several gentlemen who knew my
sad history and united to help me. One was Mr.
Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir
Charles&#8217;s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was
through him that Sir Charles learned about my af-
fairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had
made Stapleton his almoner upon several occa-
sions, so the lady&#8217;s statement bore the impress of
truth upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him
to meet you?&#8221; I continued.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again.
&#8220;Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary ques-
</p>
<p>tion.&#8221;
&#8220;I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then I answer, certainly not.&#8221;
&#8220;Not on the very day of Sir Charles&#8217;s death?&#8221;
The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly
</p>
<p>face was before me. Her dry lips could not speak
the &#8220;No&#8221; which I saw rather than heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely your memory deceives you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I
could even quote a passage of your letter. It ran
&#8216;Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this
letter, and be at the gate by ten o&#8217;clock.&#8216;&#8221;
</p>
<p>I thought that she had fainted, but she recov-
ered herself by a supreme effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no such thing as a gentleman?&#8221; she
gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn
the letter. But sometimes a letter may be legible
even when burned. You acknowledge now that
you wrote it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did write it,&#8221; she cried, pouring out her
soul in a torrent of words. &#8220;I did write it. Why
should I deny it? I have no reason to be ashamed
of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I
had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked
him to meet me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why at such an hour?&#8221;
&#8220;Because I had only just learned that he was
</p>
<p>going to London next day and might be away for
months. There were reasons why I could not get
there earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>636</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Man on the Tor
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why a rendezvous in the garden instead
of a visit to the house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think a woman could go alone at that
hour to a bachelor&#8217;s house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what happened when you did get
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyons!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I
never went. Something intervened to prevent my
going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You acknowledge then that you made an ap-
pointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and
place at which he met his death, but you deny that
you kept the appointment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I
could never get past that point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyons,&#8221; said I, as I rose from this long
and inconclusive interview, &#8220;you are taking a very
great responsibility and putting yourself in a very
false position by not making an absolutely clean
breast of all that you know. If I have to call in
the aid of the police you will find how seriously
you are compromised. If your position is innocent,
why did you in the first instance deny having writ-
ten to Sir Charles upon that date?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I feared that some false conclusion
might be drawn from it and that I might find my-
self involved in a scandal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why were you so pressing that Sir
Charles should destroy your letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have read the letter you will know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say that I had read all the letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You quoted some of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I
said, been burned and it was not all legible. I
ask you once again why it was that you were so
pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter
which he received on the day of his death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter is a very private one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The more reason why you should avoid a pub-
lic investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you, then. If you have heard any-
thing of my unhappy history you will know that I
made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My life has been one incessant persecution
from a husband whom I abhor. The law is upon his
side, and every day I am faced by the possibility
that he may force me to live with him. At the time
that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned
that there was a prospect of my regaining my free-
dom if certain expenses could be met. It meant
everything to me&#8212;peace of mind, happiness, self-
respect&#8212;everything. I knew Sir Charles&#8217;s generos-
ity, and I thought that if he heard the story from
my own lips he would help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how is it that you did not go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I received help in the interval from
another source.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles
and explain this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should have done had I not seen his death
in the paper next morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s story hung coherently together,
and all my questions were unable to shake it.
I could only check it by finding if she had, in-
deed, instituted divorce proceedings against her
husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
</p>
<p>It was unlikely that she would dare to say that
she had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really
had been, for a trap would be necessary to take
her there, and could not have returned to Coombe
Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such
an excursion could not be kept secret. The proba-
bility was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,
or, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled
and disheartened. Once again I had reached that
dead wall which seemed to be built across every
path by which I tried to get at the object of my
mission. And yet the more I thought of the lady&#8217;s
face and of her manner the more I felt that some-
thing was being held back from me. Why should
she turn so pale? Why should she fight against ev-
ery admission until it was forced from her? Why
should she have been so reticent at the time of the
tragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could
not be as innocent as she would have me believe.
For the moment I could proceed no farther in that
direction, but must turn back to that other clue
which was to be sought for among the stone huts
upon the moor.
</p>
<p>And that was a most vague direction. I real-
ized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill
showed traces of the ancient people. Barrymore&#8217;s
only indication had been that the stranger lived in
one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds
of them are scattered throughout the length and
breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience
</p>
<p>637</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>for a guide since it had shown me the man himself
standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That
then should be the centre of my search. From there
I should explore every hut upon the moor until I
lighted upon the right one. If this man were in-
side it I should find out from his own lips, at the
point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and
why he had dogged us so long. He might slip
away from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it
would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor.
On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its
tenant should not be within it I must remain there,
however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes
had missed him in London. It would indeed be a
triumph for me if I could run him to earth, where
my master had failed.
</p>
<p>Luck had been against us again and again in
this inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid.
And the messenger of good fortune was none
other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-
whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his
garden, which opened on to the high road along
which I travelled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day, Dr. Watson,&#8221; cried he with un-
wonted good humour, &#8220;you must really give your
horses a rest, and come in to have a glass of wine
and to congratulate me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My feelings towards him were very far from be-
ing friendly after what I had heard of his treatment
of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins
and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was
a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir
Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner.
Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great day for me, sir&#8212;one of the red-
letter days of my life,&#8221; he cried with many chuck-
les. &#8220;I have brought off a double event. I mean to
teach them in these parts that law is law, and that
there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it.
I have established a right of way through the centre
of old Middleton&#8217;s park, slap across it, sir, within
a hundred yards of his own front door. What do
you think of that? We&#8217;ll teach these magnates that
they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the
commoners, confound them! And I&#8217;ve closed the
wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic.
These infernal people seem to think that there are
no rights of property, and that they can swarm
where they like with their papers and their bot-
tles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and both in
my favour. I haven&#8217;t had such a day since I had Sir
John Morland for trespass, because he shot in his
own warren.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth did you do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay
reading&#8212;Frankland v. Morland, Court of Queen&#8217;s
Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my ver-
dict.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it do you any good?&#8221;
&#8220;None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had
</p>
<p>no interest in the matter. I act entirely from a sense
of public duty. I have no doubt, for example, that
the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-
night. I told the police last time they did it that
they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The
County Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir,
and it has not afforded me the protection to which
I am entitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will
bring the matter before the attention of the public.
I told them that they would have occasion to regret
their treatment of me, and already my words have
come true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; I asked.
The old man put on a very knowing expression.
&#8220;Because I could tell them what they are dying
</p>
<p>to know; but nothing would induce me to help the
rascals in any way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had been casting round for some excuse by
which I could get away from his gossip, but now
I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen
enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to
understand that any strong sign of interest would
be the surest way to stop his confidences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some poaching case, no doubt?&#8221; said I, with
an indifferent manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important
matter than that! What about the convict on the
moor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I started. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you know
where he is?&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not know exactly where he is, but I am
quite sure that I could help the police to lay their
hands on him. Has it never struck you that the
way to catch that man was to find out where he
got his food, and so trace it to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfort-
ably near the truth. &#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but how
do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it because I have seen with my own
eyes the messenger who takes him his food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious
thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busy-
body. But his next remark took a weight from my
mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be surprised to hear that his food is
taken to him by a child. I see him every day
through my telescope upon the roof. He passes
</p>
<p>638</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Man on the Tor
</p>
<p>along the same path at the same hour, and to
whom should he be going except to the convict?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed
all appearance of interest. A child! Barrymore
had said that our unknown was supplied by a
boy. It was on his track, and not upon the con-
vict&#8217;s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get
his knowledge it might save me a long and weary
hunt. But incredulity and indifference were evi-
dently my strongest cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say that it was much more likely that
it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds
taking out his father&#8217;s dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The least appearance of opposition struck fire
out of the old autocrat. His eyes looked malig-
nantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like
those of an angry cat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir!&#8221; said he, pointing out over the
wide-stretching moor. &#8220;Do you see that Black Tor
over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill be-
yond with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest
part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a
shepherd would be likely to take his station? Your
suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I meekly answered that I had spoken without
knowing all the facts. My submission pleased him
and led him to further confidences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure, sir, that I have very good
grounds before I come to an opinion. I have seen
the boy again and again with his bundle. Ev-
ery day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been
able&#8212;but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my
eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment
something moving upon that hill-side?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was several miles off, but I could distinctly
see a small dark dot against the dull green and
gray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, sir, come!&#8221; cried Frankland, rushing
upstairs. &#8220;You will see with your own eyes and
judge for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The telescope, a formidable instrument
mounted upon a tripod, stood upon the flat leads
of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and
gave a cry of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes
over the hill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with
a little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly
up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant
against the cold blue sky. He looked round him
with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads
pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Am I right?&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have
</p>
<p>some secret errand.&#8221;
&#8220;And what the errand is even a county consta-
</p>
<p>ble could guess. But not one word shall they have
from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Wat-
son. Not a word! You understand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you wish.&#8221;
&#8220;They have treated me shamefully&#8212;shamefully.
</p>
<p>When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina
I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will
run through the country. Nothing would induce
me to help the police in any way. For all they cared
it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which
these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are
not going! You will help me to empty the decanter
in honour of this great occasion!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded
in dissuading him from his announced intention of
walking home with me. I kept the road as long as
his eye was on me, and then I struck off across
the moor and made for the stony hill over which
the boy had disappeared. Everything was work-
ing in my favour, and I swore that it should not
be through lack of energy or perseverance that I
should miss the chance which fortune had thrown
in my way.
</p>
<p>The sun was already sinking when I reached
the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath
me were all golden-green on one side and gray
shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the
farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic
shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide
expanse there was no sound and no movement.
One great gray bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft
in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the
only living things between the huge arch of the
sky and the desert beneath it. The barren scene,
the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and ur-
gency of my task all struck a chill into my heart.
The boy was nowhere to be seen. But down be-
neath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle
of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them
there was one which retained sufficient roof to act
as a screen against the weather. My heart leaped
within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow
where the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on
the threshold of his hiding place&#8212;his secret was
within my grasp.
</p>
<p>As I approached the hut, walking as warily as
Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew
near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that
the place had indeed been used as a habitation.
A vague pathway among the boulders led to the

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>dilapidated opening which served as a door. All
was silent within. The unknown might be lurking
there, or he might be prowling on the moor. My
nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throw-
ing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the
butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the
door, I looked in. The place was empty.
</p>
<p>But there were ample signs that I had not come
upon a false scent. This was certainly where the
man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof
lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic
man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were
heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cook-
ing utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A lit-
ter of empty tins showed that the place had been
occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes be-
came accustomed to the checkered light, a pan-
nikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in
the corner. In the middle of the hut a flat stone
served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood
a small cloth bundle&#8212;the same, no doubt, which I
had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder
of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned
tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I
set it down again, after having examined it, my
heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet
of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this
was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil:&#8212;
</p>
<p>Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.
For a minute I stood there with the paper in
</p>
<p>my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt
message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who
was being dogged by this secret man. He had not
followed me himself, but he had set an agent&#8212;the
boy, perhaps&#8212;upon my track, and this was his re-
port. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been
upon the moor which had not been observed and
reported. Always there was this feeling of an un-
seen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite
skill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was
only at some supreme moment that one realized
that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.
</p>
<p>If there was one report there might be others,
so I looked round the hut in search of them. There
was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor
could I discover any sign which might indicate the
character or intentions of the man who lived in
this singular place, save that he must be of Spar-
tan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.
When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at
the gaping roof I understood how strong and im-
mutable must be the purpose which had kept him
in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant
enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel? I
swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.
</p>
<p>Outside the sun was sinking low and the west
was blazing with scarlet and gold. Its reflection
was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant
pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire.
There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and
there a distant blur of smoke which marked the
village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the
hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet
and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening
light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared
none of the peace of nature but quivered at the
vagueness and the terror of that interview which
every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling
nerves, but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess
of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the
coming of its tenant.
</p>
<p>And then at last I heard him. Far away came
the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone.
Then another and yet another, coming nearer and
nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner, and
cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to
discover myself until I had an opportunity of see-
ing something of the stranger. There was a long
pause which showed that he had stopped. Then
once more the footsteps approached and a shadow
fell across the opening of the hut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,&#8221; said a
well-known voice. &#8220;I really think that you will be
more comfortable outside than in.&#8221;

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.
Death on the Moor
</p>
<p>For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly
able to believe my ears. Then my senses and my
voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted
from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice
could belong to but one man in all the world.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holmes!&#8221; I cried&#8212;&#8220;Holmes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and please be careful
with the revolver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat
upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with
amusement as they fell upon my astonished fea-
tures. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert,
his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened
by the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he
looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and
he had contrived, with that cat-like love of per-
sonal cleanliness which was one of his character-
istics, that his chin should be as smooth and his
linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was more glad to see anyone in my
life,&#8221; said I, as I wrung him by the hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or more astonished, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The surprise was not all on one side, I assure
you. I had no idea that you had found my occa-
sional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until
I was within twenty paces of the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My footprint, I presume?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Watson; I fear that I could not under-
take to recognize your footprint amid all the foot-
prints of the world. If you seriously desire to de-
ceive me you must change your tobacconist; for
when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley,
Oxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is
in the neighbourhood. You will see it there be-
side the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at
that supreme moment when you charged into the
empty hut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought as much&#8212;and knowing your ad-
mirable tenacity I was convinced that you were
sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting
for the tenant to return. So you actually thought
that I was the criminal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know who you were, but I was de-
termined to find out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, Watson! And h
