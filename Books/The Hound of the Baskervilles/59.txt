<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite irrel-
evant, but still I feel that it is best that I should
let you have all the facts and leave you to select
for yourself those which will be of most service to
you in helping you to your conclusions. We are
certainly making some progress. So far as the Bar-
rymores go we have found the motive of their ac-
</p>
<p>tions, and that has cleared up the situation very
much. But the moor with its mysteries and its
strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever.
Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some
light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you
could come down to us. In any case you will hear
from me again in the course of the next few days.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.
Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>So far I have been able to quote from the re-
ports which I have forwarded during these early
days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have
arrived at a point in my narrative where I am com-
pelled to abandon this method and to trust once
more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
I kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter
will carry me on to those scenes which are indeli-
bly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I pro-
ceed, then, from the morning which followed our
abortive chase of the convict and our other strange
experiences upon the moor.
</p>
<p>October 16th.&#8212;A dull and foggy day with
a drizzle of rain. The house is banked in with
rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show
the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver
veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant
boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon
their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in.
The baronet is in a black reaction after the excite-
ments of the night. I am conscious myself of a
weight at my heart and a feeling of impending
danger&#8212;ever present danger, which is the more
terrible because I am unable to define it.
</p>
<p>And have I not cause for such a feeling? Con-
sider the long sequence of incidents which have all
pointed to some sinister influence which is at work
around us. There is the death of the last occupant
of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of
the family legend, and there are the repeated re-
ports from peasants of the appearance of a strange
creature upon the moor. Twice I have with my
own ears heard the sound which resembled the
distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impos-
sible, that it should really be outside the ordinary
laws of nature. A spectral hound which leaves
</p>
<p>material footmarks and fills the air with its howl-
ing is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may
fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also;
but if I have one quality upon earth it is common-
sense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in
such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the
level of these poor peasants, who are not content
with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe
him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and
eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and
I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice
heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose that
there were really some huge hound loose upon it;
that would go far to explain everything. But where
could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get
its food, where did it come from, how was it that
no one saw it by day? It must be confessed that
the natural explanation offers almost as many dif-
ficulties as the other. And always, apart from the
hound, there is the fact of the human agency in
London, the man in the cab, and the letter which
warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at least
was real, but it might have been the work of a pro-
tecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where is
that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in
London, or has he followed us down here? Could
he&#8212;could he be the stranger whom I saw upon
the tor?
</p>
<p>It is true that I have had only the one glance
at him, and yet there are some things to which I
am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have
seen down here, and I have now met all the neigh-
bours. The figure was far taller than that of Staple-
ton, far thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore
it might possibly have been, but we had left him
behind us, and I am certain that he could not have
followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,
</p>
<p>631</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have
never shaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon
that man, then at last we might find ourselves at
the end of all our difficulties. To this one purpose
I must now devote all my energies.
</p>
<p>My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my
plans. My second and wisest one is to play my
own game and speak as little as possible to any-
one. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been
strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I
will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will
take my own steps to attain my own end.
</p>
<p>We had a small scene this morning after break-
fast. Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir
Henry, and they were closeted in his study some
little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than
once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had
a pretty good idea what the point was which was
under discussion. After a time the baronet opened
his door and called for me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He thinks that it was unfair on our part
to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his
own free will, had told us the secret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The butler was standing very pale but very col-
lected before us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may have spoken too warmly, sir,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and if I have, I am sure that I beg your pardon.
At the same time, I was very much surprised when
I heard you two gentlemen come back this morn-
ing and learned that you had been chasing Selden.
The poor fellow has enough to fight against with-
out my putting more upon his track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had told us of your own free will
it would have been a different thing,&#8221; said the
baronet, &#8220;you only told us, or rather your wife
only told us, when it was forced from you and you
could not help yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you would have taken advan-
tage of it, Sir Henry&#8212;indeed I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man is a public danger. There are lonely
houses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow
who would stick at nothing. You only want to get a
glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Staple-
ton&#8217;s house, for example, with no one but himself
to defend it. There&#8217;s no safety for anyone until he
is under lock and key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll break into no house, sir. I give you my
solemn word upon that. But he will never trou-
ble anyone in this country again. I assure you, Sir
Henry, that in a very few days the necessary ar-
rangements will have been made and he will be
on his way to South America. For God&#8217;s sake, sir, I
</p>
<p>beg of you not to let the police know that he is still
on the moor. They have given up the chase there,
and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him.
You can&#8217;t tell on him without getting my wife and
me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to
the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say, Watson?&#8221;
I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;If he were safely
</p>
<p>out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of
a burden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about the chance of his holding
someone up before he goes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not do anything so mad, sir. We
have provided him with all that he can want. To
commit a crime would be to show where he was
hiding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Sir Henry. &#8220;Well, Barry-
more&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, sir, and thank you from my
heart! It would have killed my poor wife had he
been taken again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony,
Watson? But, after what we have heard I don&#8217;t feel
as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of
it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a few broken words of gratitude the man
turned, but he hesitated and then came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should
like to do the best I can for you in return. I know
something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have
said it before, but it was long after the inquest that
I found it out. I&#8217;ve never breathed a word about
it yet to mortal man. It&#8217;s about poor Sir Charles&#8217;s
death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The baronet and I were both upon our feet. &#8220;Do
you know how he died?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I don&#8217;t know that.&#8221;
&#8220;What then?&#8221;
&#8220;I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It
</p>
<p>was to meet a woman.&#8221;
&#8220;To meet a woman! He?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;And the woman&#8217;s name?&#8221;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you the name, sir, but I can give
</p>
<p>you the initials. Her initials were L. L.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know this, Barrymore?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that
</p>
<p>morning. He had usually a great many letters,
for he was a public man and well known for his
kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble
was glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it
chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took
</p>
<p>632</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
</p>
<p>the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey,
and it was addressed in a woman&#8217;s hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter,
and never would have done had it not been for
my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning
out Sir Charles&#8217;s study&#8212;it had never been touched
since his death&#8212;and she found the ashes of a
burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater
part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip,
the end of a page, hung together, and the writing
could still be read, though it was gray on a black
ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the
end of the letter, and it said: &#8216;Please, please, as you
are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate
by ten o&#8217;clock&#8217;. Beneath it were signed the initials
L. L.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got that slip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had Sir Charles received any other letters in
the same writing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his let-
ters. I should not have noticed this one, only it
happened to come alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have no idea who L. L. is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. No more than you have. But I ex-
pect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we
should know more about Sir Charles&#8217;s death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you
came to conceal this important information.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, it was immediately after that our
own trouble came to us. And then again, sir, we
were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we
well might be considering all that he has done for
us. To rake this up couldn&#8217;t help our poor master,
and it&#8217;s well to go carefully when there&#8217;s a lady in
the case. Even the best of us&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought it might injure his reputation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it.
But now you have been kind to us, and I feel as if
it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all
that I know about the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Barrymore; you can go.&#8221; When the
butler had left us Sir Henry turned to me. &#8220;Well,
Watson, what do you think of this new light?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker
than before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think. But if we can only trace L. L.
it should clear up the whole business. We have
gained that much. We know that there is someone
</p>
<p>who has the facts if we can only find her. What do
you think we should do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will
give him the clue for which he has been seeking. I
am much mistaken if it does not bring him down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I went at once to my room and drew up my
report of the morning&#8217;s conversation for Holmes.
It was evident to me that he had been very busy
of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street
were few and short, with no comments upon the
information which I had supplied and hardly any
reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmail-
ing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this
new factor must surely arrest his attention and re-
new his interest. I wish that he were here.
</p>
<p>October 17th.&#8212;All day to-day the rain
poured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping
from the eaves. I thought of the convict out
upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil!
Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something
to atone for them. And then I thought of that
other one&#8212;the face in the cab, the figure against
the moon. Was he also out in that deluged&#8212;the
unseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the
evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far
upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the
rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling
about my ears. God help those who wander into
the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are
becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon
which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from
its craggy summit I looked out myself across the
melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted across
their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured
clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in
gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills.
In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the
mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose
above the trees. They were the only signs of hu-
man life which I could see, save only those prehis-
toric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the
hills. Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely
man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights
before.
</p>
<p>As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mor-
timer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moor-
land track which led from the outlying farmhouse
of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and
hardly a day has passed that he has not called at
the Hall to see how we were getting on. He in-
sisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he
gave me a lift homeward. I found him much trou-
bled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It
had wandered on to the moor and had never come
back. I gave him such consolation as I might, but
</p>
<p>633</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire, and I
do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Mortimer,&#8221; said I as we jolted
along the rough road, &#8220;I suppose there are few
people living within driving distance of this whom
you do not know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly any, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman
whose initials are L. L.?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There are a few gipsies and
labouring folk for whom I can&#8217;t answer, but among
the farmers or gentry there is no one whose ini-
tials are those. Wait a bit though,&#8221; he added after
a pause. &#8220;There is Laura Lyons&#8212;her initials are L.
L.&#8212;but she lives in Coombe Tracey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is Frankland&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Old Frankland the crank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons,
who came sketching on the moor. He proved to
be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from
what I hear may not have been entirely on one
side. Her father refused to have anything to do
with her because she had married without his con-
sent, and perhaps for one or two other reasons as
well. So, between the old sinner and the young
one the girl has had a pretty bad time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How does she live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance,
but it cannot be more, for his own affairs are con-
siderably involved. Whatever she may have de-
served one could not allow her to go hopelessly to
the bad. Her story got about, and several of the
people here did something to enable her to earn
an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir
Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It was
to set her up in a typewriting business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wanted to know the object of my inquiries,
but I managed to satisfy his curiosity without
telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. To-
morrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe
Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been
made towards clearing one incident in this chain
of mysteries. I am certainly developing the wis-
dom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed
his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him
casually to what type Frankland&#8217;s skull belonged,
and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of
</p>
<p>our drive. I have not lived for years with Sherlock
Holmes for nothing.
</p>
<p>I have only one other incident to record upon
this tempestuous and melancholy day. This was
my conversation with Barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which I can play in
due time.
</p>
<p>Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and
the baronet played e&#180;carte&#180; afterwards. The butler
brought me my coffee into the library, and I took
the chance to ask him a few questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;has this precious relation of
yours departed, or is he still lurking out yonder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has
gone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here!
I&#8217;ve not heard of him since I left out food for him
last, and that was three days ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see him then?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir, but the food was gone when next I
</p>
<p>went that way.&#8221;
&#8220;Then he was certainly there?&#8221;
&#8220;So you would think, sir, unless it was the other
</p>
<p>man who took it.&#8221;
I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and
</p>
<p>stared at Barrymore.
&#8220;You know that there is another man then?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know of him then?&#8221;
&#8220;Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or
</p>
<p>more. He&#8217;s in hiding, too, but he&#8217;s not a convict
as far as I can make out. I don&#8217;t like it, Dr. Wat-
son&#8212;I tell you straight, sir, that I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221; He
spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no inter-
est in this matter but that of your master. I have
come here with no object except to help him. Tell
me, frankly, what it is that you don&#8217;t like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he re-
gretted his outburst, or found it difficult to express
his own feelings in words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all these goings-on, sir,&#8221; he cried at last,
waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window
which faced the moor. &#8220;There&#8217;s foul play some-
where, and there&#8217;s black villainy brewing, to that
I&#8217;ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir
Henry on his way back to London again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it that alarms you?&#8221;
&#8220;Look at Sir Charles&#8217;s death! That was bad
</p>
<p>enough, for all that the coroner said. Look at the
noises on the moor at night. There&#8217;s not a man
would cross it after sundown if he was paid for
</p>
<p>634</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Man on the Tor
</p>
<p>it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and
watching and waiting! What&#8217;s he waiting for?
What does it mean? It means no good to anyone
of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be
to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry&#8217;s new
servants are ready to take over the Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But about this stranger,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Can you tell
me anything about him? What did Selden say?
Did he find out where he hid, or what he was do-
ing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep
one, and gives nothing away. At first he thought
that he was the police, but soon he found that he
had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he
was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing
he could not make out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did he say that he lived?&#8221;
&#8220;Among the old houses on the hillside&#8212;the
</p>
<p>stone huts where the old folk used to live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about his food?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Selden found out that he has got a lad who
works for him and brings him all he needs. I dare
say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of
this some other time.&#8221; When the butler had gone
I walked over to the black window, and I looked
through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and
at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It
is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in
a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of ha-
tred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a
place at such a time! And what deep and earnest
purpose can he have which calls for such a trial!
There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the
very centre of that problem which has vexed me
so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have
passed before I have done all that man can do to
reach the heart of the mystery.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.
The Man on the Tor
</p>
<p>The extract from my private diary which forms
the last chapter has brought my narrative up to
the 18th of October, a time when these strange
events began to move swiftly towards their ter-
rible conclusion. The incidents of the next few
days are indelibly graven upon my recollection,
and I can tell them without reference to the notes
made at the time. I start then from the day which
succeeded that upon which I had established two
facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura
Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles
Baskerville and made an appointment with him at
the very place and hour that he met his death, the
other that the lurking man upon the moor was to
be found among the stone huts upon the hill-side.
With these two facts in my possession I felt that
either my intelligence or my courage must be defi-
cient if I could not throw some further light upon
these dark places.
</p>
<p>I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I
had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening
before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at
