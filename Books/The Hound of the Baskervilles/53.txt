</p>
<p>has been played, and upon which we may help to
play it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a wild place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil
did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are yourself inclining to the super-
natural explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil&#8217;s agents may be of flesh and blood,
may they not? There are two questions waiting for
us at the outset. The one is whether any crime has
been committed at all; the second is, what is the
crime and how was it committed? Of course, if
Dr. Mortimer&#8217;s surmise should be correct, and we
are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But
we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses be-
fore falling back upon this one. I think we&#8217;ll shut
that window again, if you don&#8217;t mind. It is a sin-
gular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmo-
sphere helps a concentration of thought. I have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to
think, but that is the logical outcome of my con-
victions. Have you turned the case over in your
mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the
course of the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very bewildering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has certainly a character of its own. There
are points of distinction about it. That change in
the footprints, for example. What do you make of
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mortimer said that the man had walked on
tiptoe down that portion of the alley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He only repeated what some fool had said at
the inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe
down the alley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;
&#8220;He was running, Watson&#8212;running desper-
</p>
<p>ately, running for his life, running until he burst
his heart and fell dead upon his face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Running from what?&#8221;
&#8220;There lies our problem. There are indications
</p>
<p>that the man was crazed with fear before ever he
began to run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221;
&#8220;I am presuming that the cause of his fears
</p>
<p>came to him across the moor. If that were so, and
it seems most probable, only a man who had lost
his wits would have run from the house instead of
towards it. If the gipsy&#8217;s evidence may be taken
as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction
where help was least likely to be. Then, again,
whom was he waiting for that night, and why was
he waiting for him in the Yew Alley rather than in
his own house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that he was waiting for someone?&#8221;
&#8220;The man was elderly and infirm. We can
</p>
<p>understand his taking an evening stroll, but the
ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it
natural that he should stand for five or ten min-
utes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense
than I should have given him credit for, deduced
from the cigar ash?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he went out every evening.&#8221;
&#8220;I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-
</p>
<p>gate every evening. On the contrary, the evidence
is that he avoided the moor. That night he waited
there. It was the night before he made his depar-
ture for London. The thing takes shape, Watson.
It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand
me my violin, and we will postpone all further
thought upon this business until we have had the
advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry
Baskerville in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
Sir Henry Baskerville
</p>
<p>Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and
Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the
promised interview. Our clients were punctual to
</p>
<p>their appointment, for the clock had just struck
ten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed
by the young baronet. The latter was a small, alert,
</p>
<p>600</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Sir Henry Baskerville
</p>
<p>dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very stur-
dily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong,
pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed
suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one
who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
yet there was something in his steady eye and the
quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the
gentleman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Sir Henry Baskerville,&#8221; said Dr. Mor-
timer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and the strange thing is,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had
not proposed coming round to you this morning
I should have come on my own account. I under-
stand that you think out little puzzles, and I&#8217;ve had
one this morning which wants more thinking out
than I am able to give it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I under-
stand you to say that you have yourself had some
remarkable experience since you arrived in Lon-
don?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes.
Only a joke, as like as not. It was this letter, if you
can call it a letter, which reached me this morn-
ing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laid an envelope upon the table, and we
all bent over it. It was of common quality, gray-
ish in colour. The address, &#8220;Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel,&#8221; was printed in rough
characters; the postmark &#8220;Charing Cross,&#8221; and the
date of posting the preceding evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knew that you were going to the
Northumberland Hotel?&#8221; asked Holmes, glancing
keenly across at our visitor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could have known. We only decided
after I met Dr. Mortimer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stop-
ping there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I had been staying with a friend,&#8221; said the
doctor. &#8220;There was no possible indication that we
intended to go to this hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply in-
terested in your movements.&#8221; Out of the envelope
he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into
four. This he opened and spread flat upon the ta-
ble. Across the middle of it a single sentence had
been formed by the expedient of pasting printed
words upon it. It ran:
</p>
<p>As you value your life or your reason
keep away from the moor.
</p>
<p>The word &#8220;moor&#8221; only was printed in ink.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Sir Henry Baskerville, &#8220;perhaps
you will tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is
the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so
much interest in my affairs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You
must allow that there is nothing supernatural
about this, at any rate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, but it might very well come from
someone who was convinced that the business is
supernatural.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What business?&#8221; asked Sir Henry sharply. &#8220;It
seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great
deal more than I do about my own affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall share our knowledge before you
leave this room, Sir Henry. I promise you that,&#8221;
said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;We will confine ourselves
for the present with your permission to this very
interesting document, which must have been put
together and posted yesterday evening. Have you
yesterday&#8217;s Times, Watson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is here in the corner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I trouble you for it&#8212;the inside page,
please, with the leading articles?&#8221; He glanced
swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. &#8220;Capital article this on free trade. Permit
me to give you an extract from it.
</p>
<p>&#8220; &#8216;You may be cajoled into imagining that
your own special trade or your own indus-
try will be encouraged by a protective tar-
iff, but it stands to reason that such legisla-
tion must in the long run keep away wealth
from the country, diminish the value of our
imports, and lower the general conditions
of life in this island.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that, Watson?&#8221; cried
Holmes in high glee, rubbing his hands together
with satisfaction. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that is an ad-
mirable sentiment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air
of professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville
turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about the tariff and things
of that kind,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but it seems to me we&#8217;ve
got a bit off the trail so far as that note is con-
cerned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I think we are particularly
hot upon the trail, Sir Henry. Watson here knows
more about my methods than you do, but I fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance
of this sentence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I confess that I see no connection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>601</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very
close a connection that the one is extracted out
of the other. &#8216;You,&#8217; &#8216;your,&#8217; &#8216;your,&#8217; &#8216;life,&#8217; &#8216;reason,&#8217;
&#8216;value,&#8217; &#8216;keep away,&#8217; &#8216;from the.&#8217; Don&#8217;t you see now
whence these words have been taken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By thunder, you&#8217;re right! Well, if that isn&#8217;t
smart!&#8221; cried Sir Henry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If any possible doubt remained it is settled by
the fact that &#8216;keep away&#8217; and &#8216;from the&#8217; are cut out
in one piece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now&#8212;so it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything
which I could have imagined,&#8221; said Dr. Mortimer,
gazing at my friend in amazement. &#8220;I could under-
stand anyone saying that the words were from a
newspaper; but that you should name which, and
add that it came from the leading article, is really
one of the most remarkable things which I have
ever known. How did you do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull
of a negro from that of an Esquimau?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because that is my special hobby. The differ-
ences are obvious. The supra-orbital crest, the fa-
cial angle, the maxillary curve, the&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is my special hobby, and the differ-
ences are equally obvious. There is as much dif-
ference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois
type of a Times article and the slovenly print of
an evening half-penny paper as there could be be-
tween your negro and your Esquimau. The de-
tection of types is one of the most elementary
branches of knowledge to the special expert in
crime, though I confess that once when I was very
young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the West-
ern Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
distinctive, and these words could have been taken
from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the
strong probability was that we should find the
words in yesterday&#8217;s issue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said Sir Henry Baskerville, &#8220;someone cut out this
message with a scissors&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nail-scissors,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;You can see that
it was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter
had to take two snips over &#8216;keep away.&#8217; &#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. Someone, then, cut out the mes-
sage with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it
with paste&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gum,&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With gum on to the paper. But I want to know
why the word &#8216;moor&#8217; should have been written?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he could not find it in print. The other
words were all simple and might be found in any
issue, but &#8216;moor&#8217; would be less common.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, that would explain it. Have
you read anything else in this message, Mr.
Holmes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are one or two indications, and yet the
utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues.
The address, you observe is printed in rough char-
acters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom
found in any hands but those of the highly edu-
cated. We may take it, therefore, that the letter
was composed by an educated man who wished
to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to
conceal his own writing suggests that that writ-
ing might be known, or come to be known, by
you. Again, you will observe that the words are
not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some
are much higher than others. &#8216;Life,&#8217; for example
is quite out of its proper place. That may point to
carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry
upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline
to the latter view, since the matter was evidently
important, and it is unlikely that the composer of
such a letter would be careless. If he were in a
hurry it opens up the interesting question why he
should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up
to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an
interruption&#8212;and from whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming now rather into the region of
guesswork,&#8221; said Dr. Mortimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, rather, into the region where we balance
probabilities and choose the most likely. It is the
scientific use of the imagination, but we have al-
ways some material basis on which to start our
speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no
doubt, but I am almost certain that this address
has been written in a hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world can you say that?&#8221;
&#8220;If you examine it carefully you will see that
</p>
<p>both the pen and the ink have given the writer
trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single
word, and has run dry three times in a short ad-
dress, showing that there was very little ink in the
bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom
allowed to be in such a state, and the combination
of the two must be quite rare. But you know the
hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get
anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in
saying that could we examine the waste-paper bas-
kets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we
</p>
<p>602</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Sir Henry Baskerville
</p>
<p>found the remains of the mutilated Times leader
we could lay our hands straight upon the person
who sent this singular message. Halloa! Halloa!
What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon
which the words were pasted, holding it only an
inch or two from his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said he, throwing it down. &#8220;It is
</p>
<p>a blank half-sheet of paper, without even a water-
mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much
as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir
Henry, has anything else of interest happened to
you since you have been in London?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.&#8221;
&#8220;You have not observed anyone follow or
</p>
<p>watch you?&#8221;
&#8220;I seem to have walked right into the thick of
</p>
<p>a dime novel,&#8221; said our visitor. &#8220;Why in thunder
should anyone follow or watch me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming to that. You have nothing else
to report to us before we go into this matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it depends upon what you think worth
reporting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think anything out of the ordinary routine of
life well worth reporting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry smiled.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much of British life yet, for I
</p>
<p>have spent nearly all my time in the States and in
Canada. But I hope that to lose one of your boots is
not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have lost one of your boots?&#8221;
&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; cried Dr. Mortimer, &#8220;it is only
</p>
<p>mislaid. You will find it when you return to the
hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes
with trifles of this kind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he asked me for anything outside the or-
dinary routine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;however foolish the
incident may seem. You have lost one of your
boots, you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both out-
side my door last night, and there was only one in
the morning. I could get no sense out of the chap
who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only
bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have
never had them on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have never worn them, why did you
put them out to be cleaned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were tan boots and had never been var-
nished. That was why I put them out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I understand that on your arrival in Lon-
don yesterday you went out at once and bought a
pair of boots?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer
here went round with me. You see, if I am to
be squire down there I must dress the part, and
it may be that I have got a little careless in my
ways out West. Among other things I bought these
brown boots&#8212;gave six dollars for them&#8212;and had
one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,&#8221;
said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;I confess that I share Dr.
Mortimer&#8217;s belief that it will not be long before the
missing boot is found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, now, gentlemen,&#8221; said the baronet with
decision, &#8220;it seems to me that I have spoken quite
enough about the little that I know. It is time that
you kept your promise and gave me a full account
of what we are all driving at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your request is a very reasonable one,&#8221;
Holmes answered. &#8220;Dr. Mortimer, I think you
could not do better than to tell your story as you
told it to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his
papers from his pocket, and presented the whole
case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir
Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest atten-
tion, and with an occasional exclamation of sur-
prise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance
with a vengeance,&#8221; said he when the long narrative
was finished. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ve heard of the hound
ever since I was in the nursery. It&#8217;s the pet story
of the family, though I never thought of taking it
seriously before. But as to my uncle&#8217;s death&#8212;well,
it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can&#8217;t get
it clear yet. You don&#8217;t seem quite to have made up
your mind whether it&#8217;s a case for a policeman or a
clergyman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now there&#8217;s this affair of the letter to me
at the hotel. I suppose that fits into its place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to show that someone knows more
than we do about what goes on upon the moor,&#8221;
said Dr. Mortimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And also,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;that someone is not
ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of
danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or it may be that they wish, for their own pur-
poses, to scare me away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>603</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very
much indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introduc-
ing me to a problem which presents several inter-
esting alternatives. But the practical point which
we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it
is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville
Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I not go?&#8221;
&#8220;There seems to be danger.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you mean danger from this family fiend or
</p>
<p>do you mean danger from human beings?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, that is what we have to find out.&#8221;
&#8220;Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is
</p>
<p>no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man
upon earth who can prevent me from going to the
home of my own people, and you may take that to
be my final answer.&#8221; His dark brows knitted and
his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It was
evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles
was not extinct in this their last representative.
&#8220;Meanwhile,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have hardly had time to
think over all that you have told me. It&#8217;s a big
thing for a man to have to understand and to de-
cide at one sitting. I should like to have a quiet
hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look
here, Mr. Holmes, it&#8217;s half-past eleven now and I
am going back right away to my hotel. Suppose
you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and
lunch with us at two. I&#8217;ll be able to tell you more
clearly then how this thing strikes me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that convenient to you, Watson?&#8221;
&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab
</p>
<p>called?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried
</p>
<p>me rather.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,&#8221; said his
</p>
<p>companion.
&#8220;Then we meet again at two o&#8217;clock. Au revoir,
</p>
<p>and good-morning!&#8221;
We heard the steps of our visitors descend the
</p>
<p>stair and the bang of the front door. In an instant
Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to
the man of action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a
moment to lose!&#8221; He rushed into his room in his
dressing-gown and was back again in a few sec-
onds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down
the stairs and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and
Baskerville were still visible about two hundred
yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I run on and stop them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am per-
fectly satisfied with your company if you will tol-
erate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is certainly
a very fine morning for a walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He quickened his pace until we had decreased
the distance which divided us by about half. Then,
still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed
into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.
Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop
window, upon which Holmes did the same. An
instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfac-
tion, and, following the direction of his eager eyes,
I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which
had halted on the other side of the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s our man, Watson! Come along! We&#8217;ll
have a good look at him, if we can do no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that instant I was aware of a bushy black
beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us
through the side window of the cab. Instantly
the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was
screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off
down Regent Street. Holmes looked eagerly round
for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then
he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the
traffic, but the start was too great, and already the
cab was out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There now!&#8221; said Holmes bitterly as he
emerged panting and white with vexation from the
tide of vehicles. &#8220;Was ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are
an honest man you will record this also and set it
against my successes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the man?&#8221;
&#8220;I have not an idea.&#8221;
&#8220;A spy?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it was evident from what we have heard
</p>
<p>that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed
by someone since he has been in town. How
else could it be known so quickly that it was the
Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If
they had followed him the first day I argued that
they would follow him also the second. You may
have observed that I twice strolled over to the win-
dow while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember.&#8221;
&#8220;I was looking out for loiterers in the street,
</p>
<p>but I saw none. We are dealing with a clever man,
Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and though
I have not finally made up my mind whether it
is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in
touch with us, I am conscious always of power and
design. When our friends left I at once followed
them in the hopes of marking down their invisible
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Sir Henry Baskerville
</p>
<p>attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted
himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of
a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past
them and so escape their notice. His method had
the additional advantage that if they were to take
a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, how-
ever, one obvious disadvantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It puts him in the power of the cabman.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
&#8220;What a pity we did not get the number!&#8221;
&#8220;My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you
</p>
<p>surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to
get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But that is
no use to us for the moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see how you could have done more.&#8221;
&#8220;On observing the cab I should have instantly
</p>
<p>turned and walked in the other direction. I should
then at my leisure have hired a second cab and
followed the first at a respectful distance, or, bet-
ter still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel
and waited there. When our unknown had fol-
lowed Baskerville home we should have had the
opportunity of playing his own game upon him-
self and seeing where he made for. As it is, by
an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advan-
tage of with extraordinary quickness and energy
by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and
lost our man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We had been sauntering slowly down Regent
Street during this conversation, and Dr. Mortimer,
with his companion, had long vanished in front of
us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no object in our following them,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;The shadow has departed and will not
return. We must see what further cards we have
in our hands and play them with decision. Could
you swear to that man&#8217;s face within the cab?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could swear only to the beard.&#8221;
&#8220;And so could I&#8212;from which I gather that in
</p>
<p>all probability it was a false one. A clever man
upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard
save to conceal his features. Come in here, Wat-
son!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned into one of the district messenger
offices, where he was warmly greeted by the man-
ager.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the
little case in which I had the good fortune to help
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good
name, and perhaps my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some
recollection, Wilson, that you had among your
boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some
ability during the investigation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he is still with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you ring him up?&#8212;thank you! And I
should be glad to have change of this five-pound
note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had
obeyed the summons of the manager. He stood
now gazing with great reverence at the famous de-
tective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me have the Hotel Directory,&#8221; said
Holmes. &#8220;Thank you! Now, Cartwright, there are
the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the
immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do
you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will visit each of these in turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will begin in each case by giving the out-
side porter one shilling. Here are twenty-three
shillings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will tell him that you want to see the
waste-paper of yesterday. You will say that an im-
portant telegram has miscarried and that you are
looking for it. You understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what you are really looking for is the cen-
tre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with
scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It is this page.
You could easily recognize it, could you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In each case the outside porter will send for
the hall porter, to whom also you will give a
shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You
will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the
twenty-three that the waste of the day before has
been burned or removed. In the three other cases
you will be shown a heap of paper and you will
look for this page of the Times among it. The odds
are enormously against your finding it. There
are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let
me have a report by wire at Baker Street before
evening. And now, Watson, it only remains for us
to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No.
2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond
Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we
are due at the hotel.&#8221;

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
Three Broken Threads
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable
degree, the power of detaching his mind at will.
For two hours the strange business in which we
had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and
he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the
modern Belgian masters. He would talk of noth-
ing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from
our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at
the Northumberland Hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting
you,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;He asked me to show you
up at once when you came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any objection to my looking at your
register?&#8221; said Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least.&#8221;
The book showed that two names had been
</p>
<p>added after that of Baskerville. One was
Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the
other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Al-
ton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely that must be the same Johnson whom
I used to know,&#8221; said Holmes to the porter. &#8220;A
lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a
limp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a
very active gentleman, not older than yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you are mistaken about his trade?&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years,
</p>
<p>and he is very well known to us.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem
</p>
<p>to remember the name. Excuse my curiosity, but
often in calling upon one friend one finds an-
other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was
once mayor of Gloucester. She always comes to us
when she is in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her ac-
quaintance. We have established a most important
fact by these questions, Watson,&#8221; he continued in
a low voice as we went upstairs together. &#8220;We
know now that
