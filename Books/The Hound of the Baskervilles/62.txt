<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>My friend spoke in his frankest and most un-
concerned manner. Stapleton still looked hard at
him. Then he turned to me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to
my house, but it would give my sister such a fright
that I do not feel justified in doing it. I think that
if we put something over his face he will be safe
until morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so it was arranged. Resisting Staple-
ton&#8217;s offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to
Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return
alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving
slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him
that one black smudge on the silvered slope which
showed where the man was lying who had come
so horribly to his end.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.
Fixing the Nets
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at close grips at last,&#8221; said Holmes as
we walked together across the moor. &#8220;What a
nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself to-
gether in the face of what must have been a para-
lyzing shock when he found that the wrong man
had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in
London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that
we have never had a foeman more worthy of our
steel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that he has seen you.&#8221;
&#8220;And so was I at first. But there was no getting
</p>
<p>out of it.&#8221;
&#8220;What effect do you think it will have upon his
</p>
<p>plans now that he knows you are here?&#8221;
&#8220;It may cause him to be more cautious, or it
</p>
<p>may drive him to desperate measures at once. Like
most clever criminals, he may be too confident in
his own cleverness and imagine that he has com-
pletely deceived us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we not arrest him at once?&#8221;
&#8220;My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of
</p>
<p>action. Your instinct is always to do something en-
ergetic. But supposing, for argument&#8217;s sake, that
we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the
better off should we be for that? We could prove
nothing against him. There&#8217;s the devilish cunning
of it! If he were acting through a human agent we
could get some evidence, but if we were to drag
this great dog to the light of day it would not help
us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely we have a case.&#8221;
&#8220;Not a shadow of one&#8212;only surmise and con-
</p>
<p>jecture. We should be laughed out of court if we
came with such a story and such evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Sir Charles&#8217;s death.&#8221;
&#8220;Found dead without a mark upon him. You
</p>
<p>and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we
know also what frightened him; but how are we to
get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs
are there of a hound? Where are the marks of its
fangs? Of course we know that a hound does not
bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead
before ever the brute overtook him. But we have
to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, to-night?&#8221;
&#8220;We are not much better off to-night. Again,
</p>
<p>there was no direct connection between the hound
and the man&#8217;s death. We never saw the hound.
We heard it; but we could not prove that it was
running upon this man&#8217;s trail. There is a complete
absence of motive. No, my dear fellow; we must
reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case
at present, and that it is worth our while to run
any risk in order to establish one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do you propose to do so?&#8221;
&#8220;I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons
</p>
<p>may do for us when the position of affairs is made
clear to her. And I have my own plan as well. Suf-
ficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof; but I hope
before the day is past to have the upper hand at
last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could draw nothing further from him, and he
walked, lost in thought, as far as the Baskerville
gates.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you coming up?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes; I see no reason for further concealment.
</p>
<p>But one last word, Watson. Say nothing of the
hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that Selden&#8217;s
</p>
<p>646</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Fixing the Nets
</p>
<p>death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He
will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he
will have to undergo to-morrow, when he is en-
gaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine
with these people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must excuse yourself and he must
go alone. That will be easily arranged. And now,
if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are
both ready for our suppers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to
see Sherlock Holmes, for he had for some days
been expecting that recent events would bring him
down from London. He did raise his eyebrows,
however, when he found that my friend had nei-
ther any luggage nor any explanations for its ab-
sence. Between us we soon supplied his wants,
and then over a belated supper we explained to the
baronet as much of our experience as it seemed de-
sirable that he should know. But first I had the un-
pleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore
and his wife. To him it may have been an unmit-
igated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron.
To all the world he was the man of violence, half
animal and half demon; but to her he always re-
mained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood,
the child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed
is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been moping in the house all day since
Watson went off in the morning,&#8221; said the baronet.
&#8220;I guess I should have some credit, for I have kept
my promise. If I hadn&#8217;t sworn not to go about
alone I might have had a more lively evening, for
I had a message from Stapleton asking me over
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that you would have had a
more lively evening,&#8221; said Holmes drily. &#8220;By the
way, I don&#8217;t suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your
neck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sir Henry opened his eyes. &#8220;How was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes.
I fear your servant who gave them to him may get
into trouble with the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of
them, as far as I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky for him&#8212;in fact, it&#8217;s lucky for all
of you, since you are all on the wrong side of the
law in this matter. I am not sure that as a con-
scientious detective my first duty is not to arrest
the whole household. Watson&#8217;s reports are most
incriminating documents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about the case?&#8221; asked the baronet.
&#8220;Have you made anything out of the tangle? I
don&#8217;t know that Watson and I are much the wiser
since we came down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I shall be in a position to make the
situation rather more clear to you before long. It
has been an exceedingly difficult and most com-
plicated business. There are several points upon
which we still want light&#8212;but it is coming all the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had one experience, as Watson has no
doubt told you. We heard the hound on the moor,
so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
I had something to do with dogs when I was out
West, and I know one when I hear one. If you
can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I&#8217;ll be
ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I will muzzle him and chain him all
right if you will give me your help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you tell me to do I will do.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good; and I will ask you also to do it
</p>
<p>blindly, without always asking the reason.&#8221;
&#8220;Just as you like.&#8221;
&#8220;If you will do this I think the chances are that
</p>
<p>our little problem will soon be solved. I have no
doubt&#8212;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up
over my head into the air. The lamp beat upon
his face, and so intent was it and so still that it
might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue,
a personification of alertness and expectation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; we both cried.
I could see as he looked down that he was re-
</p>
<p>pressing some internal emotion. His features were
still composed, but his eyes shone with amused
exultation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,&#8221; said
he as he waved his hand towards the line of por-
traits which covered the opposite wall. &#8220;Watson
won&#8217;t allow that I know anything of art, but that is
mere jealousy, because our views upon the subject
differ. Now, these are a really very fine series of
portraits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear you say so,&#8221; said Sir
Henry, glancing with some surprise at my friend.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t pretend to know much about these things,
and I&#8217;d be a better judge of a horse or a steer than
of a picture. I didn&#8217;t know that you found time for
such things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what is good when I see it, and I see
it now. That&#8217;s a Kneller, I&#8217;ll swear, that lady in
the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman
</p>
<p>647</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all
family portraits, I presume?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one.&#8221;
&#8220;Do you know the names?&#8221;
&#8220;Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and
</p>
<p>I think I can say my lessons fairly well.&#8221;
&#8220;Who is the gentleman with the telescope?&#8221;
&#8220;That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served
</p>
<p>under Rodney in the West Indies. The man with
the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William
Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of
the House of Commons under Pitt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this Cavalier opposite to me&#8212;the one
with the black velvet and the lace?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you have a right to know about him. That
is the cause of all the mischief, the wicked Hugo,
who started the Hound of the Baskervilles. We&#8217;re
not likely to forget him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I gazed with interest and some surprise upon
the portrait.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;he seems a quiet,
meek-mannered man enough, but I dare say that
there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pic-
tured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about the authenticity, for
the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the
canvas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes said little more, but the picture of the
old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him,
and his eyes were continually fixed upon it dur-
ing supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry
had gone to his room, that I was able to follow
the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the
banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand,
and he held it up against the time-stained portrait
on the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see anything there?&#8221;
I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curl-
</p>
<p>ing love-locks, the white lace collar, and the
straight, severe face which was framed between
them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was
prim, hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped
mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it like anyone you know?&#8221;
&#8220;There is something of Sir Henry about the
</p>
<p>jaw.&#8221;
&#8220;Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an in-
</p>
<p>stant!&#8221; He stood upon a chair, and, holding up the
light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over
the broad hat and round the long ringlets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; I cried, in amazement.
</p>
<p>The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the
canvas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained
to examine faces and not their trimmings. It is
the first quality of a criminal investigator that he
should see through a disguise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is marvellous. It might be his por-
trait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throw-
back, which appears to be both physical and spiri-
tual. A study of family portraits is enough to con-
vert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The
fellow is a Baskerville&#8212;that is evident.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With designs upon the succession.&#8221;
&#8220;Exactly. This chance of the picture has sup-
</p>
<p>plied us with one of our most obvious missing
links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and
I dare swear that before to-morrow night he will
be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his
own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and we
add him to the Baker Street collection!&#8221; He burst
into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned
away from the picture. I have not heard him laugh
often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.
</p>
<p>I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes
was afoot earlier still, for I saw him as I dressed,
coming up the drive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we should have a full day to-day,&#8221; he re-
marked, and he rubbed his hands with the joy of
action. &#8220;The nets are all in place, and the drag is
about to begin. We&#8217;ll know before the day is out
whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike,
or whether he has got through the meshes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been on the moor already?&#8221;
&#8220;I have sent a report from Grimpen to Prince-
</p>
<p>town as to the death of Selden. I think I can
promise that none of you will be troubled in
the matter. And I have also communicated with
my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have
pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at
his master&#8217;s grave, if I had not set his mind at rest
about my safety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the next move?&#8221;
&#8220;To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!&#8221;
&#8220;Good morning, Holmes,&#8221; said the baronet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a general who is planning a battle
with his chief of the staff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the exact situation. Watson was asking
for orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so do I.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good. You are engaged, as I understand,
</p>
<p>to dine with our friends the Stapletons to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>648</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Fixing the Nets
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that you will come also. They are very
hospitable people, and I am sure that they would
be very glad to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that Watson and I must go to London.&#8221;
&#8220;To London?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I think that we should be more useful
</p>
<p>there at the present juncture.&#8221;
The baronet&#8217;s face perceptibly lengthened.
&#8220;I hoped that you were going to see me
</p>
<p>through this business. The Hall and the moor are
not very pleasant places when one is alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly
and do exactly what I tell you. You can tell your
friends that we should have been happy to have
come with you, but that urgent business required
us to be in town. We hope very soon to return to
Devonshire. Will you remember to give them that
message?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist upon it.&#8221;
&#8220;There is no alternative, I assure you.&#8221;
I saw by the baronet&#8217;s clouded brow that he
</p>
<p>was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our de-
sertion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you desire to go?&#8221; he asked coldly.
&#8220;Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in
</p>
<p>to Coombe Tracey, but Watson will leave his things
as a pledge that he will come back to you. Watson,
you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that
you regret that you cannot come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a good mind to go to London with
you,&#8221; said the baronet. &#8220;Why should I stay here
alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is your post of duty. Because you
gave me your word that you would do as you were
told, and I tell you to stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;
&#8220;One more direction! I wish you to drive to
</p>
<p>Merripit House. Send back your trap, however,
and let them know that you intend to walk home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To walk across the moor?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
&#8220;But that is the very thing which you have so
</p>
<p>often cautioned me not to do.&#8221;
&#8220;This time you may do it with safety. If I had
</p>
<p>not every confidence in your nerve and courage I
would not suggest it, but it is essential that you
should do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will do it.&#8221;
&#8220;And as you value your life do not go across
</p>
<p>the moor in any direction save along the straight
</p>
<p>path which leads from Merripit House to the
Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do just what you say.&#8221;
&#8220;Very good. I should be glad to get away as
</p>
<p>soon after breakfast as possible, so as to reach Lon-
don in the afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was much astounded by this programme,
though I remembered that Holmes had said to Sta-
pleton on the night before that his visit would ter-
minate next day. It had not crossed my mind, how-
ever, that he would wish me to go with him, nor
could I understand how we could both be absent
at a moment which he himself declared to be crit-
ical. There was nothing for it, however, but im-
plicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rue-
ful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we
were at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dis-
patched the trap upon its return journey. A small
boy was waiting upon the platform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any orders, sir?&#8221;
&#8220;You will take this train to town, Cartwright.
</p>
<p>The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir
Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he
finds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is
to send it by registered post to Baker Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;And ask at the station office if there is a mes-
</p>
<p>sage for me.&#8221;
The boy returned with a telegram, which
</p>
<p>Holmes handed to me. It ran:
</p>
<p>Wire received. Coming down with un-
signed warrant. Arrive five-forty.
</p>
<p>&#8212; Lestrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is in answer to mine of this morning. He
is the best of the professionals, I think, and we
may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I think that
we cannot employ our time better than by calling
upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His plan of campaign was beginning to be evi-
dent. He would use the baronet in order to con-
vince the Stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant
when we were likely to be needed. That telegram
from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Sta-
pletons, must remove the last suspicions from their
minds. Already I seemed to see our nets drawing
closer around that lean-jawed pike.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sher-
lock Holmes opened his interview with a frank-
ness and directness which considerably amazed
her.
</p>
<p>649</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am investigating the circumstances which
attended the death of the late Sir Charles
Baskerville,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My friend here, Dr. Watson,
has informed me of what you have communicated,
and also of what you have withheld in connection
with that matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I withheld?&#8221; she asked defiantly.
&#8220;You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles
</p>
<p>to be at the gate at ten o&#8217;clock. We know that that
was the place and hour of his death. You have
withheld what the connection is between these
events.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no connection.&#8221;
&#8220;In that case the coincidence must indeed be an
</p>
<p>extraordinary one. But I think that we shall suc-
ceed in establishing a connection after all. I wish
to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We re-
gard this case as one of murder, and the evidence
may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton,
but his wife as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady sprang from her chair.
&#8220;His wife!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;The fact is no longer a secret. The person who
</p>
<p>has passed for his sister is really his wife.&#8221;
Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands
</p>
<p>were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that
the pink nails had turned white with the pressure
of her grip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife!&#8221; she said again. &#8220;His wife! He is not
a married man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can
</p>
<p>do so&#8212;!&#8221; The fierce flash of her eyes said more
than any words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come prepared to do so,&#8221; said Holmes,
drawing several papers from his pocket. &#8220;Here is a
photograph of the couple taken in York four years
ago. It is indorsed &#8216;Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,&#8217; but
you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and
her also, if you know her by sight. Here are three
written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of
Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St.
Oliver&#8217;s private school. Read them and see if you
can doubt the identity of these people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced at them, and then looked up at us
with the set, rigid face of a desperate woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Holmes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this man had offered
me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce
from my husband. He has lied to me, the villain,
in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth
has he ever told me. And why&#8212;why? I imagined
that all was for my own sake. But now I see that I
</p>
<p>was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why
should I preserve faith with him who never kept
any with me? Why should I try to shield him from
the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me
what you like, and there is nothing which I shall
hold back. One thing I swear to you, and that is
that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of
any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my
kindest friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I entirely believe you, madam,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes. &#8220;The recital of these events must be very

&#8220;He told me that it would hurt his self-respect
</p>
<p>that any other man should find the money for such
an object, and that though he was a poor man him-
self he would devote his last penny to removing
the obstacles which divided us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He appears to be a very consistent character.
And then you heard nothing until you read the re-
ports of the death in the paper?&#8221;

</p>
<p>your appoint
