</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
The Curse of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have in my pocket a manuscript,&#8221; said Dr.
James Mortimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I observed it as you entered the room,&#8221; said
Holmes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an old manuscript.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Early eighteenth century, unless it is a
forgery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you say that, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have presented an inch or two of it to my
examination all the time that you have been talk-
ing. It would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. You
may possibly have read my little monograph upon
the subject. I put that at 1730.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The exact date is 1742.&#8221; Dr. Mortimer drew
it from his breast-pocket. &#8220;This family paper was
committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months
ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I
may say that I was his personal friend as well as
his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded
man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative
as I am myself. Yet he took this document very
seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such
an end as did eventually overtake him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the
manuscript and flattened it upon his knee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will observe, Watson, the alternative use
of the long s and the short. It is one of several
indications which enabled me to fix the date.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper
and the faded script. At the head was written:
&#8220;Baskerville Hall,&#8221; and below in large, scrawling
figures: &#8220;1742.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears to be a statement of some sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which
runs in the Baskerville family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I understand that it is something more
modern and practical upon which you wish to
consult me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most modern. A most practical, pressing mat-
ter, which must be decided within twenty-four
hours. But the manuscript is short and is inti-
mately connected with the affair. With your per-
mission I will read it to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his
finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with
an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
</p>
<p>manuscript to the light and read in a high, crack-
ing voice the following curious, old-world narra-
tive:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the origin of the Hound of the
Baskervilles there have been many state-
ments, yet as I come in a direct line from
Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story
from my father, who also had it from his,
I have set it down with all belief that it
occurred even as is here set forth. And I
would have you believe, my sons, that the
same Justice which punishes sin may also
most graciously forgive it, and that no ban
is so heavy but that by prayer and repen-
tance it may be removed. Learn then from
this story not to fear the fruits of the past,
but rather to be circumspect in the future,
that those foul passions whereby our family
has suffered so grievously may not again be
loosed to our undoing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Know then that in the time of the Great
Rebellion (the history of which by the
learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly
commend to your attention) this Manor of
Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name,
nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most
wild, profane, and godless man. This, in
truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
seeing that saints have never flourished in
those parts, but there was in him a cer-
tain wanton and cruel humour which made
his name a byword through the West. It
chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, in-
deed, so dark a passion may be known un-
der so bright a name) the daughter of a yeo-
man who held lands near the Baskerville es-
tate. But the young maiden, being discreet
and of good repute, would ever avoid him,
for she feared his evil name. So it came to
pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with
five or six of his idle and wicked compan-
ions, stole down upon the farm and carried
off the maiden, her father and brothers be-
ing from home, as he well knew. When they
had brought her to the Hall the maiden was
placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo
and his friends sat down to a long carouse,
as was their nightly custom. Now, the
poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits
turned at the singing and shouting and ter-
rible oaths which came up to her from be-
</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Curse of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>low, for they say that the words used by
Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine,
were such as might blast the man who said
them. At last in the stress of her fear she did
that which might have daunted the bravest
or most active man, for by the aid of the
growth of ivy which covered (and still cov-
ers) the south wall she came down from un-
der the eaves, and so homeward across the
moor, there being three leagues betwixt the
Hall and her father&#8217;s farm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It chanced that some little time later
Hugo left his guests to carry food and
drink&#8212;with other worse things, per-
chance&#8212;to his captive, and so found the
cage empty and the bird escaped. Then,
as it would seem, he became as one that
hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs
into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the
great table, flagons and trenchers flying be-
fore him, and he cried aloud before all the
company that he would that very night ren-
der his body and soul to the Powers of Evil
if he might but overtake the wench. And
while the revellers stood aghast at the fury
of the man, one more wicked or, it may
be, more drunken than the rest, cried out
that they should put the hounds upon her.
Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying
to his grooms that they should saddle his
mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the
hounds a kerchief of the maid&#8217;s, he swung
them to the line, and so off full cry in the
moonlight over the moor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, for some space the revellers stood
agape, unable to understand all that had
been done in such haste. But anon their be-
mused wits awoke to the nature of the deed
which was like to be done upon the moor-
lands. Everything was now in an uproar,
some calling for their pistols, some for their
horses, and some for another flask of wine.
But at length some sense came back to their
crazed minds, and the whole of them, thir-
teen in number, took horse and started in
pursuit. The moon shone clear above them,
and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that
course which the maid must needs have
taken if she were to reach her own home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They had gone a mile or two when they
passed one of the night shepherds upon the
moorlands, and they cried to him to know
if he had seen the hunt. And the man,
as the story goes, was so crazed with fear
</p>
<p>that he could scarce speak, but at last he
said that he had indeed seen the unhappy
maiden, with the hounds upon her track.
&#8216;But I have seen more than that,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his
black mare, and there ran mute behind him
such a hound of hell as God forbid should
ever be at my heels.&#8217; So the drunken squires
cursed the shepherd and rode onward. But
soon their skins turned cold, for there came
a galloping across the moor, and the black
mare, dabbled with white froth, went past
with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then
the revellers rode close together, for a great
fear was on them, but they still followed
over the moor, though each, had he been
alone, would have been right glad to have
turned his horse&#8217;s head. Riding slowly in
this fashion they came at last upon the
hounds. These, though known for their val-
our and their breed, were whimpering in a
cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,
as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking
away and some, with starting hackles and
staring eyes, gazing down the narrow val-
ley before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The company had come to a halt, more
sober men, as you may guess, than when
they started. The most of them would by no
means advance, but three of them, the bold-
est, or it may be the most drunken, rode for-
ward down the goyal. Now, it opened into
a broad space in which stood two of those
great stones, still to be seen there, which
were set by certain forgotten peoples in the
days of old. The moon was shining bright
upon the clearing, and there in the centre
lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,
dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not
the sight of her body, nor yet was it that
of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near
her, which raised the hair upon the heads
of these three daredevil roysterers, but it
was that, standing over Hugo, and pluck-
ing at his throat, there stood a foul thing,
a great, black beast, shaped like a hound,
yet larger than any hound that ever mor-
tal eye has rested upon. And even as they
looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo
Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blaz-
ing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the
three shrieked with fear and rode for dear
life, still screaming, across the moor. One,
it is said, died that very night of what he
had seen, and the other twain were but bro-

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Hound of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>ken men for the rest of their days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming
of the hound which is said to have plagued
the family so sorely ever since. If I have set
it down it is because that which is clearly
known hath less terror than that which is
but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be
denied that many of the family have been
unhappy in their deaths, which have been
sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may
we shelter ourselves in the infinite good-
ness of Providence, which would not for-
ever punish the innocent beyond that third
or fourth generation which is threatened in
Holy Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I
hereby commend you, and I counsel you by
way of caution to forbear from crossing the
moor in those dark hours when the powers
of evil are exalted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons
Rodger and John, with instructions that
they say nothing thereof to their sister Eliz-
abeth.]&#8220;
</p>
<p>When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this
singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on
his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of
his cigarette into the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not find it interesting?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To a collector of fairy tales.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of
his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you some-
thing a little more recent. This is the Devon County
Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short ac-
count of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles
Baskerville which occurred a few days before that
date.&#8221;
</p>
<p>My friend leaned a little forward and his ex-
pression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his
glasses and began:&#8212;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent sudden death of Sir Charles
Baskerville, whose name has been men-
tioned as the probable Liberal candidate for
Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a
gloom over the county. Though Sir Charles
had resided at Baskerville Hall for a com-
paratively short period his amiability of
character and extreme generosity had won
the affection and respect of all who had
been brought into contact with him. In
</p>
<p>these days of nouveaux riches it is refresh-
ing to find a case where the scion of an old
county family which has fallen upon evil
days is able to make his own fortune and to
bring it back with him to restore the fallen
grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well
known, made large sums of money in South
African speculation. More wise than those
who go on until the wheel turns against
them, he realized his gains and returned to
England with them. It is only two years
since he took up his residence at Baskerville
Hall, and it is common talk how large were
those schemes of reconstruction and im-
provement which have been interrupted by
his death. Being himself childless, it was
his openly expressed desire that the whole
country-side should, within his own life-
time, profit by his good fortune, and many
will have personal reasons for bewailing his
untimely end. His generous donations to
local and county charities have been fre-
quently chronicled in these columns.
&#8220;The circumstances connected with the
death of Sir Charles cannot be said to have
been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but
at least enough has been done to dispose
of those rumours to which local supersti-
tion has given rise. There is no reason
whatever to suspect foul play, or to imag-
ine that death could be from any but nat-
ural causes. Sir Charles was a widower,
and a man who may be said to have been in
some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In
spite of his considerable wealth he was sim-
ple in his personal tastes, and his indoor
servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a
married couple named Barrymore, the hus-
band acting as butler and the wife as house-
keeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that
of several friends, tends to show that Sir
Charles&#8217;s health has for some time been im-
paired, and points especially to some af-
fection of the heart, manifesting itself in
changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute
attacks of nervous depression. Dr. James
Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant
of the deceased, has given evidence to the
same effect.
&#8220;The facts of the case are simple. Sir
Charles Baskerville was in the habit every
night before going to bed of walking down
the famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall.
The evidence of the Barrymores shows that
this had been his custom. On the 4th of
</p>
<p>594</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Curse of the Baskervilles
</p>
<p>May Sir Charles had declared his inten-
tion of starting next day for London, and
had ordered Barrymore to prepare his lug-
gage. That night he went out as usual for
his nocturnal walk, in the course of which
he was in the habit of smoking a cigar.
He never returned. At twelve o&#8217;clock Bar-
rymore, finding the hall door still open,
became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern,
went in search of his master. The day had
been wet, and Sir Charles&#8217;s footmarks were
easily traced down the Alley. Half-way
down this walk there is a gate which leads
out on to the moor. There were indications
that Sir Charles had stood for some little
time here. He then proceeded down the Al-
ley, and it was at the far end of it that his
body was discovered. One fact which has
not been explained is the statement of Bar-
rymore that his master&#8217;s footprints altered
their character from the time that he passed
the moor-gate, and that he appeared from
thence onward to have been walking upon
his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer,
was on the moor at no great distance at the
time, but he appears by his own confession
to have been the worse for drink. He de-
clares that he heard cries, but is unable to
state from what direction they came. No
signs of violence were to be discovered upon
Sir Charles&#8217;s person, and though the doc-
tor&#8217;s evidence pointed to an almost incredi-
ble facial distortion&#8212;so great that Dr. Mor-
timer refused at first to believe that it was
indeed his frien
